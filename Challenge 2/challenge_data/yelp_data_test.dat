0;6/8/2011;MyNjnxzZVTPq;IFTr6_6NI4CgCVavIL9k5g;Let me begin by saying that there are two kinds of people, those who will give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars and rave about it to everyone they know, or... people who can't get past the broken phone, blood stains, beeping fire alarms, peg-legged receptionist, lack of water pressure, cracked walls, strange smells, questionable elevator, televisions left to die after the digital conversion, and the possibility that the air conditioner may fall out the window at any moment. That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.;5;18;11;28;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg
1;8/30/2011;BdD7fsPqHQL73hwENEDT-Q;c_-hF15XgNhlyy_TqzmdaA;The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.;3;0;3;4;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg
2;6/26/2009;BfhqiyfC;CiwZ6S5ZizAFL5gypf8tLA;I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don't know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn't be signing another lease, essentially leaving me "pre-homeless". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I'm quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me "pre-unemployed". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I'm finally choosing my path, I'm hitting bottom. I'm giving up. Shit maybe I'm Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the "Hotel Tokyo". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I'm going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I'll need help, I'll need guidance.;5;12;14;23;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg
3;12/2/2011;cQdmhpNvyBv8nHEoxQdq9w;NwRVNIRIH7ICYbhJ2LhbKw;I'm a SPG Platinum member and can't believe that Starwood even keeps this property in their portfolio.  I'm writing from the dingy room as we speak. Pro:  It was $100 for a Thursday-Sunday room in early December, when prices usually spike around the Magnificent Mile. Cons: only 1 (slow) elevator, very old and dingy decor, poor front desk service, no movies, very few electrical plugs. I could have chosen between the Hampton Inn and Tremont.  I stayed at the Hampton  a month ago and should have stayed there again.  Yes it's cheap and close to Michigan Ave, but if you are a business traveller and accustomed to SPG standards, this is not your place!;2;1;1;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
4;6/3/2012;kgVxanwQ0fbPKOq-o6b9GA;ARDNgwRWVUmBOm5bzvi-KA;Pros: fantastic location at a good price, stately building, big comfortable bed Cons: slightly smelly room, horrible hot water pressure, no on-command movie TV system, front desk usually unoccupied Overall: would use again, but first would try other comparably-priced hotels in same neighborhood.;3;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
5;8/12/2012;9m2Ei7twJOn5esfiE9dT9w;CLPut5UI0Hkq47y7czMK9Q;let us begin with the seven min wait for the one elevator.  we get to the room and the key card will not work.  the new one works after 4 or5 swipes.  the a/c works great after eight hrs.  if one person wishes to take a shower and the other a bath you are in luck because the tub does not drain.  also if you are not sure if you should be green and use only one towel, the tremont makes this easy! They only give you one towel per person.  I must say it really is in a great location and the people that work there are really nice, This place just needs lots of work.;1;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
6;2/17/2011;W6iFBr;JyqDfAiDbtASahLea4NFjA;Traveling on a budget is what brought me here. If I was not I would have been at the Sofitel or the Grad Hyatt. Location, location, location is the draw here. Located near North Michigan, and Rush is very convenient. Initially we had a queen and requested to upgrade to a Kind facing the front. They did this without any extra charge. Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God! This hotel has so much potential to redeem it's old world charm, but it seems like money may be tight.;2;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
7;7/26/2007;-tyvRLdz-vGKHAYm7xZHWw;N-FE0iEz4I1ymS4e1w23cA;As Martha would say, "What a dump!" Although not without its charm, the Tremont is old and with the apparent exception of the penthouse suite described below, not very well kept. The elevator creaks and makes thumping noises. My room smelled mildewy, the wallpaper was peeling, and the paint was chipped. The AC (which had an "on" setting and an "off" setting) pumped dusty air through a rusty vent surrounded by a corona of water stains in the ceiling. At 11:30 pm, I awoke to the sound of a door slamming over and over and over again. I staggered out into the hall to confront whatever ingrate was making the noise only to find that the elevator was stuck on the floor and the door was opening and slamming shut. During my three night stay, my key card magically deactivated four times. Don't be fooled by their website, which lists room amenities that you may find within. There is no room service, no in-room coffee pots, and when I asked about the promised in hotel "fitness center," the desk clerk said I could go to the Westin Hotel around the corner and, once they called the Tremont to verify my status as guest, use theirs. The TV in my room offered a dim, warped, off-color view of the five available channels. There are no window screens and a card on the desk cautioned that opening a window would lead to bugs, attracted by the lights, flying into the room. Because I am soft, I gave the place three stars because the employees are polite, helpful, and well-practiced in coping with angry guests. The lobby is also gorgeous and I had a pretty decent view of the Hancock out of my window. It is also cheap as hell for a hotel off Michigan Ave. Still, if you are looking for a hotel with more comfort and less character, and you can afford it, stay somewhere else.;3;3;0;1;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
8;10/26/2009;w;rIhwHyWLy4iyXOaqyqjJsw;My mom stayed here 4 or 5 years ago and loved its quaint charm, so when she met me in Chicago at the tail end of a business trip, we were excited to find that Hotwire had placed us here. Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond "charming" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying. I am all for old, quaint, authentic and charming but this place has really let itself go. Get me some coffee in my god-damned room and some ice machines so I can keep my champagne cold and I'll stop bitching. Promise.;3;2;1;1;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
9;9/2/2008;-uMEl2i3W0eQfuvP9rd8Iw;XrFCag4AMW5qta9QXokWPA;Checked into  the room for the Cubs-Cardinals series in early August.  Found the rate online and my critieria was cheap so I guess I can't complain.  Location was great.  Steps from Michigan Ave and Rush St.  On the down side, as we were checking in, a woman at the front desk was asking how to make the tv work, because she could only get a couple channels.  "Oh...sorry...our cable is out until next week."  Yeah...right! That should have been the first sign that this long-in-the-tooth motel was going to be no-frills.  So, not only is the tv limited to local only snow-casts, but having imbibed on great Chicago chow, I soon discovered that the toilet takes about 10 minutes and 5 or 6 flushes to disappear the package.  Yucko! Still, with its proximity to just about everything, it was quite a bargain for 3 nights ($159 per).  Just would have appreciated a little love on the bill after the cable outage. Ditka's adjoining restaurant made it barable.;2;0;0;1;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
10;1/12/2011;2whcmxA8hAbwjWwdgHB;sxWNqtsfiBz-LdnMHUnbWA;This is a gem of a hotel just off the Magnificent Mile.  The rooms are nothing to get excited about, but the location and the staff make it great.  If you're looking for the typical big chain hotel room, this isn't it.  If you want a quaint hotel, with comfy beds, hot water, and clean sheets, this is perfect.  Great rates available just check the hotel sites for deals. Ditka's place is right next door for eats, and Starbucks is across the street...perfect!;4;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
11;8/3/2010;MHsVUNG7uZFy0SYmMuJQhQ;EKjpxH__JX8Y2dqhtcUksQ;In some aspects I have to agree with Sam from Indiana. But, I do have to say when we get away, SERVICE is a huge thing.  Zaiia at the front desk and the Bellman Tom were very nice to us through our whole entire visit. Valet Parking = $49/day with in and out privileges. (We walked or cabbed it everywhere) We too received this through Hotwire...;3;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
12;8/23/2011;v6donee7Zj7bw0BMChV0;rW-iz5OKzzp2WOHh-CC9uQ;cheap hotel for the location.. i paid under a 100 bucks a night (not including tax)... as for the hotel itself.. it's a bit dated.. however the bed is really comfortable.. towels are relatively soft too there's only 1 elevator available for customers.. however they will open up the service elevator if it's busy.. the wifi is free and pretty quick too..;3;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
13;2/20/2010;d4;uUVZJm9yxNl5FBsXbt4WBg;So get this yelpers....I had the WORSE flying experience this past October(09) from SFO to Ohare...I'll yelp that botchjob in a sec, but anywhoo, I called the hotel after landing and mentioned that I was just making sure all was well, due to EVERYTHING ELSE going wrong that day. And when I get to the Tremont, ya wanna know what happened? " You sounded so stressed out on the phone earlier we upgraded your room" Pimp. Nice. I didn't even know they had rooms that large..and they got Ditka's to take our order at closing, and the hotel delivered our food to our door.In fact they pretty much spoiled us our whole visit(they even played gatekeeper for an annoying relative of mine..we of course tipped them for it) I love these bitches.See you in october 2010!;4;1;0;1;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
14;11/2/2011;HCpYnyB5mjZfnoJgMwxsSQ;62xZjarWrKQC4tHnl6u7qQ;I agree that this place is pretty small, but in the city it's hard to find a place this cheap that isn't. The value is huge with this place. It's in a great place, standard high-er end rooms, and above all pretty quiet. We stayed Halloween weekend and had no issues with hearing people in the hallway/people hearing us. The crowd seemed to be mixed, some young some older so I was little worried about noise level, but nothing happened (which is more than I can say for some of my other hotel visits). I mostly interacted with the night guy. He was great. Really knew a lot about the hotel/area and he was very friendly- even went out of his way to find me a lighter :) The biggest downside was really just that they never asked if we needed more than one key, so at a few points in time I got locked out of the room and had to call someone to let me back in... but that was pretty minor :) Can't wait to stay again!;4;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
15;8/23/2010;IZt-AmAaoGcHRbkcYXvBKw;ZCRY4GLLTli8tZRPi1P7Cw;My fiance and I vacationed to Chicago for 5 days & 4 nights:he picked The Tremont. At first, I was confused on the hotel: do I like it or hate it? The lobby is old fashioned in the sense with beautifully decorated with wooden crown moldings and leather sofa's. The receptionist didn't acknowledge us when we entered or exited, however, they were very attentive when I needed something. (IE: I wanted more towels & i got them in less than 5 minutes). The room was average, but very clean. At first, I was annoyed at how different the room looked in comparison to the photos, but my fiance made me change my mind: were we there to stay in a room the whole day or were we in Chicago to sight see? He was right: who cares? The best part: it was cheap ($85 a night) and walking distance to SO MANY attractions: a block away from million mile, short walk to the beach/Lake Michigan, 2 blocks from the Chicago Trolley, short walk to several bars and restaurants, to name a few. They also allowed me to receive and send faxes for free! For the price other hotels were charging, I would definately recommend this place!;4;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
16;7/8/2011;SXtLZI2GLjJQO5in;uOFIY6vBBp7O6un8CLggTw;Realy small hotel but it's in a great location in downtown chicago. The rooms itself are pretty well maintained. The lobby is fairly nice. Elevators are small, I don't know if that's the theme they are going for, cozy.... The price isn't that expensive considering you are in downtown chicago. A decent room with an okay view ran me up about a little over a hundred a night, though It's all about location location location. I almost never saw the staff other than check in and check out, maybe that's a good thing... I'd come back again if I'm ever in chicago.;3;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
17;10/16/2010;mtc2scxRhoGYtMpoJmVxLg;CTGy7JQR4OxfhaslgOFJDQ;Paid $140 for a room on this past Thursday. It was a last resort after the Sofitel was booked up and most of my coworker were staying there so I needed to be close  bye. Boy did I get the shaft on this business trip. I normally stay at the Sofitel which is amazing but this hotel can't compare in any way except the location. The check bell hop was very nice but besides him, the staff was not very helpful and kind of rude. I was told nothing about the hotel when checking in. I was barely spoken too actually. The room looks ok when I walk in, it was clean but older looking. The nightmare came at 2:30 am when I heard the couple next door having a good time soo clearly I felt like they were in my room. The walls were soo thin and the doors had more than enough room on the bottom for sound to come through. At 5 am the same couple wakes me again as they are getting ready and leaving their room. I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up by the cleaning staff cleaning that room at 7 am and again it sounded like they were in my room. I will never stay here again.;2;2;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
18;12/4/2010;DQQ4Ravffg9e6tzZo56l5Q;M8Fre7R4ZGbc37Jv5V7TGA;Location is AWESOME. It's across the street from Water Tower. If I was doing a girls night out, I would stay here! Yeah, the room we got was small. But this is an experience! It's a beautiful, historic hotel! The room design is different...artistic, some of my friends loved it! Some-hated it!;3;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
19;6/9/2010;SVJQKL2rEwq-NI4wMerQfA;-jHGlXMIjg0IIf7JaLy7Lw;40 minutes to check in ... Drafty windows which made the room damp on a very rainy day and the heat is shut off in the summer (It was 57 last night) The sink stopper was broken, the shower backed up. The elevator makes you feel as if you are being buried alive (if it is working) otherwise, you get to use the service elevator from the kitchen. Which smells awful! All for 300 bucks a night! There was a convention in town and am sure prices were raised accordingly. It's like camping in Goldcoast! Here's the best part - I asked the front desk agent to call me a cab ... She walked me to the front door and whistled and walked back inside ...;1;1;0;6;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
20;2/9/2011;8KSyutXCkhDk5n;b7EcrOTzbhYrRyAUIE-4_A;We celebrated our one year anniversary by going downtown Chicago, getting a hotel room, and going to dinner and having drinks. This hotel was by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The room was cold one second, and than unbearably hot the next. Everything was extremely old, and out of date. The bathtub was very dirty, and the carpet in the room looked like it hasn't been shampooed in over a century. I've stayed at motels that were better than this. The one star that I gave to this hotel is for it's location.;1;1;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
21;10/5/2008;qTDIcsgfB-xEVQKLP2C5Ig;IVr-6HabdCoSwip5Q6hoDA;This hotel is OLD.  Peeling paint, slow creaky elevators, dirty/scuffed baseboards, and ancient light lamps, wallpaper, and decorations. In my room, the walls actually had pretty sizable holes in them under the headboard and desk.  The sheets were rough and I even felt the hard springs inside the mattress poking me a little as I tried to sleep. That said, the location is good (it's close to Michigan Ave and the Chicago Red Line stop), the price is cheap (even last minute), and housekeeping is phenomenal at keeping things immaculate, even if you don't leave your room until the afternoon. There was also free wifi, which improves pretty much any situation.;3;0;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
22;3/17/2010;AySmFIkqwe;g4yJ1xYAoG5Qxc4Gg-UU8g;Don't kid yourself, you're paying for location and not much else. Mind you, the staff was nice and attentive, but that's mostly because they know it's the only thing that they've got to cling to. The facilities are atrocious. "Quaint," or "charming," or "has character," would apply if the rooms were small but well maintained and attended to, which they aren't. The shower had barely warm water and backed up such that I had water about 4 inches deep by the end of my short, cold, shower. The images shown of the hotel are of the, admittedly, nice lobby and the penthouse suite. The actual room we stayed in? Comparable to the YMCA room I stayed in while on spring break in New Orleans during college. If it were anywhere else besides 1 block off of Michigan Ave., the phrase "seedy dive" would spring to mind. I really don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place, so I'll stop now. PS, we got it through Hotwire and they claimed it to be a 3 star "boutique." Crazy.;1;2;0;0;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
23;5/31/2012;LYQmaV4gPPIVBlyugK2AFw;5H_NApSf2H4tW20V47RoMw;Well..... I don't know where to begin.... Do I start with the room with no blinds.... or maybe that the TV didn't work... OH I know... the fact that the A/C didn't work!   A/C not working... We rented 2 rooms for 2 nights...135/night during NATO weekend, so we werent expecting a whole lot and thats exactly what we got. Only in 50% of the rooms the A/C worked. it would go on for about an hour and then just hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the rest of the night. We had corner rooms so there was plenty of light, 2 HUGE windows on 2 walls... the only problem was that 50% of the rooms didn't have freakin blinds!!!!! One of the walls faced West so, hello sun at 6:15am. Not a good thing when we were there for a bachelor party.   So being the lacrosse fan we are, we wanted to watch a little NCAA lax before heading out... only one problem, 50% of the 46 inch flat screens didn't work!   Couldnt find the " Free High Speed" WIFI. I will give credit where is it due... the bathroom was nice and large and the beds werent the worse I have slept on. The building was perfect placement for us.. close to Wrigleyville and Down Town. We brought all items to attention of the front desk... many a times it was "its my first day sorry" or "I'll look into it" with no result. When leaving we explained to them the issues again and we got "wow your rate was only 135/night we are charging 250/night for this weekend, you should feel pretty lucky" WTF who says that, fix the A/C!!!;2;2;0;0;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
24;4/5/2012;hP8DYJE13js2QgjtpPDrUQ;HcUELjJ3-krjLXvLqUdjBQ;I really liked the location and the building is super cute and rustic but that's about it as far as the positives go. Each and every single time my boyfriend and I left the room, we could not get back in using our keys. We know not to keep them near cell phones, etc. so something is amiss with their key/lock systems. It was quite annoying having to go all the way up our 4th floor room only to have to go back down to get another key, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm not exaggerating. Also, the furnace or whatever it was (sorry, I'm a FL girl so I have no idea what it's called)  seemed to work only when it wanted and it got extremely hot in the room at times. Each night we had to leave the the window open so the temperature was tolerable, but even opening the window didn't work very well.  After alerting the front desk to our issues, they simply shrugged it off and said it should be working. This place wasn't expensive, but I've stayed in equally inexpensive places and never had these issues.  I think I will pick somewhere else when staying in Lincoln Park.;2;1;0;0;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
25;12/23/2011;x8XmITKi3zUPj7H60ngneg;V2OQaeZvePoGkbZ-Uye6KA;The whole family stayed here for 4 nights this summer as we moved youngest sister into DePaul. The rooms were clean and well kept during our stay. The building is super old so there's some interesting character to the layouts. The lobby is comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast was standard warm continental. The desk staff was friendly and had maps available for us to take with us when we ventured out to explore. Met my expectations for a budget hotel, nothing stellar but no complaints. The best part obviously is the super convenient location: an easy walk from the train station, an easy walk to the park, zoo, lots of restaurants and shops.;3;1;0;0;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
26;4/19/2007;KaRrm2c9GGsUvf6y0XhK9w;Hj8XSXWjcvuz7dE7udjnvg;Oh man - where to start?  Well, I saw a funny review on Orbitz which expresses my sentiments perfectly, so here's an excerpt... "The Inn at Lincoln Park is located in one of Chicago's trendiest neighborhood and yet, the hotel itself does not live up to ...  its surroundings. The comforter on the bed looked old and a bit worn and perhaps it was the combination of humidity that made me not want to take my shoes off... Oh, and I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat without first covering it with toilet paper... When was the last time they cleaned that bathroom? On the plus side, I found the front desk staff to be very helpful and genuinely concerned about my comfort. It's in an EXCELLENT location and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. With that in mind, one night was enough for me." So in summary: Pros: * location - lots of shops and food (the walgreens on the corner is closed right now though) * pleasant staff - very accommodating and helpful in my experience Cons: * the rooms - small, uncomfortable, and not clean I don't like to be too negative, so will leave it at that.  Keep in mind that you're paying half or a third of the cost of a nice hotel, so you get what you pay for.  If you've stayed in hostels through europe in your youth and can still stand it, this place is fine.  So I'd say this is the right place if all you care about is having a bed to sleep on and would spend as little time as possible inside the room.  I never realized I had become a hotel snob until I stayed here, so the Inn at Lincoln Park will always have a place in my heart.  Somewhere in the back/bottom...;1;0;0;1;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
27;6/6/2011;y0Q;TYSR6svM9HQoqgBUpQH7GQ;I joined Yelp tonight specifically to warn people away from this place.  I arrived at 10:30 in the evening, and by the time I was in the room for 30 minutes I had already made reservations at another place:15 minutes later I was already walking to the new place with my bags.  I simply could not stay there.  Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, mystery stains on the carpet, a truly frightening bedspread, ripped chair cushions, scratched-up upholstery, and a general sense of uncleanliness:but the clincher was the security chain, which had clearly been broken in numerous times before, given the EIGHT bruised nail holes clustered around it. They did offer to upgrade me, but I simply had to leave.  I am not a hotel snob, but that room just felt like a dirty motel at a truck stop.  If it was $40 / night [in this neighborhood], I could see it.  But over $100 / night?!?!  No f-ing way.  I went to the Day's Inn one block away for $13 / night cheaper...   I hate to be so negative, but they need to know they need to upgrade their facility:in the meantime, I can take some solace from helping others avoid the disappointment I felt.;1;1;0;1;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
28;3/17/2009;PMc5MEKcHAiZmBv6Mb1;vvB_c7yYIA1bnjgb3aPckg;My wife and I stayed here on St. Pats weekend 2009.  The lobby area is nice but I started to get a feeling of doom as we went through the hallway and stepped in the tiny elevator.  I said to my wife, this hotel is small but quaint. Our room was exactly that, small but quaint.  I wasn't expecting huge or modern.  I was expecting current tech with nostalgia.  Our room was fitted with a CRT tv (old style SD tv)  and a small fridge (unstocked).  We had a radiator for heat, purple tile in the bathroom and an old tub with a shower curtain.   The location is excellent for exploring the Wrigleyville area.  Bus 22 will take you up and down Clark for $2 a trip.  (don't be scared of the bus). The Inn offered a nice breakfast included with the fare.  I thought the bed was comfortable and the room temp was fine.  I opened the window before going to sleep, but had to close it by 1AM due to the street noise. The price is a little high for the location, but in a pinch you will not be disappointed.  I will not be back unless the area is booked.;3;1;0;0;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
29;5/19/2008;I0vGGN0LprM-tMglZndWPg;o-t-i7nbT5N_cmkCXs5oDQ;I stayed here on my last visit to Chicago... all hotels were booked that weekend, so that was the last resort and my expectations were low. I paid much more than I should have for a place like this one (almost $200 a night), but I think their regular rates are quite a bit cheaper if you book your room in advance. This said, the hotel was actually not bad. It's nothing fancy: very similar to your average Days Inn or Best Western, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean. We even got a free upgrade (larger room). They have free breakfast (kind of crappy, but it's free...), and there is discounted parking at the hotel: $12, which is very cheap by Chicago standards. So... I'd have no problem staying there again, provided I can get a cheaper rate. 3-1/2 stars.;3;4;4;0;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg

Yes, clean sheets, but the beds feel like they are from the Salvation Army. The shower barely had hot water. Service is TERRIBLE. I had to walk down to the "lobby" to get an iron. And it's not like I got a discount. This place was not cheap the weekend I was there. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I WILL NEVER GO BACK.;1;0;0;1;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
32;9/14/2009;APt0YJ5VaetNdy58vfe4aQ;j_4_xCD3_VK18h_rKbvcbg;If you like a hotel that you spend almost $200 to be comfortable DO NOT STAY HERE! Just stayed for one night Sept. 11. Most of the hotels in town were booked and we thought for $200 and discovering a new neighborhood for us in Lincoln par would be fun. I have never dreaded going back to a hotel to sleep for the night. Yes it's old, but apparently that also means dumpy. Postage stamp for an elevator, narrow dark hallways, and dark old rooms with an old TV and an outdated bathroom that really needs some bleach! Our room was a smoking (tried to save $10) and boy did it stink! Our air conditioner didn't actually cool very well, and made a funny noise ALL night. The only thing I felt was clean were the sheets and I was still thinking about the possibility of bed bugs.  The staff were not friendly, saw them give attitude to another guest who did not want to stay once he actually saw the rooms. Next time, stay at the Club Quarters in the loop for the same price.;1;0;0;2;2nnXespKBBNtDQTtrumNFg
33;7/30/2012;i0s7nvIPJMQ3jNhiagRG;6UkBaNfSwL0kDyopx7agUg;Aside from the slow elevators and slow internet  I enjoyed my stay here even though it was under crappy circumstances (displaced by fire in my apartment building). Luckily the owner of my apartment building (right up the street) owns this hotel so we got a free room for two nights and a few other perks I wont mention. I was surprised to find a room with two sinks in the bathroom and a small room with a fridge, microwave, sink and a coffee maker. The bathroom was better than the bathroom in my apartment and not at all with a generic hotel look. If I ever move away from Oak Park and come back needing a hotel, this is the place I will stay!;4;1;1;1;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
34;7/30/2012;LhYG1EJ6gahWUnEf6Gp0GQ;2EKOXmF_sk1G0bAajWiINg;Stayed in the motel part of the hotel, but attended a marriage ceremony and reception in the main building. The motel is a real throwback, with multiple versions of patterned wallpaper, bright colored bedspreads, and drapes all mixed in with a combination of carpet and contrasting tile. It's a good thing I could give a s**t about decorating. The bed was comfortable and clean, and overall, the place is very nicely kept. Bathroom is tight for two (really, it's tight for one), but a nice, hot shower. The accommodations for the marriage ceremony and reception were top notch, and everything from the bartenders to the hors d'ouevres were excellent. And the dinner was incredible -- not sure I've ever seen a kitchen send out this much food -- and complicated food (beef wellington), no less -- and have it come out hot, crispy and delicious. Kudos to all for being spot on! TIP: Don't forget to ask for the WiFi password when checking in -- and the WiFi password expires in the middle of the night, so don't waste too much time trying to figure out why your network connection is gone in the morning...;4;0;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
35;7/9/2012;KlIz9J4nWMUfV4AsfM1SfQ;AXcoaTwCYc-yPadcERSesg;I'd love to give this 2.5 stars if I could. I decided to come here because the overall reviews looked good and the price was great. (I was there for business, didn't want to stay at the airport and downtown Chicago didn't make sense) Its true it looks recently renovated, the lobby area is pretty ritzy looking, and the restaurant seemed to have a lot of business. I stayed in the motor inn section. The sheets & towels were worn & tired. The place just didn't look sparkling. There was a towel in the bathroom hung like maybe the maid had not seen it from the last guest. The tile was a bit scuffed. The bathroom could have used a fan, a new door, and a light in the shower. This will do since this is a business trip, but I kind of wish I were somewhere else... http://www.carletonhotel…;2;0;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

It had allot of + the price was under 100 bucks, was on a single floor close to the parking. The room was small but the decoration was very nice kind of 60's inspired. The town was within walking distance. Oak Park has allot of shops. (we went on the 4th almost all were closed that day). The green line train was a block away if you want to go downtown. Take a visit to the Frank Lloyd Wright former home and walk or drive to the dozen or so homes he built very cool.;5;0;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
37;6/4/2012;p1DWWHJdkbJYrN21MKCR7g;Fl_Zw9B2Nt4YKXW1ve0h4A;Remember in Home Alone, that concierge at the hotel who was a total crab and wanted to bust Macaulay Culkin's ass? I think his dopplegangler works the front desk at Carleton. We had a group # for our wedding guests, but somehow a handful of their reservations disappeared. Maybe it was user error or maybe it wasn't, but when working in a hotel, you need to just drop the 'tude and satisfy your paying customers. You don't act like you're doing us a favor by letting us stay at your crusty hotel. Anyhow, besides all that drama, the hotel was fine. The cleaning ladies I ran into were super sweet. The rooms were clean and spacious. Their choice of fabric patterns for the curtains were unfortunate. The entrance was really weird. What hotel doesn't have automatic doors? Getting your stuff into the hotel is like an obstacle course. First you push through two sets of doors (no button for handicapped people to access), then you have some steps to make it through. To get to the right wing, you have to go up some more steps before making it to an elevator. Someone didn't think this through very well.;3;0;0;1;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

It reminds me of one of those places that are trying to hard to be something that they will never be. We went here for brunch. The food was luke warm and not too tasty. The guy that they had fixing the omeletts didn't understand English (what part of the plan was that ? ) the server came only 1 time to bring us drinks and of course due to mothers day brunch, the Tip Added to her ticket was a whopping 20% gratuity when we didn't see her. For almost $200 for 4.. one 12 yrs of age..I think I will do as I always do, spend a little more and head to the Ritz Carlton or the Drake hotel..;1;0;1;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
39;5/13/2012;Oy5g3Dg2UOY46W0uV-39xQ;WFfMbs9iXsYZT9GHfVCLTA;We picked this hotel for a weekend away from the city because we thought Oak Park would be a nice place to unwind. The lobby had an old-world charm that lent the hotel a boutique feel. We splurged on a hot tub suite, and the tub was indeed the highlight of the experience. The bathroom was huge and seems to have been recently remodeled. The rest of the suite was immaculate, the front desk staff attentive, and the wi-fi as high-speed as advertised. For those that might be directionally-challenged, this hotel is off the beaten path and a bit difficult to locate. It is within walking distance from downtown Oak Park, though, so it is very convenient for those who would prefer to leave their car and spend the weekend on foot. I think the Carleton would benefit from the services of an interior decorator for the rooms. Much of the furniture seemed very traditional mid-price hotel style and boring. Not nearly as classy as the lobby might suggest. That was a bit disappointing. We did enjoy our stay, though the hotel was not amazing enough for us to feel an urgent need to book a second stay.;3;0;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
40;10/16/2011;9X8POHr-99s5xnKx8UDLsA;UqYndXp9pbFpapebnIleTw;We picked this spot because it is the closest hotel to Forest Park.  We paid amost $200 a night and we did get a suite.  The suite was very large- but needs serious updating.  The carpets were gross, the wall paper was coming loose, the furnture looked like it had been in a Frat house.  Needless to say, the only reason we have chosen this place for a second time is due to it's location. I decided to ask the front desk manager if there were any remodels in the works.  She did explain that all of the rooms have been or are in the process of being re-modeled.  She also said that the suites were the last one scheduled for re-model.  So, my suggestion would be to make sure you request a re-modeled room.;3;2;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
41;6/28/2011;obHu0dLxXe1LzsidHz89ag;Ztd3ZxcPSCXv01MZTBXVZQ;I was born and raised in Oak Park, and my dad still lives there, so I had actually never been inside the Carleton until I booked a block of rooms there for out-of-town guests that attended my wedding in June of 2011. The Carleton is pretty sweet! It is old-fashioned without being run down. Our guests enjoyed staying there.  It's in a nice part of Oak Park, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby (as well as the Harlem Green Line and Metra stops- easy access to Chicago). I liked the variety of rooms (and prices) that were available for our guests to book.  My husband and I booked the hot tub suite for two nights before and after our wedding.  The hot tub was really nice and the room was perfect for all of the hair and makeup needs of my bridal party. The front desk staff was so nice and accommodating of us and all of our guests.  Everyone recognized me as "the bride" and was especially considerate of my needs throughout the weekend.  Their customer service made me feel special and very taken care of. We definitely brought the party back to Poor Phil's on Saturday following the wedding, and all of our guests had a blast.  Thank you to the Carleton for putting up with us. We had a great experience there during our wedding weekend, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Oak Park!;5;0;1;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

43;12/22/2006;2GDqhEzpMAWa9iMOMXpiYQ;0vdXVH2HlQUxE9FFFIE5DA;I stayed at the Motor Inn section for one night prior to an interview. Staff was very helpful, prompt, and had a good sense of humor.  There are two parts to the hotel - The Carleton and the Motor Inn sections.  The Motor Inn section was very old timey hotel and reminded me of the ones i've stayed in in northern Wisconsin. I could not find the thermostat in the room but that may be because I'm an idiot... the room was a comfortable temperature anyway so it didn't matter to me. Internet is free but for some reason it didn't work at all.  I had to use the internet at an attached restaurant (also free).  I couldn't pull up directions the next day because they were both down and it was really frustrating. I don't really know what else to say about the place.  There was a big bed, a TV with cable (thank you espnews!) to keep me company.  There was enough soap that I could have showered 183 times and not made a dent in it.  Very spacious room.  Parking was easy (I came back after 11pm and still had a spot).;3;4;0;1;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
44;10/22/2007;OtImC9WxbQJb7IIhf;wiFeLz74XNt7Z8NnfxDzWQ;Beautiful ballroom and bar area. Great ambiance. We had about 65 people at our wedding reception and suprisingly the ballroom wasn't too big, however, since the bar area is down a little corridor, people pretty much ventured to the bar to drink and lounge after dinner/dancing. It was intimate, people we're able to meet and talk.  Since we had a small party, everyone could fit comfortably into the large bar area. The food was from Philanders and it was awesome across the board- the fav main dish was the beef and tilapia. YUMMY! We received a complimentary room which worked out well, we used it as our home base. It was close to the reception area and was very well kept with a old fashioned flair. I'm very happy with how the reception turned out, I think the hotel is great for smaller weddings and is a wonderful place if you want to get away from the typical Holiday Inn reception. Our course it comes with a price tag, but it was worth it! One more side note for wheelchair users: I was concerned since a couple of the guests are wheelchair-bound and the hotel reception area is actually on a couple levels. The hotel isn't accessible with ramps throughout, but they have lifts throughout to accomodate even larger electric wheelchairs. I was surprised the lifts were insulated very well because you couldn't hear the noise in the ballroom.;5;1;1;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w
45;5/30/2011;DJ8jYzGMz-yot5jGKTAqoQ;iJ6X8pk9ijq07TuzLZEuvA;I'm surprised to see a review of the motor lodge that says the rooms have an "old but clean look". I'm not sure if the rooms have been redone recently or not, or if the motor lodge that others have reviewed is a totally different section. From my understanding, however, my friend did stay in the motor inn section. The room was pretty modern, with a flat screen TV, kitchenette, and a pretty nice bathroom when compared with your average motel-type rooms. We were both believing he would be staying in the main hotel, yet were both somewhat impressed by the room, which he described as "artsy". For the price, the room was great. I'm not sure if his price was lower because he placed his reservation online or not, but it was a pretty sweet deal. The room had two beds, a table with four chairs, a flat panel TV, a kitchenette with coffee maker and comp coffee, dishes, silverware, microwave, mini frig, and cabinets. The room had a little hallway which led to both the closet and bathroom. There's no dresser in the room, but a wall with drawers in the back of this little hall. The closet has more than ample space, plus two extra pillows, two extra blankets, iron, full sized ironing board, an extra roll of toilet tissue, and plenty of towels is the bathroom. The only "bad" thing was that I saw no ice machine anywhere. There was however a soda machine outside. The beds were fairly comfortable as far as motel beds go, and he had no problems with anything in the room, aside from the wifi being slow. Everything worked, the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and everything was just great. I've stayed in a few motels, as well has motels pretending to be hotels, and this is by far my favorite. The next time I want to just get away for the weekend, it's nice to know that I don't have to leave the state or even Oak Park, to find a nice, relaxing hotel at a fair price for a night or two.;5;2;1;1;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

49;11/16/2009;ct5eh6OBQzQgjzyUQFI3Vw;g5VBYCkNl3arsRpIuNxpUQ;The location met our needs, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  However, there were certain negative aspects that could not be fixed by a simple call to the front desk.  At this price point, you do not get what you pay for.  If we're simply talking about the quality of the rooms, I would say $75/night, $80 tops.  Certainly not $188.   Overall, the biggest concerns were the rooms' smell, and the rooms' cleanliness.  Even though it is a non-smoking hotel, the first room I was given was stuffy and smelled of smoke.  It reminded me of an old room in a B&B that is rarely used.  I get the impression that lots of weddings happen at this hotel, so I think people party in the rooms, and staff does not necessarily enforce the non-smoking policy.  One of the restaurants in the lobby is fairly new, and management did not adequately consider how the hotel's layout and air flow (or lack thereof) might let the smell of the restaurant linger in the elevators and the hallways of the upper floors.  There is radiator heat in the rooms, which is fine.  There are also wall air conditioner units, but there are no instructions- just a remote- and it took some time to dicifer.   The rooms just look dingey. The comforters are pilling due to wear,  blankets old.  The pillows had yellow stains.  Furnishings look somewhat grungey on the surface, as though they haven't been wiped down properly.  The wallpaper and sofa had white stains.  The bathroom had mildew.   When the first room I had smelled of smoke (I have a severe smoke allergy), to the hotel's credit, I was (very nicely) given a second room without question.  While the smell of smoke in the second room was less, the room was no cleaner.  Both rooms hadn't been vacuumed well, and there was grit and dirt in the carpet.   In addition, a previous guest had spilled coffee grounds in one area, and no one had cleaned it up. I understand that due to the age of the building, that most funds must be put into the exterior, and keeping it up to code.  That being, said, for the money you are paying, I think the owners should seriously consider addressing some of these problems.;2;3;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

Annie, the banquet manager, is organized, professional, and always quick to respond to any emails or questions. I found their policies regarding weddings much more flexible than other places.  The hotel itself is beautiful and provides an entire section for your wedding, including a gorgeous bar area with sitting rooms for cocktail hour.   The ballroom is a smaller and more intimate than many hotel ballrooms which I preferred for our 100 person wedding.  In addition, the prices and catering minimums are much more reasonable than any place I looked at in Chicago.   The food is catered by Barclays located in the hotel and was delicious, and we received many compliments on it and the hotel as a whole.;5;0;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

The hotel in on Wabash and Erie, two blocks from Michigan Avenue (known for shopping) and the CTA Redline. The hotel is around a busy and safe area. I walked around the area at 11pm at night and I had no issues. There were not a lot of people out at night but I felt safer than other parts of Chicago I visited during the daytime (southside of chicago). They have a friendly front desk who will answer your questions and accomodate your needs (extra soap, problems with the room). The rooms are small but that is fine because when you visit chicago, you are only at your hotel to sleep for a few hours. The bathroom is about the size of your room. They have FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had eggs with cheese, sausages, make your own pancakes, cereal, fruit and etc. Hot coffee and teas as well as ice cold water were always available throughout the day. They have a nice, clean, big dining room by the lobby. I like the hotel. The only problem is the ventiliation kept making a sound at night and kept waking me up. I asked the hotel staff to fix it two nights in a row. It stopped for a few hours and the sound came back again. I would definitely go back to this hotel again as it is convenient and not too expensive.;3;0;0;0;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A

Cheapest place I found that was 3 stars, no bed bug reports (as of Jan '12 - no bug reports is always something I check now with travelling!) and near Magnificent Mile, so it was excellent.  Expected smaller but upon getting to the room, I was happy. totally enough room to move around. A cute lil mini-sofa seat in the corner. Chic wallpaper in the bathroom. Not a place you'd come to for luxury or for the style, it's draw is that it covers the basics and has lil contemporary charm touches (love the chicken photos in the foyer)..Friendly front desk. The doors are pretty industrial looking metal and closet appears to be a janitor's closet before opening, but whatever, there's hangers and a small safe and that meets the needs. You can see some ppl also reviewed under Hotel Cass (formerly)  - http://www.yelp.com/biz/…. Happy face =] because: - Low price - Adequate enough size for basic needs - Great location - Free internet wifi, and decent speed - 2 comps in the business ctr with free printing - Free breakfast (not perfect but free is key - and  Trader Joes and Jewel Osco are nearby to cover more options). Bfast is like 6-930, so I had to force myself awake to get it, but glad it was there. - Clean enough (a couple markings on the slightly dusty curtains and I think some stain on the wallpaper, but oh well) - My bf was happy that the flat screen TV had HBO - Good view outside the room to see the tops of some churches Improvements would be: - I wish there was a mini fridge (it was 23 degrees when I visited, so I put water near the window and that worked OK). - I wish there was a microwave (tho there is one downstairs in the breakfast room - I wish there was a luggage rack (eh,I put luggage on the sofa) - Not much bathroom counter space (I just cleared the towels off the top towel rack to put a few things there or I could have brought the mini white table over next to the door if needed) - Thicker walls (one night was quiet, the next morn had neighbor moans - ah well, it's just one of those amusing touches when you stay at a hotel haha) I would def stay again and recommend to others.;4;2;0;0;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A

Short walk to CTA red line and within walking distance to many fun bars, restaurants, shops, and the lakefront. There were a few small problems: our intial room lacked air conditioning, so we were transferred to a second floor room that was probably arranged for handicapped persons so there was an open shower, no fan, etc. I am sure the free breakfast was great, bit we never awoke early enough to enjoy it!

Nothing here was better than any other similarly priced hotel, no in room fridge and tiny rooms would have already dragged this to a 3.  Staph infection and no communication makes it a 1.;1;0;0;0;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A
59;6/27/2012;IuiFj0B4a1bQHhcI-0s2Tw;G2hOfzXQFNkHm-xsItPd8g;This was my very first trip away from home with my two-year-old son.  The pictures online, convenient location and cheaper price if you book in advance were all positives even before we arrived.  We had a rough taxi ride from the airport, and just upon arrival, my son vomited in the taxi....not the best start to our trip.  The gentleman at the front desk (I think his name was Todd) was sympathetic and very kind.  We were hours early for check-in, but were able to take advantage of the lobby and breakfast, and we cleaned up the best we could in the lobby washroom.  Todd and another woman at the front desk were helpful with directions to nearby attractions.  Our room was ready after a few hours exploring the city, which worked out nicely (still earlier than check in time).  The room  was exactly as pictured on the website.  Small, but not too small (still had a dresser inside the closet and closet space), updated, modern and very clean.  As a mother, these were all very important to me.  Wi-fi was free, which was appreciated.  We had a very pleasant stay and enjoyed breakfast everyday.  Some days it was very busy, but we were lucky enough to have a table each day.  The staff (including breakfast staff) was incredibly friendly and courteous!  That alone would bring us back for another stay.  Todd remembered my name after our first encounter and every doorman would greet my son and me enthusiastically every time!  There are a few steps at the entrance from the front door to the hotel lobby, which worried me with an enormous suitcase and a stroller, but the doorman would help us every single time.   They held our luggage both the day we arrived and the day we left, which was a relief.  There is a Trader Joe's practically right across the street, and restaurants, Magnificent Mile shopping and Water Tower shopping all within walking distance.  Navy Pier is a longer walk, but manageable.  I liked that the hotel seemed smaller and personal, was updated and still was an historical building.  We would absolutely stay here again!  I am grateful for such a positive traveling experience!;4;0;0;0;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A
60;5/7/2011;7LAQJoV-kCaXPcAAf4iDSQ;xq8MehjzMhUEl33Eun4OCw;Holiday Inn Express is an affordable good enough hotel. I found a deal online and booked this hotel for around $75 a night which is pretty cheap for downtown Chicago. The lobby and the common area are nice. The room is VERY small, but it has a comfortable bed. For me, when you're in downtown Chicago, you're not going to spend a lot of time in your room anyway. They have free wifi which is nice. Their free hot breakfast was also decent too. The rooms are nothing to brag about, but the location and price give this property a 4 star.;4;0;0;0;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A
61;2/18/2011;q7qDIWjrtOsdid7tO8qMoQ;JXLeXRqu0XbHLZmZL755nw;Stayed here via Hotwire for $79 on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9pm and the staff at the front desk was extremely rude. The redheaded woman that checked us in never made eye contact once and didn't bother listening to us either. We were given a room on the 2nd floor at the end of the hall.The rooms are very small and the hallways are equally as small. Our room faced Wabash so there wasn't much we could do about the noise. I would hope higher floors didn't have as much of an issue with noise. Upon checkout the in-room service was not functioning. We called the front desk and the staff was just as rude as the evening staff and abrubtly hung up on us. The only saving grace to the hotel was the breakfast in the morning. All in all - we got what we paid for with a location we wanted. NOTE: Parking at the hotel is $40 valet, you can go around the corner and use public parking for $34 for overnight.;1;2;0;1;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A

Had we brought our baby, however, we would not even have had enough floor space to set up a pack and play. Starbucks and Trader Joes are across the street.

63;10/17/2011;No7qd7cFZyckjl7BD9Br6Q;ohsL6aKdwcRjc7Wc6Wloog;Perfect place to stay in downtown Chicago. Just stayed here for 3 nights this past weekend and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Being my first time ever staying in a Holiday Inn, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but we were greeted with genuinely friendly staff who were more than happy to hold our luggage (we arrived earlier than check in time) and suggest things for us to do and places to eat while we waited for our room to be cleaned. Free hot breakfast in the morning was better than the usual continental breakfast they offer at other hotels..complete with cereal, eggs filled with cheese, pancakes, bagels, sausage, muffins, biscuits, assorted juices, and hot cinnamon rolls (although we didn't take advantage of this every morning since Chicago has so many yummy breakfast spots). Staff were always available to hail cabs for us. One guy even went down the block to flag one down! Extra tip for him of course. Hotel is walking distance to some nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. If you get the GO Chicago card, the greyline will pick you up a few blocks from the hotel so you can save money on transportation there. Only complaints: small hallways and small rooms! Super cramped. But I guess for the location and price, you can't really expect much more.;4;1;0;0;XZEBxlz9ZoP76CrYvEsL1A
64;8/7/2012;FTRQPmFEKAhxMsAfI6h-Kw;Npp8jQmV8sWTjCmBouz-zQ;I stayed here with friends for a concert for two nights and have to say for the price, location and quality, the Whitehall Hotel is tough to beat! It markets itself as boutique hotel and it is indeed just that, so you can expect great 1:1 service but it's not going to be a systematic as your neighborhood Hilton. Maybe it's because I live in NY, but the room were much bigger than I anticipated and we had a great view of Chicago's Gold Coast. The beds were insanely comfortable and I found the bathroom to be clean (and also spacious). As I had last been to Chicago when I was a kid, I wasn't too familiar with what to do but found everyone at the front desk and concierge to be very helpful in recommending places to go visit/eat. I was initially unsure on how near/far the hotel was relative to other things in Chicago but quickly found its location to be very ideal. It's right off Michigan Ave so you have all the shopping/Maginificent Mile right there and only a few blocks away from the water. In fact, the only time we used a cab was to get to/from the airport and then coming back from going out at night. They do not have an ice machine on each floor so you have to call the front desk to order some which is fine with me but when we did call, we had to do so twice before it finally came up. A light bulb was out in our room and we also had to call twice before someone came. I am not sure if getting to the ice machine/mechanic just took that much time but that was only some significant "complaint" I had. Also, the TV was severaly outdated (think late 90's) and was angled to the left of our bed (opposed to in front) which was a little strange. Overall, an excellent hotel - highly recommend.;4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
65;7/9/2012;rUCb;UvN5nsb99EG-0rhNkY0gpw;For the price I have to give a solid three stars. The place was under construction and the air conditioning was off in the lobby for the three days I was there. they could have made arrangements considering the temperature was over 95 and humid every day. Also, the doormen were very inconsistent, usually hanging out at the curb chatting up the valet attendant. The rooms were nice and clean, beds comfortable and the aire in the room blew ice cold. All in all, I would stay here again as long as I was able to get the reduced rate with AMEX. If you are looking for a hotel with dining, this place has a restaurant but it remained empty my whole stay. (But hey, this is Chicago and I am sure no one wants to eat at a hotel restaurant unless it is associated with a kick ass chef!);3;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
66;5/22/2012;6xKC1ZHMYPzz4hcLPKwaTw;M2HVnROM7q4KozDFMVrEFQ;I stayed at the Whitehall hotel in April and overall had a great experience. The hotel itself is old and even though it went through a renovation not to long ago, it still felt old. The beds and rooms were very spacious and comfortable, but the elevators were very cozy (maximum 5 people, 4 with luggage). The staff are extremely nice, and has a small, but clean entrance/lobby. LOCATION: FANTASTIC! In the heart of the magnificent mile and never really needed a taxi!

69;4/5/2009;MJf3ktc5Q;aD-rsDe2S0e7jTkYD6ULaQ;Historic building with great employees, stellar location, and hard to beat price. 3.75 stars Cost to worth it ratio: 5 (we got this room for an average of ~$130/night including taxes! Four Seasons a few steps away goes for quadruple that.) Highlights: - Location: half a block from the famous Michigan Ave, across the street from Bloomingdale's on one side and the Hancock Tower on the other. Walking distance to most everything and short cab ride to Lincoln Park area. - Service: fantastic. After being checked in, they called a few minutes after we got settled to check how everything was. When we had to take the service elevator, we didn't complain but they apologized and let us take the hotel town car to dinner on them. :-) - Amenities: gym, 24 hr room service, restaurant/bar, wine shop, and mini bar. - Historic: building's been around forever--they have a 3 page story of it in the hotel's info binder. Midlights: - Atmosphere: rooms and lobby isn't anything special, but they're fine. Lowlights: - Only had 2 queen bed room when we checked in - 1 of 2 elevators they had was out the whole time. There are several floors, so that slowed things down quite a bit at times. On the place alone I might not be too impressed, but the price, service and location bumps it up a few notches so I'd consider staying here again.;4;4;2;1;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
70;3/20/2011;KqgFaY4wdWGBKFTmwv-j9Q;8_fAttH_yKopBDrT_2ugHA;Famous stars such as John Travolta, Katharine Hepburn, and a few select others (which they pride themselves on serving once or twice:the full list can be found outside the building and inside near the check-in station) have chosen this hotel to stay at, and I get it. It's quaint, it's timely--it looks right out of what 1970's luxury class hotel should look like. We stayed on the 16th floor and had a nice view of a construction site, the Hancock building, and the American Girl doll shop. But for some reason, I can't get too into this place. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it lacked a decent screen on the 16th floor windows, paying $10/day for internet access (when I've had it free at plenty of others), the creepily trembling elevators, or that the staff were rude, but I just can't give this place five stars. However, despite those short comings, it was incredibly clean, the hotel is in a safe part of town, the beds are comfortable, and the drinks at the downstairs bar were fantastic. There are certainly good things to this place, and the $150/night (when it could probably and easily be much more in this town) wasn't bad either. The one thing I would like to know is, why were there three phones in our room? And one in the bathroom, nonetheless?;3;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
71;1/19/2010;9liM98kn45ytzBpzuzKHhQ;m7iiJlloCRfWaCPwQwTmpg;Once you step out of the hotel to the right, you can see the John Hancock tower looming over you. Nice! The staff is professional and accommodating. They allowed me to switch my room from a 1 queen bedroom to a 2 queen with no hassles. The room was spacious and clean.The bed was very comfortable for me especially after I ran a marathon. My only issue was this dark brown fur coat thing on bed that was used for decoration. I certainly hope that it was not real animal fur. I quickly threw that off to the side. The hotel is across the street from the Four Seasons. Save your money and come here instead. This spot is cheap compared to other hotels because of its location. At the time I went there (October 2009), they were still renovating, which wasn't an issue for me. No free internet here and you pay $10 a day. I didn't realize this until my last day that they offer free wireless in the main parlor room in the lobby.

72;1/6/2010;u;Jw4OHr6HibJeEIMfAxc1_Q;A decent location that I managed to book for a cheap price (~$110 per night).  We checked in early, which the concierge was ok with it.  We had some glitches with getting our room (from broken door to non-functional heating), but the staff was professional about it that we ended up in a room on the 15th floor with 2 king-sized beds (when we started with a 3rd floor room with 2 queen-sized beds). The hotel is under some renovation, so there were plastic sheets on the ground of every floor.  It wasn't a big deal to me. Overall, for the price and the location, I was quite satisfied with the quality of the room and the staff.  Would definitely consider this hotel again when I visit Chicago next.;4;2;2;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
73;5/18/2009;k7Wmf02MVGo2dmFp4l9bdg;4yiybZtqOAOkwO98rGSnUw;I'm going to start this review by saying that I really do despise boutique hotels. To think that for almost the same money I could stay at the Westin or Four Seasons and have all the ammenities I desire makes me wonder why I ever stay in boutique places at all. I don't care what anybody says, boutique means old. This boutique experience was a work necessity. They picked the hotel. It actually wasn't that bad. The staff when I got there was friendly. The staff when I left was friendly. I was the staff in the middle I didn't really appreciate. I also didn't appreciate the ancient elevator or the fact that I did end up in a lovely penthouse with a view only to wake up in the morning and realize the shower didn't work. After five calls to the front desk asking for a maintenance person to come up they sent the bellman instead to move my bags to another room. ??????? OK.... Anyway, when he moved me had he had the nerve to ask if I'd pulled the knob out! Of course I did! I'm not a freakin idiot. I do shower regularly. And in my showering career, I've definitely used a few different types of faucet. I've got it covered, I think. The bed at this place was actually really comfortable though and the mini bar was well stocked. This spot is walking distance to the best shopping in Chicago and also some great eats. I really enjoyed the close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Viagra Triangle.   The rooms were clean and well appointed. It was also nice to have the bar downstairs even if they did have last call at 11:30.;3;1;1;2;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
74;3/30/2011;o2AUrAS0;mMKqLoG1lq70pa0HE666Ig;I live in the suburbs and my BF and I were going to the city for a night on the town and decided to get a room for the evening so we didn't have to worry about driving back.  We looked at a few options and the location and price were the big selling points.  We have stayed at The Hilton and Hard Rock and the Whitehall was about 30% less.  We booked about 3 days in advance and it was about $150 for the night.  The hallways were narrow and the front lobby and elevators were realitivly small.  I already had the prenotation the rooms were going to be tiny, but to my suprise the rooms were really spacious!  Super comfy bed with a bear skin blaket throw. The room was bigger than The Hard Rock and the Hilton.  There wasnt a fridge but most hotels downtown dont have refrigerators. The location was su-purb! It was about a 2 block walk to the red line.  We partied that evening in Lincoln Park  and it was about a $12 cab ride back to the hotel.;4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
75;2/14/2010;50H;tHY6fy5NwFgcxq54iA446Q;The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are clean.  However, the service is horrendous and they slyly charge an extra  $100 "standard incidental fee" at check out.  The fee isn't listed on the final bill you sign, so it's a hidden fee that in this day seems a$$ backwards.  So be forewarned that while you may have only authorized x amount, you'll see a charge on your account for x + $100 instead.  Completely aggravating.         The hotel is still under renovation and has plastic covering the hallways, so it's a little dingy.  The rooms are quiet, the bed is actually really comfy, and if you're a hobbit who enjoys waking up to frigid water in the dead of Winter you'll love the shower height and water temp.  There isn't a coffee maker or fridge in the room, so plan on running to a cafe for your morning fix and don't bother with leftovers if you eat out.  We mistakenly ordered a pot of coffee the 1st morning and had to wait 40 minutes for it to show up.  Also, skip Fornetto Mei downstairs--we stopped in for drinks before dinner and waited 20 minutes before leaving because no one took our order :( Forget about staying here when there are so many other better options where you will actually get basic hotel services and not get ripped off. Update: fyi the extra fee I was charged was removed a few days later.;1;2;0;2;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
76;1/1/2012;Z44yK2SONwt8wMA0bNv;K2hfyMtZeLjMDCDOvBzjMQ;Ok, so I read a lot of reviews on yelp and another site before writing my review.  I agree with everyone that said the beds are wonderful, they truly are.  On our king size bed we had at least 5 pillows and there was one in the closet.  I love having plenty of pillows! ELEVATORS The elevators are small, very small.  Not a negative, since they move quickly.  I was very cramped when I was in there with 2 guys , a mom, her mom, and her kid.  Yikes, I was afraid the cables wouldn't hold.   CHECK IN/OUT The lobby is small, but the staff was very pleasant and welcoming!  I was pleased that we were able to check in early and check out late.  We checked in at noon and out at 1:00, huge plus!  They also kept our bags until we caught the train home later that day at 6.   STAFF Everyone that we had contact with was sweet and polite.  The consierge (sp???) was great!  Super helpful. RESTAURANT ON LOCATION Unless you got the Groupon that we did skip Mei Fornetto, it's not worth it for breakfast.  Pretty expensive.  We didn't eat there for any other meal.  The food we had was really good, though. ROOM Our room had a horrible view, but whatever, I could really care less.  I prefer to walk in it instead of just looking at it!  We had no issue with the shower at all.  We had no issue with hearing anyone around us.  The room was a little on the dark side.  The TV is in an odd location for watching TV in bed...until my husband figured out you can slide the doors in and pull the TV out.  Again, the beds totally rock.  Everything was clean.  I'm pretty leary about taking a bath in a hotel, but I did-several times and didn't worry about it at all.  I didn't like how we didn't have a coffee maker in the room.  I get up earlier than my husband and the first thing I like to do is have some coffee in my jammies.  I couldn't, unless I wanted to brave the lobby that way.  It also really pissed me off when they took the coffee away before 11 AM!!!  It's supposed to be out until then, but was taken away by 10:40 one of the mornings, grrr.  Don't mess with my coffee.  The coffee situation is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me.  The internet was included with our Groupon.  Had I paid for it I wouldn't have been to pleased, it was pretty sketchy. SUGGESTIONS We ate at Nuevo Leon in Little Village (we are in the Detroit area, and here it's called Mexicantown).  The food was great!  Cash only and out of the way, but we were kid free for a few days and it was not a big deal.  We took the 151 to State/Lake and then got on the pink line to 18th, walked a few blocks and were there. Get a Metra pass for the time you are there, it's so much easier and the locals are very helpful for which bus you need.  We got ours at Union Station when our Amtrak came in, it was $14pp for 3 days-totally worth it!;4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
77;3/14/2010;a0PaOckJTHLyfNc8l92GPQ;VMNt8vQrzWL6taFm7tlKWw;This is the best value hotel in Chicago hands down.  And I think it's because of all the renovations that were going on.  I read some other reviews and found that they've been going on for some time.  I always wondered why it was so cheap for a landmark hotel each time I saw it on Orbitz.  I'm sure the prices will go up once they are finished. My room had a sort of old charm.  I originally reserved a kingsize bed, but took the queen just so I could check in early.  Queen beds are pretty small once you've been sleeping in a kingsize for the better part of your life.  But it was sufficient. Minibar, check.  In-room safe, check.  Duvet, check. The location doesn't get much better.  You're a block away from Water Tower Place and everything you need is in walking distance.  If you take a quick trip down the alley adjacent to the hotel, you'll find yourself at a Starbucks, and if you take the alley across the street, you'll find an Einstein Bros. bagel shop.  Both among my favorites. My only complaints: They charged for crappy "wired" internet. When I checked in, I told them that my flight wasn't until 7pm on my day of departure and they suggested I book another night--which I did.  Meanwhile, on the insert that my room key came in, they said that for $60, that they can accommodate late check-out up to 6pm.  So I reversed the reservation and told them I'd like to take advantage of their $60 charge instead.  When my check-out time came, I called just to confirm that I would be leaving late and the guy said I could stay until 1pm.  Why would I pay $60 to stay an extra hour when I could have booked another night for a preferential rate of $90?  Finally after a bit of attitude, he agreed to let me stay until 5pm.  I left at 4.;3;1;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

79;12/4/2010;E783DbIufiLD92bCd8ZeXg;xHzZOs8vw7XczppeVWVigQ;UPDATE: Stayed here again for the same conference.  Between 2 - 3 stars.  I did like that they were willing to call me when they had a room available since I checked in early. I thought I was supposed to be in a pinnacle king (which i booked on http://Hotels.com) and mentioned this to the lady who checked me in.  She told me "yeah, you're in a superior king"  Only after I had unpacked all my stuff did I realize that there WAS a difference ( I thought maybe there were two names for the same room).  At that point, it wasn't worth calling to complain. Laid down to take a nap after I got into my room at 12:30.  Was woken up about an hour later by the lady who came to check the mini bar to see if the prior occupants had used anything.  Saw her doing the same two days later when I was leaving.  Why not do it when the room is being cleaned?    Still got charged for a Snickers i had to call and ask to be removed from my bill (I HATE snickers). At least twice when someone came to my room, I was in the bathroom, and heard them getting keys out to enter my room....had to hop off the toilet so they wouldn't find me in a compromising position. Last year thought the Whitehall was great.  This year....not so much.  These seem like system issues, not random issues that could happen to anyone. Stayed at the Whitehall a week for a conference. Pros:  Incredibly comfy beds and fine linens.  Large spacious room, considering it is an older hotel.  I had two queen beds, but there were also two sitting chairs with a table in between them.  Each bed had a bedside table.  Everything was well spread out, not cramped together.  Elevators were small, but fast (last year I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and routinely waited 5 minutes for an elevator, which irritated me).  Beautiful tile work in the bathroom.  Friendly, accomodating staff.  Lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom.  Close to Michigan Ave. Cons:  Small bathroom, although this is not unexpected given it is an older hotel.  No ice machines on the floors.  I really hated this.  Every time you want ice, you have to call room service.  Then I wasn't sure if I should tip for something I'd rather do myself anyways?  TV was old and of poor quality, and the movie channels (pay per view) didn't come in well. As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons.;2;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

We just walked around town for a bit, and our room was ready. The valet parking was $45 a night (or for 24 hours) but was convenient and safe. They have free coffee and tea in the morning. Only one downer was that wireless is $9.99 a day, what? Who charges for internet these days? I guess they want to keep that also historic just like their building. You could tell the building wasn't brand new, but the rooms were very clean and neat. Air conditioning worked great and the water pressure was awesome. They have clean down pillows and down comforter which made me feel at home. If it wasn't for the paid wireless internet, I would have given them 5 stars.

It's located in a great spot close to everything.  Navy Pier was our farthest walk at almost a mile. I will say the window glass must be pretty thin because there was a bit of street noise.

82;9/11/2009;RTnNZv0nExodycq0O41jQQ;iSWsgppkv4dNyhDMGTpOJw;After staying at a big hotel like the Hyatt, I really appreciated The Whitehall Hotel, and how quiet and cozy it is. Location, fabulous, a block away from the Hancock Observatory, and a few blocks away from Oak Street beach, and the red line. The room and bathroom were very nice (see pictures). Luis approved. Layout of room was OK, until I opened the drawers. The bed and drawers are too close to each other, if the drawers are open it blocks the path to walk to the other side of the room. I did not like this, it didn't make me feel fancy anymore. No nice view here. I don't know if I was just not lucky enough to get a nice view or if all rooms are like this. But since I didn't plan to look out the window that much, it didn't bother me. One more thing I will complain about is the temperature of the room. I don't know if it was me that didn't know how to work the thermostat thing or if It was set to a standard temperature. I love my room to be über cold, so I can sleep, and every time I would get back to my room after going out, it would be too hot for me. No likey my room warm. So I had to adjust it every time.  Annoying. The tv was pretty old too, a little upgrade and new furniture wouldn't hurt. Things I liked, were that it was quiet, it didn't feel like a mall, not a lot of people. Most of the time the elevator was not crowded, and it was fast. The service was very nice. The person at the front desk recommended me going to a nearby Internet cafe to use the computer instead of using the hotel's. That way I would get to use the Internet and get a nice cup of coffee instead of just spending my money at the hotel's business center. I thought that was nice of him. I stayed here for 4 days. I probably was that guy that came in at 2am every night, that someone commented earlier on their review, but I did not slam the door, the door makes a big noise when it locks. Sorry. Lol. Anyways. I loved coming back to my room and sleeping in that bed after a long night. I'd definitely stay here again. The things I complained about are no biggie, but if fixed they would get a 5 star.;4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
83;7/3/2010;480Hu5-p9VGPOGUUvqJJzw;e4bWHnuCXAF5Wq4L2WXMvA;Got a good deal on a room here--decent location, but a bit boring in the Upper East Side kind of way. Rooms are very nice and spacious. I'd stay here again. The building used to be luxury apartments way back when, but then morphed into a hotel, and now a "luxury boutique" hotel. It's got a nice wood-paneled lobby that used to serve as a private restaurant for the former luxury apartments.;4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
84;10/20/2011;5nwkhWmtvJSPC-xk6vBeng;5oI-FVc_wS39dGehbD2PfQ;I will keep this short & sweet...  Chicago is a beautiful, clean city!  As far as our hotel stay for a week not so beautiful.  The bed was very comfortable, but the room felt dirty.  We were supposedly upgraded to a room with peeling wall paper and very scuffed up furniture and walls.  I wouldn't consider that an upgrade.  The location and beautiful city, good company of my significant other and bed were about all that I remember.;1;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
85;6/13/2011;DRNrV1cWXo5FgWBaJ758Sw;OG1NrYwCdlARzD4Qgssz7Q;I was raised in Chicago and downtown and the north side are my stomping grounds. When I saw the rate for the Whitehall hotel online I jumped at the chance to stay in the heart of the Gold Coast walking distance from all of my favorite places.                                                                    The only reason they are not getting a better star review from me is because.....when I went to raise the window in my room the entire window came off in my hand and I almost fell out from the 15 floor. I put it back on the tracks and cracked the other window to get some air  instead. The outlets were loose in the walls and the shower head was loose. They advertise mini bar in the room but don't think that is a fridge because it is not.                   Other than that the staff was nice enough not all smiles but it is Chicago. . . The sheets and the bed were amazing and the gym is pretty cool to have to work out in. This place is about location. You cannot beat the price for were you are. Parking is a bitch....$48 a night but what you gonna do . . . It's Chicago.   Walk over to the Pancake House 7am-3pm for the best breakfast in the Gold Coast. Over all I would stay there again for the price.;3;1;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
86;3/19/2010;WceuErWVXU;yZBBIMLJMSKi36linH35uA;Stayed here in February for the Illinois Bar Exam.  All in all, not a bad place! Pros:  The food is great, the bathrooms (recently remodeled) were fabulous and the mini-bar is well stocked and the prices are not out of the ballpark.  Plus, they are undergoing a remodel and they have really worked hard to accentuate their space.  the building itself is not very large, with lots of twisty turny hallways, but they apportioned and accommodated it well.  Also, the gym is really complete as far as hotel gyms go. Cons:  It takes a bit for the staff to warm up to you.  They are brusque and professional, but it seems like you have to talk to them for several minutes before they start to be nice as well.  Also, it took the valet a long time to find my car.  Finally, about the re-model, I'd have liked them to follow through a bit more . For a 4 star hotel, there were too many visible wallpaper seams and other such aesthetic issues showing.   BUT, I would gladly stay here again.;4;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
87;4/11/2006;yi7;ctwwsl5_DSCzwPxtjzdl2A;A lovely hotel, although the rooms on the higher floors seem to be more recently renovated (it would probably have only gotten three stars if I'd stayed in my friend's room down on the third floor instead of my lofty one with the fluffy comforters and down pillows on the 16th). It's really close to Michigan Avenue shopping and the feeble contemporary art museum, but a bit of a walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park.;4;3;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
88;9/6/2010;DHIbNg-KjtXBmIN7ypKaGw;ZG6c3GaUjBf-wNhSbKYbpA;Beautiful clean room. Very attentive service. After I has been in my room for 20 min the concierge called to see if I was happy with my room.

89;2/21/2012;j5XT00CkVLt;Q_QfVg-YgMcqCR9jdg6oKg;I have to say that this is the worst place I have ever stayed at. Reserving a room was a hassle because I had to wait for the concierge to call me back...3 hours later. When we arrived the door man was pleasant and polite. The staff at the front...wasn't even present. We had to stand there for about 10 minutes before the doorman went back to look for the guy. Then front desk staff guy said they "upgraded" our room. We were okay to hear this. When we got to our room...disappointed. The elevators are ghetto and old looking. The hallway to our room is dark and shabby looking. The cups in our room had finger prints all over them. The shower had mold in the caulk and in the corners. The caulking at the base of the tub and the floor was cracked and stained looking. The toilet was dirty looking. They do not have ice machines or a vending machine for snacks or a small hotel store. We needed some ice for drinks we bought to the room and they sent up a guy with an ice bucket. This guy was not professional at all. He came in with regular street clothes and he actually welcomed himself in the room without my okay for him to come in. The ice is from the chinese restaurant downstairs. There is nothing luxurious or hotel like about this place. It is as creepy as a run down motel. Checking out took us 15 minutes before the front desk guy even came to the front. He was very rude. We were only staying at this hotel because we had a certificate given to us. I did not like this place. Do not spend your money on this place!;1;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

The beds are super comfortable. The Whitehall is just fabulous!;5;2;2;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
91;1/13/2008;VZVFYq3d7FhlxfqorGZEZw;28PP52d1CtAEyas5HToT5A;NOTE:  I have never actually stayed in the hotel -- this is for their bar/restaurant. Ok, I must admit, I used to be the kind of girl who loved hotel bars.  But that was a lifetime ago and I stopped that sort of thing.  But, awhile back, I started getting my hair done across the street at Studio 110 and having cocktails before and after at the Whitehall across the street (seriously, try going to your next hair appointment loaded - it's super fun.)  Anyway, it's not your typical hotel bar.  And the food is delicious.  Specifically, the pot stickers (those are the ones that are steamed right?)  Well, these motherf*ckers changed my life.  That and their pizzas.  delicious.  use the hot chili oil.  do it!  Me and two others split a pizza and had a dozen dumplings (they had a few -- i had many) and a a delicious Cab.  I was in heaven.  Pure heaven.  Do it.  The next time you are downtown or at Studio 110, go here for food and drinks.  Plus, when you walk to the back bar area (not the restaurant) you can sit on big plush couches and chairs and hang out and drink and eat.  It's so not typical Michigan Ave. I bet staying at the hotel is nice too...get loaded and roll on up to bed.;5;1;1;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
92;12/23/2011;w0za;5EI6N7X5Fo_FMgZVJ_7J4Q;Great location for a cozy hotel at a fraction of the price of the hotels within a block or two.

93;8/27/2005;UGN6y;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;Chicago has many lovely smaller old-fashioned hotels of the boutique variety. The Whitehall may just be the classiest of the bunch. It can barely be categorized as a smaller hotel, but with slightly over 200 rooms it definitely is no behemoth convention hotel. The building is a charmer, and it has a great location just off from Michigan Avenue. The rooms are plush and so are the bathrobes.;4;1;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ
94;7/10/2011;-bAgEcUcYZWQmnooNs4Ukg;MDCEe1nWUlgsymC2AbVTmA;I wanted to spend the night downtown with my man for his birthday so I hot wired a hotel. We got this one. The hotel itself is in a perfect location if you want to experience all that Chicago has to offer. Close to Water tower, The Hancock and all the bars and restaurants. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff who were very friendly. At check in I could see a look of concern cross Derrick's face and I knew there was going to be some drama rama with the fact that we booked through hot wire. He said the room I had booked was not available , however, he was able to upgrade us to a better room which I thought was very nice of him. I do question why I am able to book a room but not actually know for sure that I have it. Derrick advised that we book direct in future which I understand but the whole point of Hot wire is no get a better deal right? The room itself was nice, very large four poster bed, although I think someone may have swung from them as they were a little wonky! The sheets were lovely quality and so comfy. The TV was kinda old school but was fine. Overall this was a nice hotel and a good value. I like that it was small and "boutique" and close to the action.;4;1;1;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

100;10/5/2011;1xrjhjVP2gw8vgGuBZ7goA;nCSaVr64W2Z0dnGau9BrOQ;I'm from a college town in central Ilinois. I travel a fair amount for twentysomething, and I was raised by a single mom without a ton of money to burn. So that's my perspective going into this. My mom was asked to come up to the city to have a corporate meeting and dinner with the suits afterwards. Since we're very close and I'll take any excuse to be in the city ('sup H&M and newly opened Topshop), she got the okay for me to come along. She was assured that the room was put on the company card and she wouldn't have to pay for it to be later reimbursed. She even got a printed confirmation of this, and the company card info. When we got there, this wasn't the case. I waited out front in the rain with the painfully friendly valet workers for a while and found out that they needed her to pay for the room after all, and it would only be straightened out once the corporate people got there. One of the employees wasn't too nice about it, and said that the refund could only be done by the manager the next morning. This was a lie, because a regular old employee did it anyway (still the next morning, however). The rooms are very spacious. There's a little kitchenette/minibar type situation (with no liquor, though, boo) with small appliances, a living room/office with a pullout couch, desk, chair, table, and a flatscreen. The bathroom is nice, and the shower has a tall showerhead (I'm almost six feet, rejoice). The bedroom is okay, with lots of pillows and another flatscreen. The brightness of the TVs auto adjusts to the light in the room, which I like. We were almost on the top floor, and when I was in my bed, I was looking right at the Hancock Building, which was across the street. WiFi costs $10 for 24 hours, which I did not see coming, and wasn't too happy about. Location is obviously fantastic, even if the closest train stop is slightly farther than convenient after a long day. If you can afford to stay here, you're probably not taking a train around town. At the end of the day, it was impressive in the ways it needs to be for its demographic. But for a college girl who knows the city like the back of her hand (read: just wants convenient trains to neighborhoods I care about, not to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and shop at Water Tower) and is used to free WiFi and breakfast in her hotel rooms, it left a few things to be desired. But hey, we didn't pay for it! Well technically we had to. But we got our money back the next day.;3;0;0;0;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw
101;2/11/2011;O0Pvde4bDp7rJ;TVLh_KiYi0vBq03HvTjMGw;I am a fan of the Hilton chain of hotels and this one proves no different. The rooms are large, it's an all suite hotel, and as a single traveller I had plenty of room for myself. It was really nice to be able to spread out. The bed is soft and the sheets are comfortable. The heating worked and I had a great view of the lake. The people who work there were helpful and knowledgeable about the local area and how to get around. I felt safe in the neighborhood and walking around at all hours. It is close to places to eat and shopping. It's off the beaten path so you don't hear traffic or the noise of the street. The heated pool and the hot tub were a much enjoyed added bonus. I felt spoiled as I sat in the hot bubbles and watched a blizzard fall outside. This is a great hotel and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It is good for families, singles, couples (although it's not overtly romantic) and business travelers. There is a charge for internet (which I don't ever agree with in hotels) and they have room service, but no breakfast. There are better places to stay in Chicago, but this is a good choice if you're given it. Enjoy!;4;2;1;1;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw

105;3/5/2009;Wyj1H7;JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg;I recently had a wonderful stay at this Hilton location. The linens and curtains were surprisingly modern and tasteful (unlike at some hotels - ahem, plaid, floral, etc!) in neutral colour offerings and the suite was very spacious. The hotel itself was very quiet and insulated from all outside noise. I booked the room using http://www.hotwire.com (highly recommended). The hotel was perfectly located in the popular "Magnificent Mile" near several subway lines. If you want to experience "the windy city" this is the place to do it as there are so many tall buildings surrounding it, it's constantly blowing!! Conveniently located right across from the John Hancock building. The only downside is the internet - you can get wi-fi in your room but it's expensive ($12.95/day) or you can use the business centre if you're even MORE of a moneybags (pay by the minute I think). IMO it should be more affordable, especially for such a large hotel. Would definitely stay there again for a no fuss, flexible stay. Check in/check out times were reasonable and they gladly held our bags for no charge after we had checked out so we could enjoy our final day without baggage.;5;2;1;0;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw

Not really a problem, just later than I'm used to, and really we only needed some necessities replaced. However, towels were not replaced (even after calling to ask for new ones). Toilet paper was not stocked (we assumed there'd be some somewhere in the room if they didn't replace the empty roll... we were wrong). When we asked for a mini fridge to be brought up to the room, we were told it wouldn't be a problem. It never came and we had to call 3 times before it was finally brought up to the room. We waited nearly 30 min for valet to bring around the car after being told it would be 15 min... normally I'm patient, but when given an expected wait time, I tend to count that it's accurate. It only made things worse when we were completely ignored while we were waiting. It would have made things slightly better it some one would have at least come up to say 'we apologize for the wait.' (One last side note on the cleaning, on the last day there, on doing a final check of the room to make sure everyone had their things, I discovered a random shoe of unknown origin... just one... who knows how long it had been there).  Overall, it's a nice hotel, and -very- convenient.

We were very surprised at our room!  We loved that it was a suite with a frig and microwave.  It had a TV in the living room and bedroom.  We had a great view on the 24th floor, too.  For an even better view, go up to the pool on the 30th floor.  You can see for miles and miles up there!  My husband loved the Precor ellipticals in the fitness room. No free breakfast and even a Nutrigrain breakfast bar cost $2!  We didn't go to the restaurant or bar, so I can't comment on that.   I would highly recommend this hotel, and we have stayed at quite a few downtown hotels!;4;1;0;0;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw
116;3/28/2011;fwa4WEeR0RE8w1PbvT7bPQ;SDl2m8rm_OIWYPzN33z_9A;Overall clean, great price, and location.  Great views from the workout areas and swimming pool.  Very nice having a separate living room.  However the parking is crazy for $52/day (park in one of the nearby garages for $26-33 instead) and the hot tub needs cleaning/renovation - lots of black grout.  The drop-off area is very congested with taxis.;4;2;0;0;yiXTDN-dfNq3NKXZPKgsaw

118;7/4/2012;SOckBTPPRnx46OIcRtly5Q;8Gy1MJ4gCnOL8qiwD2ZGLQ;I loved this location... It was prime.  I always love being in Chicago, but the smaller hotels are usually easier accessible to the busy spots. The decor was beachy, very non-urban, but I liked it as it gave me ideas for my Miami condo which I'm redecorating! (go figure, get the idea from chicago) The poorest possible thing was the front desk.... One guy, sweet but not quick at all was manning a manic line of check ins... There was a sign for IHG Elite members but nobody was there to work it... I liked my place there, especially the awesome upgrade to a suite, made a huge difference... Loved the chic Indigo vibe... Pricing was average.;4;0;1;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
119;9/14/2012;kwnGk0rtp038KRKBYQf3DQ;cydkiUKwlr3B2CaFRDeRfg;The good and the bad.... Pros -Hotel is in a good location. Residential area. I felt safe walking alone outside the hotel. -The beachy/nautical decor is cute! Felt like i was at a beach house w/o the beach.. -Room was clean and the bed was VERY comfy! Couldnt get out of the bed in the a.m. LOVED my room on the 10th floor. -On the 10th floor, the shutters opened to a view of downtown -Most of the staff was really nice! -Lobby/Bar area is really cute -FREE Wi-fi   Cons -My friend didnt specify a preference and ended up on a smoking (4th) floor. The hotel was completely booked so she couldnt change. As soon as the elevator opened on her floor it reeked of smoke. Im not a smoker so it was completely suffocating for me when i visited her room for 5mins. She stayed 3nights and was completely miserable. (MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY) -The lady w/ the long dark hair was rude. -Ordered room service (the croissant sandwich) for bfast and it was absolutely horrible. Bacon tasted like rubber..Couldnt finish it.. -Cabs rarely come in front of the hotel so you'll need to walk down the block to Division (not far.. just inconvenient) to catch one. -Several bars, a Starbucks, & Walgreens in the area but not many good food choices... we cabbed it to other areas.;3;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
120;5/22/2012;w0lXJpm1m2P1Rj7qW1NhVA;rtIBgGmyq6nHHPaU1E7Zmg;This was a last minute weekend to downtown Chicago, I prefer boutique hotels over large big box hotels. I found a great rate on Expedia $180 per night and their website looked like a place I would like so I booked it. I was pleased when I arrived, my room was ready, staff was friendly and the entire hotel was clean. I loved the beachy decor, made me think I was out in California by the ocean. About my only complaint was the laminate flooring in the rooms, it was a little warped and looked cheap, otherwise the furnishings, bedding and other amenities were nice and upscale. I will keep this hotel on my short list for future trips downtown.;4;2;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
121;12/16/2011;UiTN1aExDCoa3b8NFE6hxQ;8ZWYZwYjO9vrfmdhDLc4TA;For the price and location, this is a great hotel.  It's quiet and clean and all of the staff is professional.  It feels like a beach house in the middle of a concrete jungle but it was always comfortable to come back to, especially the gas fireplace. For tourism, it's only about a 10 minute cab ride to just about anywhere you want to go and any landmarks/museums you want to see.  I would absolutely consider staying here on a future visit.;4;1;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
122;2/23/2012;7hO4DIX7BBDDuMHlctmlSA;fkVV3pPLCsN0sFsusyIJ7g;I booked the room through priceline which was an excellent deal for what I received. This is definitely a boutique hotel with chic nautical charm... not what you would expect to find in chicago's Gold Coast. They have a restaurant and in room dining after 5pm... pricey but the salmon was great. My room had a stand up shower with no tub so if you need a bath tub, I recommend asking for one. They offer both smoking and non smoking rooms. The non smoking room I was in dId not smell like smoke at all. They have free wifi and cute rooms but have out dated television sets. They carry Aveda bath products, keurig coffe in the room and the beds are pretty comfy. Don't drink the bottled water in the room, that will run you $4 a pop (what!?) But chicago boasts some of this nation's cleanest water straight from the tap. They also have a fitness and buisness center. The staff is wonderful which is why all the stars. I feel the staff really makes a place feel more like home away from home. If you need a cab to come get you use American united taxi... (773) 248-7600;5;1;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
123;8/8/2011;EiQXV3TSd5coJ;MI3wG3R12sQuTGdNvBBX3A;What a cute place! I was completely caught off guard by this classy, boutique hotel nestled in the Chicago Gold Coast. And speaking of coasts, this place had an uncanny resemblance to Alexander's Guesthouse on Key West. Hotel Indigo was VERY beachy, but also quite classy. Backwards script discussed "phi" along the walls (luckily, I can read backwards), which I thought looked cool but was weird (why was it backwards?). We approached the counter and the two men stayed near the back and glanced at us with a silent question in their facial expressions. "Can we check in?" That's when they jumped to attention. Weird that they didn't make the first move. The entry area to our room was the best. There was a small foyer area with a long table and mirror. To the right was our bathroom and the bedroom was to the left. The floors were "wooden," and the walls were a pretty periwinkle with green accents. One wall had enlarged pictures of mussles. The view from our window was to a fire-escape with a brick wall beyond (not the beach I expected). Other things to note: - Aveda soaps/lotions/shampoo - comfortable bed - tube tv - unpopulated bar - breakfast place also seemed unpopular (there's a great breakfast place just two doors north of the hotel) - free wifi - we could hear other guests down the hall, but not loud enough to be bothersome;4;6;1;2;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
124;7/17/2011;ozz0pw1L9cjo8q6QVyifXQ;HF96EkVqJeSPTU-mMzJfow;I needed a place to stay after moving out of my apartment on my way out of town for a new job.  I lived less than a block away from the Hotel Indigo, and with the Ambassador East under renovation, it was really the only choice in my neighborhood. The normal rates for this place are nuts - $180/night.  If you use Hotwire or Priceline you pay at least half that, but keep in mind you lose the ability to choose your bed type or smoking/non-smoking preferences.  I was placed in a smoking room - at the front desk, they cheerfully told me I could "upgrade" to a non-smoking room for $75/night (which basically nullifies the rate I found on Hotwire), and when I showed no interest in that, they brought it down to $40.  Since all I really needed was a bed, and a place to bathe, it wasn't the end of the world, and I declined all their upgrade offers. My room faintly smelled of cigarette smoke, and I could barely even notice it.  The hallway, on the other hand, had a noticeable odor.  Thankfully my room was near the elevators so I was exposed to that for only a few seconds. The room was adequate... I wouldn't define it as tiny but it might feel that way if two people were in the room.  The seashore motif was not that annoying.  The bed, however, was on wheels, and would start rolling away from the headboard (wall-mounted) which was very cumbersome.  Also, a large wooden tray with glasses and an ice bucket is on the bed and there really isn't any convenient place to put it when you're ready to lie down. In terms of other room features: the TV was dated (LodgeNet?  I had to laugh at the welcome screen's voice-over actress: Canadian - "Welcome to Chicag-OH, and thank you for staying at Hootel Indig-OH")  but I definitely enjoyed the Keurig coffee brewer, with a cup of tea at night before bed and a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.  The bathroom was only a shower, with a strange showerhead that I eventually figured out, however all the fixtures were new, and the Aveda bath and body products were a nice touch.  The front desk staff were smart enough to give me the WiFi password when I checked in - I always hate getting to my room, pulling out my laptop, and having to call the desk to get the password. That said, the only problem I really had was with the lack of bellhops.  Normally I wouldn't need any help with my luggage, but since I was moving I had six pieces of luggage.  When I arrived, they didn't have anyone available immediately.  I waited about 15 minutes.  (The nice gentleman at the front desk literally had an aneurysm calling for assistance on the radio multiple times.)  The morning I left, I called early and gave them a half-hour's notice that I needed some help.  Nobody showed and I had to take care of everything myself - I was taking an airport shuttle and couldn't risk missing it. All in all, it was a decent place to stay, but just remember, if you book through a discounted booking site, you're not going to get a lot of options from this place.;3;2;0;1;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
125;3/11/2011;OvqkGRxnvU-9h2xgMoNjcg;uvqhDdqRyl1aqTlxu_UZtg;Huge fan of this hotel!!  Does it have the biggest and best rooms I've ever stayed in?  No.  But what it does have is the best staff ever!!  Tom at the front desk was awesome!  I booked the hotel through Hotwire but because I am a Holiday Inn rewards member I got 2 upgrades...yes, that's right...2.   Parking is high but that goes with the territory.  Awesome location, we walked to Mag Mile and to dinner each night. I personally loved the decor, although I know it's not for everyone.  Shower had good pressure.  Beds were comfortable.   Will stay here again in a heartbeat!;5;2;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
126;5/16/2011;AEf9N2ZIZ8eUCAHK-1CWIQ;3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg;I would stay here again for two reasons:  the staff and decor.  The front desk concierege were able to help us find a place for breakfast and hailed cabs in the blink of an eye.  I especially love the saltwater taffy at the front desk.  No crummy mints here.   I love the bright, yet calming seashore themed decor.  You forget that you're in the middle of downtown Chicago.  You can leave the metropolitan Gold Coast and step into your own seashell.  I really felt comfortable here.  How often do you hear "outdated decor" in reference to a hotel?  Not here.  No way.  Very chic, very relaxed.  Worth every penny.;5;1;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
127;7/8/2009;iA9VokcGvVdmem-s;YhIYQRzr6zpNMWAYhr23ZQ;I snagged a great rate on Hotwire to stay at the Indigo for one night on a recent stay.  The location was very convenient from Midway airport.  I hopped right on the orange line, transferred at Roosevelt to the Red Line, and walked from the Division stop.  Very easy!  I also liked the neighborhood, which was a more upscale, residential part of Chicago I hadn't seen before.  I felt safe walking here by myself after dark.  It is also a few steps from the Third Coast cafe, which is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. The rooms at the Indigo are brightly colored and I couldn't help but get a little giggly at the boardwalk decor.  It was slightly on the schmaltzy side, but I still liked it.  The bed was comfy and the room was larger than I expected. I would definitely stay at the Indigo again, especially if I can get a good rate.;4;5;1;1;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
128;9/20/2009;of7-OB15;6nKq-WX6U0bg4iyVtdMrrQ;Super precious hotel. Loved it. Will be my 'go to' hotel from now on. You heard it here first. So, I cannot stand downtown Chicago (i.e. magmile and all other typical touristy spots) so this offered a perfect location to the neighborhoody side of Chicago. It was less than a 5 minute walk to the lake, an easy easy walk to shops/eats etc, and was located on the cutest tree lined street you've ever seen surrounded by breathtaking homes. I was in heaven. The hotel was super clean and our room #701 was a corner double room with beautiful views to the homes below and I could even see the lake! It let in amazing natural light and honestly felt like my own little chicago apartment! I didn't hear a peep minus the loud girls next door who finally shut the heck up at 4am. The beds were comfortable enough, the hardwoods were great, and the room in general was spacious and so adorable. A few notes: Remote didn't work. Light fixtures were totally whacked up. And the bathroom was teeeeeny tiny. Annoyingly tiny. The rooms are showing signs of  wear if you care enough to look. I notice details because I'm anal like that, but otherwise a really really great place to be. Did I mention there were huge freakin blueberries on the wall? Cuteness overload. P.s. The front desk/entrance area smelled like vanilla. Perfect.;5;1;0;1;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
129;12/5/2011;zsq03tg73-JsuJDs08Fhxw;AAYW3BCcd3OFTu-gAlzgLg;My wife and I live in Chicago and we were looking for a 'get-away' in the city for a night for her birthday.  After playing roulette with Hotwire and receiving Hotel Indigo as the inexpensive boutique hotel in the Gold Coast area, I have to be honest and say that I was little disappointed based on the photos.  It seemed like it was a little out-dated/tacky for our taste, but we made it do. When we arrived at the hotel, everyone was extremely friendly and they even went above and beyond by adding a little romantic touch to our room when we arrived late at night.   If you're looking for a good/clean inexpensive place to stay and you can look past some of the 'disney-esque' decor, then I would definitely recommend this place for you...Just don't use the parking garage next door- it's valet only, overpriced and they only have two men working on weekend so we waited over half an hour for our car.;4;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
130;2/1/2010;LZRevUyIrjBIw7nzCz807g;u5l58KYAOiW2sdPFWIFciQ;Really liked the pineapple stools at the bar in the lobby and the saltwater taffy. Beautiful decor, but the nautical theme didn't fit the location. Parking garage is conveniently next door. Smoking. Can smell it in the hallway. Would I go back? No. 1. Booked a king, but got a queen 2. Price of parking was absurd. 3. Size of room is pretty outrageous, expected in NY, but not Chicago. The windows looked out into the back of the building next door. 4. Overpriced 5. Lobby doesn't offer coffee.;2;1;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
131;7/16/2012;KQc;sE4vihO8o2r2JK6UITyPUg;I LOVE staying at this hotel! The beds are always amazing and the staff is wonderful. Tom checked me in on my last trip--super nice guy who offered me a room even though it was prior to check in.  He said if I didn't like the room I could wait for something else. Room was spacious and beautiful, but no view...and when I'm in Chicago, I need my view. Tom got me into a smaller room with great views of the Sears tower. Totally happy. Internet was included--yay--and if I have any complaint, it's that the parking is tough in that area and valet is too rich for my blood.  I go here because it's cozy and friendly and makes me feel at home...i do not go there because the rooms are big. Its one of the best boutique hotels around and the location is second to none. Forgot to say...the above and beyond part was the fact that I was STARVING after traveling all day and could have eaten my shoe, I was so hungry. When Tom saw me eyeballing a plate of cookies and cakes (a staff reward for their high accolades on TripAdvisor) he kindly offered his cupcake to me. How nice was that!;5;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
132;1/18/2010;23;Eu9t9pDcGADgtNNs7h8UMw;It's okay.  I booked Hotel Indigo on Hotwire for just over $80/night after taxes and fees (it's a 3 1/2 star hotel in the "Gold Coast" area, if you're looking to Hotwire it..), and it was a decent place to stay. Like everyone else, I can't help but be confused by the beach-ish theme. Coming here in the dead of winter, it seems.. incongruous at best and somewhat taunting at worst. Smallish rooms, but clean and well-appointed. Free WiFi. The location is good, definitely in a cooler, hipper, more residential area than Mag Mile or Loop hotels I've stayed in before, but the hotel itself if nothing spectacular. Free caramel Andes candies in the lobby. I doubt I'd pay full price for it, but - like nearly every hotel I Yelp - it was a good Hotwire find.;3;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
133;8/3/2010;wSHWNkgD8GzoiQHdJA2m;MauYPNEOQJGFpUHGgwT-iQ;BIG FAN of this hotel.  Super close to EVERYTHING.  In walking distance to Michigan Ave food and shops.  3 minutes from the Red Line.  3 minutes from the little Irish-bar area.  Very friendly staff - the airlines threw our 3.4 oz toothpaste away and we got a new tube quickly.  We got lucky with an amazing view, as they put us on the 11th floor overlooking the city.  The rooms are a bit small, but it wasn't a big deal at all for us, since we spent all our time out and about in the city.  And I love any place that has FREE WiFi.  Many many thanks for not nickel and diming people. For anyone looking for a great hotel, close to everything - Hotel Indigo is definitely a good one.  I'd stay here again on my next visit.;5;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
134;8/3/2009;TYtYlrYo948kAGCxbxJTAA;iSWsgppkv4dNyhDMGTpOJw;The Hotel Indigo had a piña colada feel, with a smoothie-shop-decor, and the lobby smelled like coconut lotion. When hotwire notified me that I had made reservations for the hotel Indigo, I went to check it out on-line. The pictures scared me a little. I thought It would be too girly or cutesy for me. I was prepared to not be amused by this hotel. Once I arrived, It wasn't as bad as I thought... It was kind of cheerful. The service: was ok, nothing to complaint about or rave about either. No stars there. The room was one of the smallest rooms I've had in Chicago. But it was neat, clean and had everything I really needed. Nice small room, with a small window, but for the price I paid it was ok. Loved the location. Good restaurants, shopping, and the beach are all so close. Just take Division and it takes you right to the beach. After a long night out, my friends and I came back to the hotel area and decided to go to the beach and see the sunrise before calling it a night. It was a nice thing we could do since the hotel was a few blocks away. It was a nice hotel to stay at once, but I think I saw other 'nicer' hotels around that area that I might want to try next time I visit Chicago.;3;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
135;1/12/2011;ME;8D3CDu9no5NRquTbYaKVFg;I've stayed here about 10 times over the last few months, and will continue to stay here. The hotel is a bit outside of the loop, and it can be difficult to catch a cab occasionally in the morning. Great on-site fitness center, with multiple nice machines, 2 treadmills, a bike, a stair stepper and a small selection of free weights. The staff is friendly, although I've had very little interaction with them other than check-in/check-out. Rooms are clean to an 8/10 - some mildew spots on the ceiling of my shower last night and there are little details here and there that should be tended to, but good overall. Would like coffee in the lobby, but that would take away from their little coffee shop at the back of the hotel. There's a Jewel-Osco grocery store around the block if you like to buy groceries (no fridge or microwave in the room though), and the CTA Red line is around the corner also if you prefer to catch the train to downtown rather than cab.

I liked the fitness center, and the attention to small details. The internet connection worked perfectly and was complimentary! Very quality experience.  Definitely staying here again when I'm in Chicago!

141;6/30/2009;pKZZYT4npzmvu7cbYF5-iA;A9blsObvhtFH7jc-UBjWrg;My husband surprised me with a stay at Hotel Indigo for the weekend. First, I have to say that this is a good hotel for a weekend getaway but I would not reccomend it for a long extended stay, since there is no closet space. I loved the lobby, it had a modern pallete and is scented based on the season. The scent was pineapple for the summer and it was just so refreshing. The front desk staff always remembered us and always said hello to us, which is a nice change from large chain hotels. The room itself is cozy, but I loved the king size bed and the great comforter that was on it. Also Aveda bath products were a plus. The few cons I have are the shower curtain never seemed to keep the water out. They really should just put a shower door. The air conditioner was either really cold or not cold enough and it was a bit noisy. The ice machine is on the 2nd floor and when I went, it was out of ice. I called and they brought me a HUGE bag of ice (way more than any one person could consume, so I had to put it in my sink), but they were quick in bringing it. Last, we said we were staying for our anniversary and they really didn't do anything for us. I don't expect anything, but always give props to hotels that go the one up. Also, since it is a boutique hotel, I would have thought that they would have done something special for us. I would definitely go back for a weekend getaway.;4;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA
142;7/23/2012;9nqe11-K2iSfW7QhHejk;7ZGG0zAaJAyymNnugTsqzA;I recently came to the city to do House Hunting for work and because nothing was preferred with my company in the area, I chose the Holiday Inn as I have always been happy with their service:however, there is a first time for everything. I will start out with the good: - Beds are super soft - Wireless was fast and had a good connection - Close to Clinton Blue line Now the bad: Before taking a shower, I noticed that there was shampoo, and two bottles of lotion. My companion called the front desk to get some conditioner thinking the maid just mixed up the bottles because they look similar. Within minutes (good) a man was at our delivering four bottles. However, upon inspection we saw that it was two shampoos and two lotions. We were a bit mystified and wondering if you could use lotion for conditioner all rational thought says no, so we called the front desk again proposing the question. Her response was rather rude as she stated lotion was lotion not conditioner.   Next, the walls are thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway as well as the neighbors coming back in their drunken stupor at 4 am. Not to mention because the hotel is located close to the interstate and subway, there is a lot of noise at night. The hotel parking is not free. There is a $35/day charge but you can get it for $25 if you sign up for something for free. There is a parking lot located below that you can pay per day but it was very sketchy. As we were walking to the subway, three men were hanging in the area and yelled very rude comments and six hours later when we returned they were still there. I am glad I was not alone as I did not feel safe. No complementary breakfast Finally, there was no refrigerator or microwave so I could not heat up my amazing leftovers from Artisan catering!   Final Review: This place is not worth it;1;0;0;0;qgpP1FOFrlssColqP2u-xA
143;3/4/2009;27xARiK-aQwIWbYBHJggUQ;2t4iMoZe5L69jmD2P19ofg;Ehhhhh.  Extremely noisy, curtains were completely ripped up, weird rust-colored (blood-colored?) stains in the tub, semi-questionable neighborhood, and "valet" parking is a complete joke (don't pay for it, just park in the adjoining lot for half the price).  The staff, however, were incredibly friendly and helpful, much more than you would expect given how shitty the hotel looks, hence the 3 stars instead of 2.  That, and it's very accessible via both public transit and the interstates. I stayed at this Holiday Inn because they were the only downtown hotel I could find that had a room and parking package that was within my per diem, and that will be the only reason I ever stay here again.;3;3;0;1;qgpP1FOFrlssColqP2u-xA
144;8/20/2010;m8Z8;L3yDKTulyxiL_SOL40uzpw;I will NEVER ever use travelocity's secret hotel application even if my life depended on it! Travelocity rated this hotel with 4/5 stars, which is pretty high since other hotels such as Inn of Chicago, Allerton, Drake, etc are also rated 4/5 or higher. The lobby was very VERY tiny and full of kids running around. The front desk personnel was helpful and friendly:she was very helpful and answered all the questions I had. I had booked a "secret" room through travelocity and luckily it ended up being a king. Upon entering my room, I noticed it smelled like wet towels that have been laying there for days. The room was rather small and the lights flickered. The bathroom took up 1/3 of the entire room! There were weird stains in the bathtub and the towels smelled like straight up bleach. There was a giant crack in the wall near the window (EEEEK!!!) Usually at other hotels, you can control the temperature in your own room. Not this hotel apparently. The AC kicks on whenever it feels like and every time it does, its so loud that your forced awake. It usually turns off by itself after a few minutes to let you fall asleep and then the cycle begins again! I paid an extra $30 a day for valet parking. To be honest, I was rather surprised this place offered that service to the guests. However when I asked for my car, the valet just simply handed me the key. I paid $30 for them to HAND me my key??? To make matters worse, it took me 30 minutes to find a cab in downtown Chicago around that area. The next morning, I woke up to what sounded like construction drilling. I checked out VERY early. I checked online and apparently, a room at this hotel for the night will cost you around $185!!! I only paid $75, but had I known, I would have gladly paid the $150 to be on Michigan Avenue. Overall, this place was a mess. I did like the customer service at the front desk:they were very polite and helpful. Other than that, the entire hotel is a giant dump that is not even worth 2 stars let alone 4/5!;1;1;0;0;qgpP1FOFrlssColqP2u-xA
145;1/11/2011;BShMTQ1DMPuQ7Er-U-bjSQ;8D3CDu9no5NRquTbYaKVFg;I hop around all of the IHG properties in Chicago while I'm staying here for work, and the Holiday Inn on Harrison came due. The location isn't dreadful, but it certainly isn't close to anything.  There's a Panera, Whole Foods, etc about a 6 block walk, but in January winter and 5" of snow, count me out.  If you have a car, then life is good, otherwise plan on taking a cab to everything. Great fitness center on the top floor, all health club quality Precor equipment, a great multi-machine, and dumbbells up to 50lbs.  Kudos to the General Manager for making the investment here. Rooms are good, very much Holiday Inn but clean and what I need.  I was upgraded to a suite #437, and it's more space than I live in on a daily basis, and has a microwave, fridge, and a flat-panel TV although I don't watch it. Front desk staff is friendly, although check-in took a little longer than I would like due to several people all at once. Room is surprisingly quiet since it's so close to the freeway. Great looking business center on the top floor, looks more like an internet cafe than the typical hotel business center - very nice. I see other reviews talking about the tiny lobby.  I use the lobby for checkin and checkout and don't hang out there, so it's small size doesn't bother me.  I did not experience the families, although I'm also not here during the high season. I did not try the pizza joint attached to the hotel, it has looked pretty empty every time I've passed by the window.  If the GM or anyone from the hotel reads the reviews on TA - The WiFi is pretty slow, and could use a bandwidth upgrade.  Find out whatever the Crowne Plaza on Huron has, and make the investment into the same pipe.  It would also be nice to have coffee in the lobby.

147;9/21/2011;F-3-E6VnwzTIWNDrH2k;OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA;As a single traveler (well, OK, I do have my teddy bear with me), it's hard to sometimes find cost-effective hotels to stay, especially in city centres. I've become more discerning in deciding the important things in a hotel over the years I've been traveling. Where I used to prioritise a swimming pool and not swim, I now look for proximity to public transport and an internet connection. Seneca Suites is an older hotel reflected in its dark wooden decor but its location a block east of the Magnificent Mile is its outstanding feature. It's 4 blocks from the Chicago Red line station. My room was huge - separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. Teddy and I could almost have a room each! Although I ate out on this trip, the kitchen would certainly allow self catering to cut down on costs. I didn't suffer the problems mentioned in other reviews - the water was hot for my showers and the decor wasn't worn out. The free wifi was fast and reliable. There were 2 big TVs with a great range of channels - yup, I was stuck on the Food channel most of the time. Seneca was a bargain for this part of town;4;11;11;8;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
148;8/8/2011;6FE7YIBZP2T0EgA5Zcl6rg;x8fZXFzsCERCcH7g5KkMWQ;Dark but larger rooms in an older converted residential hotel. Bathroom was tight. Had a suite, though never sat in the dark LR. Tiny functional kitchenette, full fridge, lots of small closet space, king bed. Nice location at $160 a night. Relatively clean and quiet. Great for couples or small families on a budget. Money you save on groceries will pay for the $160 room rate.;4;0;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
149;7/18/2008;a1AIpxn2OXX48s9RTmVr7g;wwNs_kMiVEn8V61uqP3ZzA;Rate, location, security and staff were better than the vast majority of hotels I've stayed - which is bunches - I travel for business A LOT. For those that base their vacations on room decor, we may not see eye to eye. I couldn't care less about it, but to describe the room best I'd say  the decor was far from cutting edge (just shy of tacky yet nondescript), the room itself was big and comfortable. It could use new carpet and updated bedding but it had a nice desk, couch, king bed, 3 closets (seemed odd, but whatever) and a kitchenette that was really cutely tucked away within the room. I was very surprised to find a full size fridge, small sized stovetop oven (not that I needed it, but if I were coming over from Europe or anywhere else I'd be very psyched for that as a bonus). We did hear about other people with air conditioning issues with their room:we were totally uneffected. Just in case the room influences that, #1012 is a safe bet. At 129/night, I felt it was a bit of a gamble given this hotel's prime location literally behind the Hancock and kitty corner from Water Tower. You could practically throw a rock at either. I'm originally from Chicago and recently moved out east and was back on business for a week. Trust me, hotels in that location cost at least double. People who live on that block spend more money on their dogs than I will make in my lifetime. This hotel is easily 100/night less than counterparts in this neighborhood. Shopping is pinnacle Michigan Ave, and Oak Street beach is easily walked (a couple blocks). A few things you might not know (if you aren't from there): A neat place to grab a drink is the Hancock. Instead of the observation deck, go up for a cocktail and have the same view while having a nip. Also, on the 600 N. block of St. Clair (about 3 blocks South) is a great little italian place called Coco Pazzo Cafe. Reasonable prices, outdoor seating and outstanding food. If you ask the concierge about it, be sure they direct you to the St. Clair location and not Hubbard (though I'm sure it's just as good, it's not within walking distance). Two more things! Something that really caught me was the security. Nowhere that I've stayed in Chicago has had key entrances near the elevator bank. I thought this feature was a cupcake. Something all the downtown hotels should have everywhere! It gave me an extra bonus sense of security. Lastly, the staff was super friendly and efficient. We left the "do not disturb" sign on our room when we went out for the day and when we got back to the room we had a message on our phone from the head of the cleaning staff letting us know, in the most pleasant tone ever, that they had not cleaned our room so as not to disturb us and to call them if we needed anything(!). In fact, from arrival at the valet, through checkin and at checkout, all staff members were just that - super friendly, and most importantly, efficient. I agree with another reviewer that said this hotel was neither romantic nor trendy, but if you're looking for an attentive, quality hotel experience while adventuring into Chicago (especially if you're interested in the "mag mile"), don't hesitate.;4;3;1;1;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
150;7/15/2008;h4-KSFa6BIFqHJVGap;AJrcowx6W4RGwHqsxnJclQ;"Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: 'Is this the condition that I feared?'" - Seneca the Younger, Ancient Greek Philosopher While Seneca's meditations on the ills of material wealth are inspirational and thought-provoking, they do not give you much solace when you are staying at a hotel which provides fare which can best be described as scanty and cheap.   The service was no exception.  Just one example: I had a reservation for a queen bed, which they would not change to two doubles.  When I arrived, I had in my room what was clearly a full sized bed (smaller than a double sized bed).  When I asked for a room with a queen, or in the alternative, a rollaway bed, the lady at the front tried to argue that it was indeed a queen bed in my room (without looking at it) and refused to bring even a rollaway without a $50 fee.   Seneca would have been proud of the Seneca, but I certainly am not.;1;1;5;3;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
151;1/31/2012;0aKPWmpaHn2iIVfz6fWQ6A;UidLz6LYdq8El8fa7WLTYQ;I stayed here during the summer of '11! It was a fantastic hotel. The restaurants included were also delicious. Although, the breakfast staff were a little rude. However, the staff at the front desk were amazing and so helpful! This hotel was right in the heart of Chicago.

152;6/12/2007;6LiKZEcBhjKI43VIjgxzVQ;_e3X3aoUWwI38Znm09onAQ;My boyfriend and I stayed at The Seneca on New Year's Eve last year. Now, neither of us are fans of NYE--in fact, we *hate* it--but somehow, The Seneca made it so much better. We booked it on priceline or expedia and for $80, we kind of half-expected it to be a little divey, but this place is definately worth every star. It's in a great location, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, the rooms were great, and the best part about them was the little kitchenettes! Awesome! It made for a New Year's Eve fun-filled night of cooking microwave popcorn and baking cookies! I heart you, Seneca.;5;1;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

154;8/12/2008;SKtoHlFhttvHIKJvzzjunQ;tUA34mln_F8aHOEUqCtN2w;*Updated* I was moved to a new renovated room, but I have to remove the second star because the TV does not get NBC at all and I really want to watch the Olympics.  Ridiculous. I hosted my wedding party here during the big weekend, and I thought it was fine then, but my subsequent stay has dashed those initial impressions.  My list: Pro - The Internet actually works decently, although still not terribly fast - Location is great, just off the north end of Michigan Avenue, in a quiet area Con - You MUST ask for a renovated room or else it will be horrible - My bed was U-shaped - TV was grainy and about 18 years old - Build-in kitchen was not very functional, and the refridge was very loud - Headboard moved all over the place at the slightest touch - Sheets were thin - Bottom sheet was not fitted and moved all over the place - Pillows were thin - One of the lamps initially did not have a bulb;1;0;1;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
155;10/7/2011;pcSaIm5Bhqzad4CZYVCbWw;7B9baxzgoVa79dybGCovSQ;A thin veneer of elegance fails to conceal a lot of sloppy upgrades over the years.  Many fixtures in the room were loose (power outlets falling out of the walls, bathtub faucet flopped around), and the furniture was worn.  Understaffed, had to wait unacceptably long to check in due to a guest in front of me having a complicated issue and no other front desk being available to assist other customers while it was resolved.  That said, the room was clean, the location excellent, and we got a great mid-week deal.  Good for the budget-conscious traveler who's not looking for any frills.;3;0;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
156;4/20/2008;7XRczs2buldiGgSgwmjVHw;KiCYxE_3IWWpe0_bwZxeBw;I stayed here upon my arrival when I relocated to Chicago. Heres my .02 for what its worth. My disappointment was that for the money the room was a little rough.  Nice, comfortable, functional, but kinda rundown . In fact, I think the rooms are converted studio apartments for business renters.  The kitchen was fully functional.  It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and lit very badly. The furnishings were also nice, just dated . On the upside, the hotel staff was very nice. The location is great, just east of the John Hancock. Great starting point for any Michigan Ave. day adventure. So if you are looking for  a hotel room with  functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.;4;0;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

The Seneca Hotel offers all three points.  For the location (a block off Michigan Av), other hotels in the area could not match the price of a room for the week-end I needed for my visiting relatives. The room, however outdated and somewhat dark, was clean and had a small kitchenette. The staff was friendly, the bellman very helpful. There are a few parking garages close by if you do not choose to use the hotel parking overnight (saving some money).;4;0;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

And I asked at the front desk if there is anything special with my room and there isn't anything. I just got lucky. If your coming to Chicago and you want to be close to Michigan Ave but you do not want to spend a lot, then you should check out the Seneca.;4;1;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
161;9/11/2010;xi6MTH3ZpVmJt1rLXN3GPQ;vODeKrgSvJt7Kr_cJTxohg;For the price, this place gets five stars! I was blown away by the quality of this hotel and would easily stay here again. PROS -The size of the room was enormous. Giant queen bed, great desk (fantastic, because I had a ton of work to do), enormous closet, bathroom, fully stocked kitchenette with stove, sink, dishes, pans, even a colander, fridge and freezer. Where else can you find that? -The bathtub had a whirlpool!!!! There was also a hairdryer and working heater in the bathroom. I experienced no problems with having tons of hot water for baths and showers. -Two free continental breakfasts. They weren't amazing, but they weren't Costco danishes either. Ham, two eggs, toast, hash browns and coffee. -FREE WIRELESS! And the wireless customer service was great. -Fantastic service all around. They helped me when I lost my key card, remembered me when I came back in and opened the security door for me without my having to swipe my card, gave me a wine bottle opener, let me chill in the lobby, use the internet and do work for two hours after my checkout and were just very helpful and polite. -Quiet room. I had to record several interviews out of my room and each time the audio came out great. CONS -The shampoo and conditioner wasn't great (but then again, is it ever?) A light burned out and so the room wasn't well lit (but I didn't call down to notify them, which is just my laziness.) I also can't judge how good the gym or sundeck were because I was too busy the whole time.;5;1;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

The hotel itself is old and outdated.  We could actually feel holes in the floor boards through the carpeting.  The bed was super uncomfortable.  Not old, just bad.  The TV in the bedroom only had intermittent reception.  One draw back to the location is that it is right next to the Belmont stop of the EL.  All night and especially in the morning we were awoken by the train rumbling by and the voice "This is the Belmont stop, the next stop will be...". Lastly, even though I made my reservation well in advance and had requested a king bed they had none available and we were forced into a double bed.  While I love my husband I was looking forward to just a bit more space.;2;2;0;1;WA6coAKLoKnMWMKYKOibLQ

164;6/19/2011;OIC;G8yY_yeT-UPHZ7lxtsqxZQ;I was pleasantly surprised by City Suites. It has an amazing location, right by lots of restaurants and bars. It took us 10 minutes to walk to Belmont Harbor! I was a little freaked out at first by the proximity to the Red Line station. You can hear the trains all day and night, but I got used to it pretty quickly. Inside the room, the bed linens and amenities were nice. It had a fancy tv and a very well stocked mini bar. They also have 24 hour coffee/tea in the lobby and a nice little continental breakfast. There was also no problem with an early check in as we arrived a lot earlier than anticipated. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating (nice to look at too)!!! The rooms are pretty small which is standard in big cities. We didn't have a lot of room for our luggage (I did overpack though).

The hotel is quaint, boutique-like, and very european. Our room was small and the bathroom was very clean and very art-deco. We didn't need much room as we spent most of our trip out and about. The staff was awesome! Friendly, we never were disturbed, and were even granted a late-check out free of charge. LOCATION was perfect! One couldn't have asked to be any closer to public trans, dining, and nightlife. This hotel is located at Clark/Belmont, borders Wrigleyville, and Lincoln Park. The price was good for what we got. Everywhere else in Chicago was atleast 250$/night. We were here over St. Patrick's Day weekend ( a blackout wkend for most hotels) and paid under $200/night.

I know, I know... you should all cry for me.  There are some hard parts, including staying in a hotel in your own city which boggles the mind a bit, but with a lot of out of town ladies, you roll with the punches and have a blast.   The lobby was small and odd, and for some reason the glass case full of examples of minibar goods cracked me up, but the stay was really a pretty good one.  Our room was big enough for five overnight ladies and a few other pre-dinner party game participants and all the gifts and luggage, and other junk that comes along with a mostly out of town bridal party.   There were many nice touches from the bellman's offer of wine glasses when he noticed we had champagne with us, to the heated bathroom floor, to the extra mini-fridge, not just a minibar full of overpriced crap.  The other great thing was the free continental breakfast which was perfect as we had a long day ahead of us, and many hours before the rehearsal luncheon.   We chose this place for its proximity to our other bachelorette destination and the comparably reasonable prices.  I'd recommend it to people trying to avoid the hubbub and high prices of downtown.;4;3;2;1;WA6coAKLoKnMWMKYKOibLQ

And at this hotel sleep is hard to come by. The main problem is noise.  The walls are thin enough you can hear your next door neighbors TV.  The ceiling creaks from the upstairs occupant just walking around.  And I had the misfortune of staying in the room opposite the elevator so every time the doors creaked open you felt as if people were coming into the room.   I give one star for service... one star for cleanliness... but the stars for comfortable and a good nights sleep I have to withhold.;2;0;0;0;WA6coAKLoKnMWMKYKOibLQ

Travelodge was referred to as the "ghetto" hotel by all the other conference attendees, but I was the only one who GOT FREE INTERNET. Plus, my room was AT LEAST 1/2 the price of what they paid. While not luxurious, it definitely was not a sink hole. I stayed for a week and got to know the staff fairly well. They were friendly and always promptly responded if I needed assistance (like extra coffee or an ironing board). I felt COMPLETELY safe in the hotel and in the surrounding proximity. The hotel is half a block from Lake Michigan and Buckingham Fountain. It's close to the red line, major cta bus routes, and Lou Malnati's pizza. If you call the headquarters to book a room and then find a lower rate, you just fill out a form online and they match the rate PLUS give you a 10% discount. GREAT for people wanting to be IN the heart of Chicago without paying 150-200 dollars per night. With taxes and charges, I spent 7 nights for $600 (on Memorial Day weekend, no less).;3;2;1;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA
177;8/21/2011;69DtfgMghpYufUM;VSnGXIrXTIDXakzl0UP4pw;It's a great location, safe, but you get what you pay for. The rooms are medium sized, stale, old fashioned. The beds and pillows are cheap and old. There are pipes inside the bedrooms and the TVs are CRTs that I didn't know still existed. The windows are 100 years old and have 100 years of paint on them -- not child safe as you can raise them on the 14th floor and climb right out. My bathroom was updated, but my tub had a liner over the old tub which you could feel had a hole in the bottom. AC is a window unit that the maid turns off during the day, so it's stifling when you get back late at night. The maids didn't get to my room until after dinner each night, but they did a good job when they got around to it. No mini fridges. Slowest elevators. Free internet! Nice staff! I paid $170 a night for two twins (we wanted a queen) in late July. There are probably better places for a little bit more, but we took advantage of the walk to the park every single day. It was quiet, probably due to two factors: sturdy construction and unoccupied rooms.;2;0;0;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA
178;7/19/2010;pQCX;OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA;Sigh. What a pity. I was searching for a hotel in the downtown area for my trip to Chicago and Expedia threw up this Travelodge which was almost in the heart of downtown and good subway connections. With such a great location, they should be trying to make the best of it but instead, this hotel seems to have given up competely with any other effort to create a good hotel experience. This started off at check in when they observed the 3pm check in time to the minute. Any classy hotel chain would allow some leeway if the rooms are ready. So there was a huge queue of disgruntled customers all piled up at the desk at 3pm. There seemed to be little effort by the staff to appear helpful or particularly friendly. The room was adequate in a hostel standard type of way. In a way, it was good beause it forced me to get out and explore Chicago more althought I was feeling tired and jetlagged. Thank goodness I was only in Chicago for a night. Like any good Chinese person, I love a good bargain but this place isn't even worth the reduced price I did pay.;2;10;5;6;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA
179;5/2/2010;QpJyOdqWGuuLkIxfphYPqg;f9oD4KWO6gVV_jcFCMHyPg;The only thing which justifies the forced one star us that this place is right off Michigan Ave. There were large roaches in my neighbors room, which made me worry. The piece of what looked like rat's skin in my own rattled me but I was still thinking this is just a hole to crash in at night. I did not freak out till I found that my room's door was not locking at all. I had already left my valuables and gone out running once before I realized it. And I when I realized it, I was on my way for an appointment. When it became clear that I had to choose between leaving my door wide ajar as the handyman fixed it and being 1.5 hours late for my appointment I had just had enough. Plus by now I was convinced that the one thing one looks for in a hole-to-crash is safety, and there was no way I was going to feel safe at this place. I launched orbitz from my phone and booked the closest decent looking hotel, in this case The Essex Inn which was just a block further south. It turned out to be a much better place, at a better price than what I had booked my room at this Travelodge for. However, this was not the end of it. I got gangsta treatment from the guy (wearing the name tag "Ken") at the reception who banged pens and key cards at the desk, was staring at me and generally giving the attitude that he wanted to jump across the counter and grab my neck, and came close to mouthing obscenities and tried big time intimidation by staring. Good riddance to bad rubbish, and I am never going back to this shit hole.;1;3;3;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA

182;7/8/2008;0HzG7CLyMQAeNaZjEVlEWw;CkcO7vmlFzyPuFWk1HNZmQ;I stayed here because this was the hotel the coordinators of the conference I was going to chose for us.  The conference happened at Roosevelt U. just a few blocks away. They will be getting an angry letter from me. I wish I could give this place half a star.  And that's only because it was in a good spot close to the train (we could hear it from our room) and walking distance to some cool stuff.  It's right next to the lake and there's a 24 hour BR across the street which is nice since the hotel has no vending machines with food in them. Reasons why I suggest never staying at this hotel: - Our room was TINY...I think it was meant to be for a queen/king but they shoved two full sized beds in it - There was a 1.5 inch margin between the floor and the bottom of our door...wtf? - The elevators hardly worked and we got to ride the "fun" manual elevator whenever the employees got around to it - Nothing was as clean as it should have been - No one knew anything...we were quoted one price and charged another...we had to negotiate for a compromise All around a bad experience!;1;1;0;1;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA
183;6/16/2009;GW0ZOekga0k4fBj0ncMTXg;adhD-cleHPKoc0Cwx3hAYg;If you see pictures of this place, it doesn't really look that bad, it actually appears to be pretty decent looking... wrong!!!! Really, the only word to describe this "hotel" is DINGY.  It is horribly outdated and although the bathroom looked like an attempt to renovate had been made, the toilet was the kind with the thin metal lever like you would find in a gas station.  The door looked like it had clearly been kicked in at one point and they restuck the chain link on there to make you feel safe... um yeah. which brings me to my major point of contention with this place because sometimes all you really need is a bed to crash in at the end of the day and in that case who cares if it's not the ritz, but I have never felt more unsafe in my entire life!  It truly felt like any minute could have been my last staying in that place.  The windows were small and extremely dirty, the a/c unit turned on and off all night.  Honestly, I would not recommend it and I would never stay here again.   The "upside":  Pretty good location - right off S. Michigan Ave, across from Grant Park (which is beautiful).  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do, including the Sears, restaurants, shops, a trolley tour, etc. The location alone is why it get's that one star.  Also, the parking garage guy is really nice but the whole garage is a little bit of a sketchy scene too... when you go to pick it up in the back, there is this whole pulley system that looks like they drop your car 20 feet underground.  It's a little awkward (also fairly expensive - cost us $65 for 2 nights - which maybe isn't that bad, but we already felt like we were being porked on the crappy hotel).;1;1;0;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA
184;5/1/2010;-KRn2T4Aet2KDEgEE4PkIw;4bdffuUiz7XRYcqbDO11fQ;This hotel has a very European budget feel. However, we are in America. I can handle an old building. What I cannot handle is elevators that do not run properly, are extremely stuffy and slow, and GET STUCK, requiring you to press the call button to be rescued from the elevator by the maintenance crew. This hotel has 2 modern elevators and 1 manual elevator. Why they still have a manual elevator is beyond me, but thank god for that thing because during my stay only 1 of the modern elevators was ever running, and when we got stuck in it the manual elevator aided in our rescue mission. Only staff can run the manual lift, so that meant that all guests across 12 floors were using 1 elevator. This created a big hassle and long waits to get to and from your room (we were on the 12th floor - stairs not really an option). I also just did not feel safe in the elevators. The location is great, staff are nice and competent (expect for the housekeeper - she was rudeness to the max), wi-fi is free, and luckily our room was quiet. But the furnishings are very cheap and outdated. The double beds are just doubles, not queen size. And housekeeping would only give us 1 roll of toilet paper at a time. We had 4 people in the room! Needless to say we ran out of toilet paper each day of our stay. Also, we had a suite with a "kitchenette," but there was really nothing that you could do in this kitchenette other than store leftovers in the fridge, heat them up in the microwave, and then eat them with your bare hands. There was no silverware, plates, glasses, nothing - just some paper cups. So if you want to take advantage of the "kitchenette" you'll have to bring the same type of gear you'd bring on a picnic. I expect more from a national chain!;2;0;0;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA

I read some of the previous reviews about being 'harsh' and 'you get what you paid for' etc...That's understandable with cosmetic issues and outdated upholstry and stuff.  But this was no excuse why our TV had one blurry channel, our toilet was leaking the whole time so there was constantly a trail of water, both lights above both beds did not work (yes they were plugged in), our couch was covered in stains and hair, and our view was of a hideous run down building that looked like a murder scene out of 'Saw'.  Oh and the beds--oh my God, those BEDS! SOOO uncomfortable!!  I woke up feeling like I got beat up from the rock hard mattress, the pillows were about as comfortable as sleeping on a balled up paper towel (and are unusually small for hotel pillows, they looked like decorative throw pillows), and you may as well slept on the floor, it would have felt the same, but you would have had more room to stretch out.  The beds are clearly not made for couples. It's an old building, we get it, but some of these things were unexcuseable.  The whole hotel needs a serious facelift, and TV's that aren't from 1987 and still need to have the antennas adjusted to get a semi-clear channel.;2;1;0;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA

Dumpy rooms, extremely slow elevators (although on my first trip down the elevator DID try to speed my trip up by coming to a complete stop and then dropping a floor or so), and uncomfortable bed/furniture. I'm not even sure it's worth staying here for the location, at least not if you're planning on evening activities. The lack of activity on this part of Michigan Avenue after dark makes it feel very unsafe and uncomfortable. The next time I'm in Chicago I'll cough up a bit more dough and stay in a slightly more upscale joint.;1;0;0;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA

I was sent to Chicago for a week for work and this hotel was recommended for being relatively centrally located and cheap...and it is indeed both of these things. The style of the hotel could be called "tired" by some, but I would call it American Traditional. Wood is dark, ceilings vaulted, etc. I've stayed in the "Ice Room" in the W in Hollywood, but I actually enjoyed coming back to the Congress every evening more than I enjoyed the modern ultra-hip vibe. There was something cozy about it, and that's important to me because I travel for work fairly frequently, and often on my own too. The only con was the service. Workers aren't very friendly or helpful, and the room service food is overpriced and downright bad. I went to Panera for breakfast every morning as it is located around the corner. Also, the fact that you had to pay for internet was annoying. You pay by the 24 hours and they are consecutive, meaning if you use it for 10 minutes and then use it for 10 minutes 25 hours later, you pay twice.;4;0;0;0;QnWFR5zQuLGL12EM_SZb8Q

194;8/7/2012;mHTf52zF9rRGs0HXRr9Jcg;P5zLmBp4N6cbVi0IREveCA;I stayed here several years ago and was not impressed by anything but the location, which is on Michigan avenue and its cheap(er) price.  It was New Year's Day and we were happy and surprised to have found the room.  Though it is far from the main tourist drag up north, it is next to two art museums: the Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Photography. It's also close to State Street, and a few blocks from the lake.  Thus the two stars. More recently I went here for a wedding.  Must have been a great cheap deal. I must have stayed here a long time ago, because this place has really gone down from even the basic quality I remembered. The first thing you get to see is a bunch of strikers picketing.  A few people at the reception were grumbling about having to cross that line, and I heard later that was because they were union themselves.  I was told that to cross a picket line is an insult against the strikers and makes a particular political statement. Despite the strike, which apparently has been going for a while (their strike signs looked worn)  the place is operating, but not fully.  There was an escalator going up to the hall that did not work.  There were toilets that did not work and were covered with plastic.  You could tell these items had been not functioning a while.  The place could have been cleaner, maybe it just needed some paint.  The food at the reception was ok, but even in the dimmed lights you could see that even the mashed potatoes had been made carelessly: they were dark and oxidized.   Just a small careless error, a detail, but it was another piece in the puzzle. They could have tried harder. Congress neglects  their building the details and apparently their employees too. Overall, I'd describe the place as worn and depressing.   Someone should buy this place and fix it up:take advantage of its location.  Has potential.  As they say in real estate "fixer upper".  Needs some TLC.;2;1;0;0;QnWFR5zQuLGL12EM_SZb8Q

After being spoiled by 5 star places in the last year, I was not expecting much from a Hilton Garden Inn, but I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was nicely done, and the front desk was speedy, friendly, and efficient. The rooms were nice sized, with very comfy beds, and clean modern updated bathrooms. They even had a mini fridge and microwave. Our air-conditioning vent was directed right at my face the first night and kept waking me up, but after arranging the curtains and blocking it with a pillow the second night, it was much better. Parking was valet only and was around $40 a night, which is in line with everything else in the area.

That being said, watch out for the homeless people that prey on tourists over here after dark. Lol. That aside, the hotel itself is good. I mean, it's standard. Now that I've been living in Chicago for the past few years I have been to way nicer hotels, but for the price and the location, the Hilton Garden Inn has much to offer. The pool is very clean and the business center is completely accessible. The service was good and everyone was pretty friendly. Even at 5 AM when we checked out, the person on duty was very attentive and helpful. Also, I need to add that the Weber Grill attached to the building is definitely tastey and convenient. As far as I know, the Hilton Garden Inn does not offer as many local discounts as some of the other Hilton hotels in the area (like the Palmer House). It is nicely decorated, but isn't by any means any competition to the Wit, James, Palmer House, Drake, etc. I wasn't disappointed with this hotel at all and it offered some pretty fantastic views of downtown Chicago.;4;0;1;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

201;12/20/2009;soNBW68U0hFtw6llNy5NPg;LZPtLWnjGZVODlhZk_uPdg;For it's location and it's price, the Hilton Garden Inn is not a bad place to stay. Located a few blocks from Chicago's Magnificent Mile, and also walking distance to other shops and dining options, where can you go wrong, right? Well, for one...because of all the above, I am sure lots of families like to stay there as was apparent by my neighbors and the sounds of their kids, the cartoons, and the occasional loud conversations either on the phone or just generally to each other.  I am sure the hotel can't do anything about this, but I'm just saying. Also, I am usually an easy going traveler with no specific requests for my room other than a queen/king-size bed.  But, I would appreciate that if I did not request for a handicapable room, you do not put me in a handicapable room.  I am sure it could have been put to better use.  And although I am aware that I could have asked for another room, I had already unpacked my items before I had realized this.  And to be fair and honest (and NOT mean), I just was not very comfortable in the bathroom as it was made for the handicapable (the toilet seats where rather high....I am particularly short), and the shower just a shower (like gym showers) to make it more accomodating for wheelchairs and such. And one more odd thing....what hotel still has a "13th" floor?  I know it's just superstition, but that still creeped me out a bit....cause that was my floor. Aside from that, the staff (front desk and bell men) were extremely friendly and helpful, and I loved how the moment you checked in you had an option to get 2 small bottles of water or 1 large one....complimentary.  I always hated those $4 bottle of waters other hotels try to force on you cause they know you'll be thirsty by the time you get to your room.;3;2;0;1;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

Everyone spoke to me and went out of their way to ensure a quality stay. I even got to experience the event staff, as my business was conducted in the hotel's meeting space. The Food & Beverage service is five-star, and the guest room accommodations are top knotch. I will definitely stay here when I return to Chicago. Great location, great property.;5;1;0;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ
205;4/30/2008;wGFf-g0mcsI9lMeWsOi8Jg;kaG2Va1ee7YyRy-TB9Lulg;We decided to take a weekend and pretend we were tourists, hotel, museums, whole bit.  We found a reasonable deal at the Hilton Garden by checking prices and waiting until the day before to book the room.  It has a great location (grand and state) right by the Red Line L.  We were close to everything we could ask for.  The room was really spacious and all their beds are Sleep Number beds now, so its fun to play around with that.  There are a ton of families, usually coming to and from the pool, so we were never alone in the elevator.  Which inhibited us from getting the token "mirrored ceiling in the elevator pic."   In your room you'll find a menu of places that deliver, and you MUST order from the breakfast delivery place.  It's a RELIGION, and the true way to a woman's heart is good breakfast delivery. Well... this woman, anyway.;4;0;1;1;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

I was able to check into my own room at the same time, so they gave us two adjoining rooms.  I'd booked one of their "junior suites," which turned out to be AMAZING - a huge corner room with a murphy bed, a full living room, a bar, and a kitchenette.  Add in my friend's room next door and we basically had a two-bed, two-bath living space that was bigger than a typical apartment.  The corner room had a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago, and I snapped a lot of photos at different times of day and night of all of the iconic tall buildings.  The murphy bed was pretty cool and actually quite comfortable for something that also folds into the wall!  I've stayed in fancier hotels, but this place takes the prize for a truly fantastic room. I had breakfast every morning at the Weber Grill, which has a pretty typical buffet to offer.  The hotel is close enough to a variety of convenience stores and supermarkets that you can stock up on some basics and keep them in the room.  I really liked the location and got a great deal on that suite when I stayed there.  I always check the prices when I'm coming back to Chicago.;4;0;0;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ
208;5/10/2009;rxhD5;3HXx5EwIUGJOjM2apA7zjw;During a weekend getaway to the Windy City, my brother and I needed a cheap place to crash after our sight-seeing.  We figured a Hilton hotel in the heart of Chicago would be a safe bet.  We were wrong. The service and staff were top notch. The location was good.  Quick access to the subway.  Millennium Park and Navy Pier about ten minutes away.  All positives. However, the room was were things fell apart.  I agree with many reviewers that the walls were paper thin.  Very annoying.  Also, the ventilation was poor.   All in all, the room was a major downer. The price online seemed a good value.  However, after you add the cost of parking per day (not included) and the not-so great room, I felt ripped off. 2 out of 5 and recommend looking elsewhere.;2;0;0;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ
209;9/9/2009;ei0caOH--uZk53YlkStwQg;nEEDPo_Uht4OoW6A-jS1ng;I recently stayed here for just one night, but I gotta say that Hilton Garden Inn's always impress me.  It might be because some people have a notion that the Garden Inn line of Hilton is their inferior brand.  I've stayed at several and they are actually better than some of the standard Hiltons.  I think it might be because most of them are newer properties. And yes, I am giving them 5 stars.  I know, I know!  It's not a luxury hotel like the Ritz or Four Season, but for a nice, newer hotel in the area that caters more towards a business crowd, it is one of the best I've been to. The lobby was really nice and modern and they are attached to Weber Grill restaurant that offers room service.  The check in was quick and the woman was super friendly and helpful. The room was great.  It was a corner room on a higher floor with nice city views to both directions.  The room was clean, had nice linens and decor, and also features a mini-refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.  I love having those conveniences in a hotel room.  The bathroom amenities were Neutrogena. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.  You are just blocks to Michigan Avenue in the heart of the River North neighborhood.  You are also just blocks to the Loop just across the river.  Oh, and all that for just $145 a night.  Great price for the area and the quality.  I would definitely stay there again.;5;0;0;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

213;5/25/2010;V6pzVVtysiYrWaVk9yWZNA;-MQPWNRr3O4PVD2qBul05Q;I love Hilton properties.  I just do. The best thing about this hotel is the pool.  The first 2 nights I was there, it was closed for maintenance, which was a disappointment, but when they reopened it, it was IMMACULATE.  Gorgeous, gorgeous pool.  It's not big enough to do laps or anything like that, but the whole set-up is very clean, very open feeling, well lit, and relaxing feeling.  One does not often find hotel pools this nice.  I intend to stay here again when I go back to Chicago for the pool experience.   Also, the room service is great.  the food comes from the Weber Grill restaurant downstairs and is very good.   My one issue is that I think there was a ghost of some sort who lived behind my walls and ceiling who made clicking noises at all hours.  If the ghost would have just shut up and let me sleep, the trip would have been more enjoyable. Oh, and also, the Grand train station is right there, which is super convenient.;4;1;0;1;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

I'm still not sold on the Garden Inn adjustable beds, but aside from that it is clean, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the breakfast is hot and made to order. Within an easy walk or short cab ride of anything you want to do downtown, this hotel is affordable and suitable for business travelers or families on vacation.;4;0;0;0;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ
217;5/22/2009;OfYmk8U5NT7i2E2R9lM1TA;uqdUPWJVsdWzDHnILxey_g;The location is great. I use the red line frequently so you can't beat the entrance that's about 6 steps away from the hotel.  They also provide free internet in the rooms! No extra/hidden charges like Hyatt.  The staff and service was fantastic, the people were more than willing to help you out however they could. The walls are thin and sound certainly travels through the bathroom vents, as some have mentioned, but it's a hotel.. It happens. Also the elevators do run slowly during peak times. There's only three for a 25+ story hotel, which is definitely one short of the optimal amount, but expect it going in and it won't ruin your stay. The bed.. It's got that strange comfort foam stuff, which is cool, but I found that it doesn't bounce back very quickly, so I'd have to alternate sleeping on different sides of the bed. Not a huge deal, but for people who have trouble sleeping they might want to do some more research into that.;4;3;3;3;SfRCNiCTPfGwzHEM_hCVZQ

220;9/16/2012;2pYM8pbusmgM723M8Ig1Pw;8kgQupO4TS2bpCGSPhTTIg;Wow. Worst hotel experience of my entire life. I arrived here around 9:45 on a Tuesday night. I had to be up early the next morning and was just looking for a place to grab dinner, store my stuff, and catch a good nights sleep before a long days of work. Upon arrival (at the self proclaimed 3 star hotel) I was disappointed to find that it was in a not-so-nice part of town. However, I quickly got over the fact because all I was looking for was a bed to sleep on. When I got to my room, changed, and left to grab food, I noticed the door to my hotel room would not lock from the outside. I called the front desk and asked to either be switched to another room or to have someone come fix it. Unfortunately, the handy man didn't arrive until 11:30... which meant I was sitting in my room, awake, foodless, waiting for him to arrive. After he came it took him an hour to fix my door. I wrote an angry letter to hotel management the next day and got the room comped for the night. However, I was pretty upset because I wasn't able to sleep very well, which definitely affected my performance at work the next day. Anyways... all things considered I will probably avoid the Chicago South Loop hotel the next time I'm around... and I recommend everyone else do the same.;1;0;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

We arrived hours before check in hoping to find parking which was very limited (due to the event) but we lucked out in the parking lot which thankfully was FREE!! Check in went great and the room was as expected.  I am not sure why some of the reviews complained about that- you pay for what you get? If you want luxury and high class you pay for it right? I thought the staff was great...they helped us with directions and check out was super easy.  We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Again!   GO Hawks!;4;0;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

Beautiful lobby:staff was great and room was clean and very big. I am not a nit picky person so I did not find anything to nit pick about. Maybe if I was staying at a $200 a nite hotel, it would be different. But again, for the money, this hotel can't be beat.

The parking is free but no1 checks if people from the souring areas use it. We went for a late dinner downtown and went we got back we didnt have parking... I had to wait for 45 min for some random spot to open and I had to rush because they were other 3 cars looking for space!!!!! I went back took a shower watch a bit of TV and then look to the parking lot from the window and one of the cars was still waiting (~3am). We woke up early (I dont sleep much) and the parking lot was almost empty by 9 am.... I wasnt too happy about this... Otherwise, is cheaper than downtown...;2;1;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

Its proximity to the El is great for getting around Chicago, but not great if noise bothers you.;3;0;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
225;9/21/2009;e9TfeCKLVk9g3miwzVFVHA;TvRqHTHzTRLry_4u2nafAA;Casing out hotels for my recent trip, I found out about the Chicago South Loop Hotel and liked the idea of an affordable boutique hotel in an up-and-coming neighborhood.  Unfortunately, the South Loop Hotel has jumped the gun by about five years.  New construction is happening but not in a block-by-block or district manner, but rather on random corners and lots throughout South Chicago.  As a result of this, the neighborhood in which SLH resides is not very walkable and doesn't have any retail shops, cafes or anything really to speak of that SLH guests can easily access.   In order to really experience Chicago while staying here, you'll be forced to cab it.  When staying at the SLH, you will do yourself a favor if you store the Chicago Carriage Cab Company's phone number in your cell phone (312-326-2221).  Their depot is literally one block to the west.  When calling the Carriage Cab folks, they'd arrive within five minutes and I was on my way.  Based on SLH's location, McCormick Place (for conferences) and Chinatown are the biggest draws that are closest...pretty limited pickings of what Chicago has to offer. Aside from its location, SLH is also less than satisfactory.  SLH doesn't promise alot of amenities on their website, but they didn't carry through on some of the things that they did state.  The most annoying of these was their lack of internet access.  According to their website, they have net access, but neither room or business center access existed.   Also, the walls were pretty thin, but this was tempered by the fact that not many guests were staying there.  The west side of the hotel is backed up to the El and the windows did little to reduce the passing train cars' noise.  Over time the El started to sound like a waterfall or a river, not the most bothersome of sounds.  Even their television channel selection was poor.  There are more disappointing things to mention, but the aforementioned are more than enough things to help you make an informed hotel decision.  The only service that was good was their housekeeping staff.  They did a lot of stuff for us that wasn't prompted and asked for, but ended up being really useful for us.   After a couple of days, we moved on to better digs.  While my review may make SLH sound like the worst hotel ever, it's just that I've definitely experienced much better.  If you have a conference coming up and you want to save some dollars on a bare bones hotel, this can fit your bill.  I definitely would not endorse staying here on their regular price.  Get a reservation on Hotwire or something similar.  That way, you can live with yourself for choosing the CSLH.;2;3;2;1;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
226;12/17/2009;EXx;PO5YZUaLpAxqZ_cyp8tERg;I have to agree with the other reviewers. I would have loved staying at this hotel if I were on a high school or college road trip (its the cheapest hotel you can find this close to downtown), but as a professional adult there is no way in the world I would stay here again. Unlike what one reviewer said - there is a day spa, but its hard to find. It's the Kimberly Coleman Salon, which is located in the hotel (great salon by the way! see my review about that). The "gourmet coffee" snack people are horrible. The food isn't bad, but the coffee sucks and is way overpriced. The hotel lobby is nice. Its obviously new. But the rooms.... the rooms... the rooms....................are completely bare-boned, nothing extra. It looks like the furniture came from the 1980's, the TV channel selections suck, and worst of all.... the bed was hard as a rock. I'm not kidding!! I couldn't sleep on it. I pulled my air mattress out of the car and slept on that!!!! If you are planning to stay here for a convention, family reunion, church revival whatever - make sure to book using http://Hotels.com or something. As everyone has already said - this place is not worth the price if you pay the full value. http://Hotels.com had it for $79 per night when I booked - the hotel wanted $139. NO WAY!;2;2;0;1;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

Yes, it IS a little bit out of the way (~20-30 minutes by train to downtown) and the nearest subway station is about a 10 minute walk. (Carmak-Chinatown of the Red Line). However, the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, well-maintained and spacious, and the hotel itself is upscale, clean and gorgeous to look at. I would recommend staying here. I would not recommend walking around the neighborhood after midnight by yourself, but my female friend and I walked home at 11 pm on two brightly lit, busy streets with no problem or harrassment. Some additional information about the hotel: 1. Helpful front desk. Want pizza delivered to your room at 4 am? No problem. They have menus for Sarpino's, a delicious pizza delivery place nearby. There's also a menu in room for Chinese food. They also called a cab for me at 4 am for the airport. 2. Huge lobby, bar, restaurant and general store for supplies you may have forgotten. 3. Business center with computers and Internet and a printer for use. Free coffee in the business center. 4. Huge rooms, comfortable beds, HUGE bathtub. 5. Friendly housekeepers. 6. 10 minute walk to Chinatown and nearest subway stop. 7. Bus stop right in front of hotel. (#29 bus) 8. Taxi stand in front of hotel. 9 Free wifi in rooms. And it was fast! Much appreciated! I very much enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again. The only downside is that it's further away from central downtown Chicago.;4;6;1;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

230;4/19/2009;wiWXggmVev6gmPQ4Shsqxg;omaBpeBqfchJu4Ds7dubgg;Gah... I booked this place on Hotwire, which says it's a 3 star hotel.  No, it's not.  The restaurant doesn't exist yet (but it will Real Soon Now (tm)!), the coffee shop doesn't keep open the hours they have posted, and the whole place just feel abandoned. Let's talk about the "services" that are on their webpage: Continental Breakfast: No sight of it! Day Spa Services: Where? 24 Hour Fitness Center: There's a room with a treadmill and an exercise cycle. Gourmet Coffee Shop: ... There's a place that serves coffee.  Their hours are awful (and disagree with what they post), and the food isn't "gourmet" at all.  It's mostly packaged stuff they heat up for you at a premium.  Oh, and if you have any questions about it, the staff will gladly tell you that the coffee shop is a separate company and they have no idea about it. Gift Shoppe / Art Gallery: Worse hours than the coffee shop.  I've been here for three days, and I haven't seen it open yet. Meeting & Banquet Facilities: no idea. 24 Hour Business Center & Free Wi-Fi: There's a room with some computers and some printers.  The wi-fi is free, when it's working.  Unfortunately the staff know less about it than they do the coffee shop, and can only suggest using an ethernet cable (which they will provide, also free) if you have any problems. Limousine Services: They have the number for a limo company up front, yes. Wedding and Tour Packages: I've got nothing. Ample Parking: True.  This is because the place is abandoned, you and the other guest at the hotel have your choice of many spaces. Along with all of that, the staff seem like they're just off their game.  None of the rooms (I've unfortunately seen more than one) are well cleaned, and the hallways and common areas (except for the lobby) are in worse shape than the rooms.  It looks like there's been a fresh coat of paint by someone who lost interest before they finished (areas where the paint just... stops...). At the rate they're charging (~$140/night with tax), there's no way this is worth it.  At the hotwire rate ($60/night including tax), well, it's better. Finally, the area of town it's in is kind of sketchy.  It's close to Chinatown, and I expected to walk there for food and whatnot.  The staff strongly advised me against making that walk in the evenings or night time.  I did once at night, a bunch of times during the day, and it was fine.  However, I'm a large dude, and others might be less comfortable with it.  Once you get into Chinatown it's fine, but between here and there is a bit shady. I get the feeling that this hotel just isn't doing well enough to survive.  I overheard the staff saying that they had something like 50 rooms full this weekend.  That's close to 1/5 full.  Ouch...;2;6;1;3;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
231;1/18/2010;KOtgT6wQzWdpTUS7Vu6xdA;ikXZmqzP1-AmBZ12jKXNvg;i consider this hotel like the old bait and switch scam. it's called the chicago south loop hotel.  so i assumed it would be somewhere near the loop.  it is about a 15-20 minute bus ride south from the loop.   it claims to be a "boutique" hotel, which it is totally nothing like. the first night we rode in on the train and took the bus over to the hotel.  as we got further and further away, we asked a passenger next to us where to hotel was and if we could get something to eat nearby.  he suggested not trying to walk anywhere at that time of day  in that neighborhood and to just order pizza.  our first not so great sign. the hotel itself is like in nowhere land.  there is nothing within like 3 city blocks of this place. on http://hotels.com it is described as 3stars and the amenities included free wifi, continental breakast, a bar and restaurant and a internet/business center.  my friend michelle and i only got to use two of these, the others we found to be missing. the business room was two computers with internet and a copier from 1996.  they even wanted to charge for computer use. the bar was closed at 10pm the first night we arrived and was never open when we wanted to have a cocktail. the only good things we found was the bus stop directly across and chinatown is very close. i would have given more stars, if the website and description wasn't a total lie. because really, the hotel is a little bare bones, but it's fine for cheapness and just sleeping while enjoying the city.  i was really unhappy with the fog and mirrors in the description though. love, juston;2;3;1;1;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
232;8/20/2009;RIHj7A7pye;XKtW5jAYGlUm0zB-sJTMbw;The reason I am giving it 3 stars is my housekeeper was amazing.  She was there outside my room every morning and I could get anything I wanted towels what not.  When I first arrived I didn't have a do not disturb sign.  She was just walking down the hall and I caught her and she returned with one in no time. On the other hand the food establishment inside the hotel was lousy.  They cooked everything on Coleman camp stoves and hot plates plus it took over 45 min for a breakfast sandwich. On Monday when I got back to my room my key no longer worked.  So I had to go stand in line at the front desk. It seemed there was always a wait at the front desk. If you stay here make sure to get your reservation on http://hotels.com or Travelocity or what ever your favorite travel site is.  It will be cheaper than calling them.  I called just to ask about getting the same price they said they couldn't which I found odd.  But hey what ever floats their boat.  The price was very good for staying in Chicago plus free parking.  Our tab was $82 a night. It was near china town which was great because I love chinese food.  Plus it was only like a 10 min walk to the red line which I used during my whole trip.;3;2;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
233;8/2/2009;XnI2xKMUAkYcW5XSTyBSKg;0CPgZHlqXUg013MJ9tZMiw;This hotel is located in a total wasteland in the middle of nowhere. There are vacant lots on three out of four sides. There are no businesses  within walking distance in any direction. There is no pedestrian traffic outside at any hour. If you don't believe us, check out Google Street View for this block. It gives you a VERY accurate sense of what this neighborhood is like. The people who work at this hotel seem to fall into two categories: rude+incompetent and nice+overworked+incompetent. The woman who checked us in when we first arrived was screaming at one of the hotel guests on the phone so loudly that it could be heard throughout the first floor. (She seemed to be trying to convey to them that their pizza had arrived. Why this required screaming we're not sure, but the tone she took with them was more than a little inappropriate.) The internet didn't work.  Neither the ethernet nor the Wi-Fi.  Their website advertises that they have free internet in ALL rooms. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel since we were here on business and needed it for work . We called down to see if they could resolve the issue. The woman at the front desk said, "I'm not IT and it's a free service." At $109/night (still overpriced "discount" travelocity rate) we did not think any of the very basic amenities could reasonably be considered "free":I mean, the bed was free too, right?  Needless to say she did not resolve the issue, although the next night someone else at the front desk was kind enough to let us test other rooms. Dragging our computers with us from one floor to the next, we tried three separate rooms before we found one where the internet actually worked. We then repacked all of our stuff and switched rooms. When we came back the next evening we were locked out of our new room for some reason and had to go to the front desk to get our keycards reactivated. Apparently this had happened to several other guests as well. So how is the rest of the hotel? One word comes to mind: basic. Industrial-pile carpeting, hard and horribly uncomfortable mattresses that seem to be covered with some sort of plastic underneath very starchy and coarse sheets, lousy water pressure, no place to put your stuff in the bathroom, no full length mirror. We didn't have a "Do Not Disturb" sign in our room so housekeeping woke us up at 8:50 am on a Sunday morning. When we sent them away so that we could get dressed before they did up the room, they never came back and consequently we had to do without towels that day. There was such a disconnect between what we experienced with this hotel and what we'd read in some of the reviews that we wondered if maybe people had gotten it confused with some other hotel. The best thing about this hotel by far is the parking. The parking is free and convenient. There are pretty much always spots available. Other than that...;2;4;0;1;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
234;7/1/2011;TgfCIsbADkZRaExapBQSGQ;ffLz8EMxRowdeL0pt5YDWA;So a month later, the issue with my sister's missing ipod touch was finally resolved.  It took more phone calls and emails over the ensuing weeks before anyone finally contacted me, which I still find annoying, but the manager claims that they did look into the issue and speak with the housekeeper, who of course denied everything.  Whatever.  All I know is they sent my sister a gift card to the apple store to replace her ipod touch so the issue is finally resolved, but I still would not stay there again.;2;0;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag

Very live bar in the main lobby area. George Clinton was even staying there when we were there. The neighbor hood is a bit ruff, however it looks like they are trying to redo the area. But the public transportation is right out the door bus is only 2 steps from door. I will be staying again great price right down town. NICE;4;0;0;0;Y4wBzuFAMwJM2WymFEdmag
236;6/16/2011;bzwoV3YnMZj3mfxyZnsiLQ;AuY12hD6yXCcjrYy-09FJw;Shockingly bad service. I booked one of my salesmen for a three night conference here. I booked over the phone for him, and I have the gentlemen at the front desk the salesmen's contact information should the need arise. He briefly told me the times of check-in, but I didn't note them as being anything unusual. Come to find out, check-in here is between the hours of 3pm and 6pm EXPRESSLY. If you don't check in during those times, they lock the doors and their system cancels your reservation. My salesman's flight didn't even get in until 8pm, so color him surprised when he shows up to a darkened porch and a locked door. Jorge, the manager on-site came to open the door after a certain amount of noise was made and let him in begrudgingly. He told him he was late and that they assumed he wasn't coming. They couldn't call to check? To make matters worse, on my salesmans 3rd day, he returned to the hotel to find Jorge waiting for him with bad news. Because he checked in late and his reservation was cancelled, they had double-booked the room. The couple waiting to check-in to his room was currently waiting in the bar. He was given 20 minutes to pack and get out. When he asked Jorge to call him a cab, Jorge told him that cabs don't come to that area and that he would have to walk four blocks to catch a cab or a bus. HONESTLY! My salesman is a better person than I as he handled it with grace, but I am furious over the way he was treated and how the situation was handled. It's a shame too, because the space is gorgeous and we would probably use it again if it weren't for the ludicrous business habits of the staff. Stay away unless you plan to play by their crazy rules and pay their crazy prices.;1;4;0;1;gAZVMESj-7Va8zntfZCvNQ

238;7/31/2012;Zzt4smy-p-LDcFcYNY;0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w;This review is for the Manager Reception:   Embassy Suites has the best deal in the hotel industry. It is the Manager's Reception. What the Manager's Reception is, is a 2-hour Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 P.M. With a hotel key, hotel guests have unlimited alcohol beverages at no cost from 5:30-7:30 P.M. plus snacks. The alcohol drinks range from draft Budweiser to Bahama Mamas and Blue Hawaiins (my favorite). All drinks are served by personable bar tenders. And not only are there drinks, there are  snacks. My favorite is the tri-color tortilla chips with salsa (served on certain days).  I rate the Manager Reception 5 stars. If you are having a bad day, by two hours the Manager's Reception should change your bad day into a great night.;5;1;0;1;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
239;7/29/2012;k1RCNZvcmJ2dFv9Gekq;SlTYV-GNvy8bI4136g3--g;Came here for a bachelorette party and it more than met our needs.  The rooms were well sized, especially in order to accommodate our entire party.  The biggest bonus areas for this hotel is the cocktail hour and breakfast served in the morning.  Though they give cards for both these times, in our experience none of the bartenders checked for them before serving the beverages, meaning we could get back in line again and again for a new, fun cocktail.  Fabulous!  The breakfast was similar.  It had a great amount of choice, from hot eggs, bacon, pancakes and potatoes, to cereal, breads, muffins, oatmeal and then made-to-order omelettes, as well as biscuits and gravy.  Though, it's important to take note that the made-to-order line can get extremely long, especially on weekends and later in the mornings.  If you don't want to wait, go early on stay during weekdays.   Only complaint here is the noise that can be heard from inside the hotel room.  Because the entire hotel is set up around a large atrium, any activity in the lobby, or any hallway can be heard from inside the rooms.  For a light sleeper, this can cause some issues, so sleepers beware. Otherwise, this hotel was a great deal for all of the perks they offer and somewhere I'd definitely stay again, especially for a girl's night or weekend.;4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
240;9/16/2012;9HP;DdkiQ8aJO68OotgjH5bgvw;First off about my perspective in reviewing this hotel.  I love value and convenience.  I hate lines and crowds.  I am also a fan of Embassy Suites, so I am taking into consideration my stays at other E.S. properties. We stayed here for the final two nights of our family vacation trip, and I picked this hotel for its central location in downtown Chicago, the free breakfast, and the overall price / value compared to other nice hotels in the area. When we arrived it was a little confusing.  After parking in the public parking garage (E.S. does not have its own parking, although you can do valet), and taking the elevator to the Embassy Suites / street level.  Around the corner was the bell / valet counter, and then around the corner from that was another elevator to take up to the lobby level.  Although the atrium is huge, the front desk area is actual somewhat cramped when waiting in a long line to check-in.  Finally, 20-25 minutes after parking we were able to take the third elevator ride up to the room.   The room itself  was spacious and comfortable , with a set-up typical of an Embassy Suites.  It is a huge hotel with a vast atrium in the middle.  Overall this is a nice property.   One of my favorite things about Embassy Suites is the free, made to order breakfast, however, the first morning, going down to breakfast, I was frustrated to see a massive line for the made to order.  So I decided to forego it and just do the buffet.  There was a good selection and the food was fine, although finding a table was a challenge.  My oldest son did wait in line for a omelet -- took over 20 minutes.  The next morning I made it a point to get up early:the line was shorter, but still almost took 15 minutes.  Interesting, also, the helper asked about what sides you wanted, and put them on a plate before the omelet was started, so they were cold before the omelet was finished.  Along the same lines, we went down for the evening reception, and the line for drinks was just as bad as the omelet line  -- not worth it to me, considering the idea of having a drink is to relax -- waiting in line for 15 minutes is not relaxing.  Perhaps the hotel is too big for every thing Embassy Suites promises. A couple other things.  I will never understand why I can pay $59 at a Super 8 and get free wi-fi, but a $250 hotel needs to charge $15 / day -- not per room, but per device (we decided internet could wait).  Also, we heard voices from other rooms while in our room. Overall, the stay was fine, but for what we paid, I did not consider it a great value.;3;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
241;3/11/2012;bNoFDguT9BdIrDb1TxsEcg;Mt31ShDTsvPfjKoTsFJmbQ;I have stayed here a few times and my experience has been mixed. On the plus side, the hotel has a gorgeous lobby, with great views of the city around it.  It feels bright and open, much more so than most cookie cutter Embassy Suites. The rooms (suites) are nice and standard, and staff has been courteous and helpful on all occasions.  The pool that is right off the lobby is nice, as is the jacuzzi. On the minus side, the lines for breakfast can be atrocious, especially on weekend mornings when families stay at the hotel.  I am talking about 20 or 30 minutes buffet lines - forget about ordering a custom breakfast.  You really need to be there at 7 AM to avoid the lines, but that means you need to alter your schedule to account for the hotel's inability to handle a crowd.  The same is true of the evening reception - lines of 15, 20, 30 people to order a drink - frustrating. So I can recommend the hotel, but if the complimentary amenities are a reason for choosing this hotel, be prepared to dedicate extra time.;3;3;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
242;7/10/2012;vPG-V3jZqbHPYfDve5D;JbcE_GFsuZ7_AAEBSKzL6Q;Going to Chicago on a weekday makes life better. We stayed here and no lines for drinks at the reception.

243;4/22/2012;1Ag6zx0AR9YkMjIX7O4IAw;hTzw0SH3Ksdki76B9L14GQ;Great visit to the Embassy Suites. The staff were incredibly friendly, the food was quite good, and the room was clean and comfortable.

244;2/2/2012;A54vhGdyZerGPNi09R3y;Xlc2khTEd0gjKcQmWOakhw;We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location was great. It was within walking distance to most everything: Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due. We had a beautiful view looking over toward the river and the Wrigley Building. I stay at Embassy Suites whenever I can and find them to be consistent in quality where ever they are. This location was no exception. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. The hotel staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. We had a wonderful stay.;4;1;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
245;6/25/2012;0AqtWHFZIaVGylR69wuxXA;LxPE1kW-kkYr_PcpZKl9jQ;Nice hotel with big comfortable rooms.  Parking is really expensive (~$44 per day to self-park w/o in-and-out priv., ~$53 to valet w/in-and-out priv.), but not out of the ordinary for the area.  The hotel begins on the 5th floor of the building, where the Sky Lobby is located.  Rooms go up onto the higher floors from there.  So, from the street, you should expect 2 elevator rides and a walk across the Sky Lobby no matter where your room is.  The location is very good, near the river, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Lake Shore Drive, Tribune Tower, NBC Tower, and the Chicago Loop.  They are well within walking distance to most of those places and plenty to do (plus, plenty of places to eat).  I did not take advantage of the bar, the manager's reception, or the breakfast.  However, the breakfast did look pretty busy, so keep that in mind as you read other reviews mentioning it. My only real complaint about the hotel is their keys.  If you insert and remove the key too fast or too slow, it won't work.  It's hard to gauge exactly how to do it right, consistently.  I heard others complain about this, too, on the elevator.  After a long day, when you're really tired, the last thing you want to have to do is fight with your room key.   Other than that, highly recommended.;4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
246;3/3/2012;iNKgbaQ233W2FDQZ4nMu;RBZ_kMjowV0t6_nv2UKaDQ;Four solid stars because of the price, customer service, the fact that every room is a suite, they provide free breakfast in the morning, they have free cocktail and snack hour at night and the hotel is in the heart of Chicago.;4;4;3;3;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

248;9/8/2011;MIgS7wGl6UiHzK6HiqpRzA;Kh9LtB3AI6RerZ_uSCi7Zw;Really loved my stay here especially after my stay at the Sheraton across the street.  The rooms are newly renovated so they are fairly new and set up like an apartment with a living/dining room and separate bedroom.  There is also a microwave, sink, and fridge which has lots of room for you to buy snacks or drinks, etc. and not full of overpriced liquors you don't want to buy.  There is also a Dominick's/Safeway right across the street so there is no reason not to stock your fridge.  There are tv's in both rooms so I'd be great for a small family to have some room to spread out. The atrium in the middle of the hotel brings in a lot of light and the glass railings are both cool and scary!  The extras that they throw in are what made me love my 3-day stay.  Free breakfast buffet, free happy hour from 5-7, a free US weekly newspaper at your door in the morning, and really nice Crabtree and Evelyn shampoos and soaps (this seems basic, but lots of hotels don't give you free shampoos anymore). Oh and they have an internet room that has free printing so you can check-in to your flights or check email.  All of this for less than what I paid for a single room at the Sheraton which was decent, but nothing special.  (No free anything at Sheraton!  Not even good soap!)   I have to admit I didn't have the breakfast here as I was too busy, but the fact that it is offered is a total plus in my book!  Yes there were lots of people in line during breakfast, but I asked a couple how the food was and they said the make your own omelets and fresh fruits were good.   The bell hops and valets downstairs are also curteous and friendly.  They will help you with your bags or get you a cab in a second.   One tip -- get your hotel on http://priceline.com for the best deal ever!;5;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
249;2/8/2011;is-wPDckgfJefB047w80oQ;njaX48crMW0RPONr54PdSQ;I couldn't believe the price when I booked a suite here for me and five others. The rooms are not the most spacious, but for the price, it's great. And the location was perfect. They were located a few blocks from everywhere we wanted to go. To your left is the Art Institute of Chicago, Aquarium, Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain, and more. To your right was the Magnificent Mile shopping area, tons of restaurants, Chicago Water Tower, and John Hancock Observatory. Although we weren't directly located next to anything, it worked out perfect to me in close to everything rather than closer to some places than other. Another perk was that we located right across from Dominic's Pharmacy. We walked there regularly for snacks. Saving the best for last, the absolute BEST thing about this hotel is: - Complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. (Time varies by the day) - Made to order omelets of your choice. - Complimentary happy hour w/ chips & salsa and other snacks. - The nicest bellperson(s). Greeted everyday entering and leaving. And were very helpful with any questions we had. Other perks that I didn't take advantage of: - Indoor pool. - Gym. - Lounging area in lobby. I highly recommend this hotel! My friends and I were very pleased with our experience.;4;5;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
250;9/28/2011;aehTlu;zfWG-mS2c9R1ES5adp_eiQ;Embassy suites has some nice rooms with decent beds.  With the suites you get the seperate room which isnt much use in Chicago since you shouldnt be spending much time in the room anyway.  There is free breakfast here and a managers drink hour which isnt worth much either.  The breakfast is below average and you have to wait in a line across the lobby to get a free drink.   The location of this hotel is great with plenty of great restaurants near by and very close to Michigan ave, and the Navy Pier.   Dont plan on parking your car here since it is about $50/night try to find parking near by.   If you stay here skip the free breakfast and head over to Yokes which is awesome, also go to Joes steak seafood and crab for a great dinner;4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
251;2/22/2011;2Kspuccz9Kd8;hsfuLzgtLo7AasgZBDcHuQ;Positives: close to many attractions, free breakfast and managers reception, very nice staff Negatives: $41/day parking, needs a little TLC Stayed for the long weekend with family. If we had to get somewhere and feed breakfast for the nine of us, would have been time consuming and expensive. You could have cooked to order omelets or buffet style scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, biscuits and gravy. Also had a managers reception with free drinks and snacks. Was nice to unwind after being out in the city all day. Some minor issues with soap rack in shower loose, toilet seat loose etc. I know that it is expensive to park in the city but at least cut something off for staying at the hotel vs. just parking there. Easy walk to shopping, site seeing or dining.;4;2;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
252;1/2/2011;eGPwkni;xxxEqdPt2bapEapu1yGGTw;Stayed at this hotel at the end of the year to check out the fireworks at the Navy Pier. The hotel valet enterance is easily missed (on a one way street), but made it in the 2nd loop. Also the valet area is very crowded with people checking in and out, as well as cabbies. We waited for a few minutes before we could pull in. (Our car blocked the drive during check out, but we were prepared to load up and go. So only about a 3 minute hold up...) Upon checking in, the car was moved safely into a heated garage space by the valet (yes we snuck out and checked later). The hotel registration is up the elevators to the right. After we cheked in, we went up to our floor, and was welcomed by a grand view (see posted picures to see what I am talking about.) Already mentioned in a lot of other reviews, but... 1) Cooked-To-Order Breakfast (6:30am - 9:00am) is basically a tailored omlette your choices of spinach, chedder cheese, ham, bacon, jalapenos, peppers, onions, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. I just went for everything! 2) Managers reception (from 5:30 till 7:30pm) is basically free drinks and appetizers (chips and fries). A nice perk. 3) The room has a bedroom with either two full or one king (we stayed at the one king room suite) and a door that separates into the living room with a pull out sofa bed. (I heard that it was on the stiff side, but hey I didn't have to sleep in it.) 4) Pool, gym and sauna (6:00am till midnight) are available for people who want to work out. I went for couple laps at the pool, and used the sauna. Very refreshing in the morning. 5) Walking distance to main shopping area of town (i.e. Michigan Ave.). 6) Navy pier is two blocks from this place. A great place for a family visit Definitely a great family hotel, and if the rates meet my budget, definitely will stay again.;4;2;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

In the PM, the bar staff that run the manger's special take the time to get to know you and always remember your order (remember to tip them well) even if the snacks are kind of costcoesque.

256;6/9/2012;6;GUAmLeYDDCXQcK3wyVYUvw;Just returned from a family vacation in Chicago. I have two active teenagers and this hotel served us extremely well.  Great location for a vacation, centrally located to most downtown activities.  The staff was helpfull and responsive to our needs.  Every employee seemed to enjoy thier job.  Breakfast was decent in quality and great in quantity.  Rooms were big and clean, great for a family.  The fold-out couch was just ok for a teenager but would have been very uncomfortable for an adult. The tv's were difficult to operate. Lots of families and lots youth soccer teams enjoyed the hotel so the noise level was high.  Not a place for a quite getaway but fit my needs of a family vacation.;4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
257;8/9/2009;zHBsWgin66P22S6A86OHVQ;Bgfu2QuVV62Hnhw2iZsDEQ;I usually don't review hotels in YELP (at least not yet) but I figured I would  for this one since I stay here so often. Embassy Suites Lakefront is my 'go-to' hotel when I stay in Chicago. It's in a great location if you need to be downtown. It's short walk to either Navy Pier or Michigan Ave, or just a short cab ride away to most other places in Chi-town. The hotel staff is very friendly across the board. The rooms are all pretty good and the hotel is clean. If you're a Hilton Honors member, be sure to ask if they have any corner rooms available, for they usually have larger living rooms than the traditional rooms. Their morning breakfast buffet is quite good with a lot of variety. Probably one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts available (trust me, they're not all created equal). The made to order omelets are worth the (short) wait. The evening Happy Hour is also a nice plus and a great place to unwind or congregate before heading out to dinner. If heading to Chicago for a few days, be sure to consider this as an option for your stay.;4;2;0;1;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

They made it seem like this was some fancy suite and it wasn't much different than the regular rooms and they made a huge deal about getting us into it.  Which I still don't understand.;4;2;1;1;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

The location is also pretty good.. two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Michigan Avenue.  And it's much bigger than the other Embassy Suites in downtown. The biggest thing I didn't like was the check out time was 11 am.  Way too early in my opinion.  Also, the check in time was 4 pm.. a little too late.  But they have a great concierge service to leave your luggage with them.;5;0;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
260;4/25/2007;eLocyu86Ej-C8ati2vofcA;VveQW3yKqgi8gAjwKzUVBg;As a loyal Hilton traveller, I would rate this the better of the two Embassy Suites in Chicago. Still, I guess I have a thing with them because I feel like there's a cost you pay for having a suite and having free breakfast. The workout room is slightly above average, the breakfast is pretty good and the staff is quite friendly. Big negative in getting a smoking room, though I didn't mind that much since it didn't smell. Also, negatives for not recognizing my status (yeah, I have it so I'm officially that guy) and for making me pay for the internet. The manager's special is a nice touch, though you only get well drinks and draft beers. The food is slightly edible. I guess I'd come back here, but still want to try other hotels in town first.;3;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

262;1/20/2012;h4WjufqAKfKimKbbCZPAKw;9AJRxuFrKuD1HwXdoivq5A;Good location, right near Navy Pier. Great view from our room facing the lake. However there was NOTHING fancy about the room, it was the exact one you get at a Country Inn & Suites suite for a lot less. It was weird to have to take an elevator to the lobby, then another to the room. There were kids everywhere. Too many kids, you would think there was a water park in it or something. I'm a Mom myself but this was a kid-free (our own at least) girls trip with 4 of my friends (we all fit in the room fine btw) and I wasn't in the mood to deal with apparently orphaned kids running amok, with parents nowhere in sight. A group of 4 or 5 kids decided to sit on the floor in the hallway  in front of their room 2 doors down from us and hang out. At 10:30 p.m. We went to use the Jacuzzi, it it was full of..you guessed it, kids. More like teenagers but still kids! Also at 10:30 p.m. I called the front desk, who said they would call security and make them leave since kids weren't supposed to be in there. Went back down and there they were. UGH! We never did get to use it, or the narrow tiny pool (also brat filled) Waited FOREVER to get a drink at the manager's reception (didn't mind though since we brought our own drinks from the room, and by the time we got to the front they had been drank.) The drinks were gross, my friends' apple martini was disgusting! And I have never been known to turn one down. I slept through breakfast but my friends said it was good. Nice building and location, but I wouldn't go back.;2;1;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

264;7/29/2010;8vAjtdHcPvQpAE-AP5N3NQ;NaFddVXLIezB0PK_ZDSjmA;This hotel has a good location close to the lakefront, Navy Pier, and Michigan Avenue:all are less than a 10 minute walk. away. There is a large supermarket right across the street, so for an extended stay you can get drinks or snacks to keep in your room. Extensive and high quality breakfast buffet included in the room price. Internet access is costly ($15/day):it should be included. The only complaints I can muster are (1) accessing the street requires using two elevators and a short walk:the guest elevators reach a "sky lobby" at 4th floor level and then you then have to go to another elevator to get to the street and (2) it's not near public transit:taxi fare from Midway is about $30 and from O'Hare about $45, or you could take the trains to Union Station and then a taxi for about $10.;4;3;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
265;4/20/2011;Pf4svCvzvTsMGEC41nmpbw;IR_1kgGZgnRlvkr_QH8RwA;Stayed here for five nights - didn't have a car (thank goodness). I think it was the time frame we were there but the hotel seemed to have a lot of families.  Nothing wrong with that, just take it as a comment.  I'm more used to staying in hotels that were more business people or couples.  When you add in a bunch of children it changes the dynamics a bit. Breakfast -- Crowded but seemed to work itself out.  You either went early or went last minute.  If you wanted the "made to order" then you would need to be there early (tips are accepted).  The cook was amazing.  Also amazing were the people who cleaned up after the hordes.  These folks kept tables cleaned and new people got tables. The food was broken into three areas.  Made to order, hot dishes (eggs, bacon, pancakes) and then continental breakfast. Kudos to Oscar -- always had a smile and kept tables moving... Rooms - Ours had a comfy bed and the rest of the furniture was a hodge-podge.  The televisions had a limited number of channels and the only pay per view worth watching was "The Kings Speech", but why spend time in the room.  There was a fridge and a small microwave.  You will have to borrow some plates/silverware for your food. Dominicks is across the street so you can get food from there if you really need it. Evening food/drinks -- yep, it's there.  Nothing to go nuts over (no pun intended).  Small drinks (beer, wine) and some mixed drinks.  You save a little with not going to a bar but it depends what you like.  Munchies were of the nuts, salsa/chips variety. Noise -- even with the noise of the families your room isn't that bad.  Yes you can hear them next door but if they aren't the party type then all is good.  Put the TV up a little. Elevators -- very fast Internet - go across the street to Dominicks or down the street to Panera Bread and use theirs.  Also there is a business center on the ballroom floor that you can hook at cat5 cable into and not use the wireless but it is a small room. Workers there were very very nice -- even with the rude tourists.  I never saw them lose control.  Even the mother who dumped orange juice all over the place and proceeded to yell at everyone.  They cleaned it up and kept things moving.  I like the people there. Would I go back, sure, if the price was good.;4;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
266;1/22/2007;H9INucEUR8EV2CBZMxjMcA;kuj-vqEOHOwUjswReZFjMQ;By far, one of the best deals on a nice hotel in Chicago.  My mom stays here when she comes to visit, and after seeing some of the other hotels she has stayed ta in the city this is by far my favorite.  The rooms are two room suites, which give you tons of space.  Free breakfast with made to order omlettes, yum- I tried them and they get 5 stars for sure!  Free open bar from 5 to 7 I think.  This hotel is blocks away from Navy Pier and blocks away from Michigan Ave.  I think the average price for a night is about $115, which is super cheap for downtown.  Very clean and all of the staff seemed very pleasant.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice hotel on a budget right downtown.;5;1;1;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

268;8/13/2009;0qGYLwMX5yDcLHqQFIqR6A;dk5yqirSwDH7Cpp52NdhUA;Have stayed at many an Embassy Suites in my time from coast to coast, this one was disappointing.  Now mind you, did get to stay free due to Hilton points, but meh is meh and would've been pissed off if I were paying!   The hotel is based on the older models of Embassy Suites, ie. the prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium look.   On the positive side: Two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Miracle Mile.  Walking distance to a few other things too. Grocery store across the street was cool for getting stuff to put in room and a Walgreens a block away. On the negative side: It was crawling with little kiddies of which one we heard crying at night through our room walls (very thin walls I think), the room had no safe or makeup mirror, it had a sink in the bedroom which I thought was rather odd, it took a hella long time for them to bring our bags up after we checked in, they say it takes 20mins to get your car out of valet and for you to call well in advance, OMG you could hear the drunks at the atrium bar at night even with our tv on (the sound just echoed up 10 floors), front desk only had 1-2 people working it at any given time and the concierge was not very helpful or friendly when she was there - which wasn't often, this was the first ES we've been to where they had signs up in the elevators telling you what times breakfast would be more crowded than others, and let me tell you about that!!! Made to order breakfast often had a long line unless you hit it just right and all I saw people get were omelette's and bacon, sausage, and potatoes.  Breakfast was THE SAME everyday!  Two buffet lines with eggs that looked and tasted like powdered eggs, bacon and sausage links, pancakes, and yogurt.  Also watery oatmeal, 3 dried cereals, lots of donuts, and toast and English muffins.  One buffet line had food that was always not warm and you only got orange or apple juice as your choices.  The managers reception in evening was alright. Cell phone reception was zip in our room and valet parking with in and out privileges was 49$ but self park without in and out was 42$.;2;0;0;1;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
269;5/11/2008;4ZDWj8i0xRb-eL0H5nDYkQ;4ix2HfNHHFKRIew1WBe2nQ;We had our wedding here and it was perfect. For a downtown location, it is very reasonable. We worked with Thelma and she was so wonderful. The room is a little narrow and long, but that is my only issue. The staff was so nice and they dealt with many of our annoying family members with tons of grace. They did have a light malfunction that no one could fix, but our dj set up a make shift lighting arrangement with his equipment. It actually looked pretty cool!

270;5/15/2008;NEe6SuLi4YBHvNwzyjcBaA;qsvsTD9cIPbr9pAyNZMO3w;For the amount of money we paid, this was a great hotel.  The hotel is located only a couple of blocks from Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile.  Our suite had a queen size bed in the bedroom, as well as a convertable sofa in the living room.  The living room also had a flat-screen tv.  While all of these amenities were nice, in my opininon, the hotel's best feature is the complimentary manager's reception from 5:30 to 7:30 each night.  For two hours, they offer their guests free well drinks and free domestic draft beer, as well as free chips and salsa to snack on.  Needless to say, we took full advantage of the hotel's generosity during our three night stay.  Depending on what night of the week you are there, there may be a bit of a line for the drinks.  This was the case on a Saturday evening.  We quickly learned that the best way to deal with this was to get our drinks and then get back in line.  By the time we finished our drinks, we were at the front of the line and could order more.  The hotel also offers a complimentary breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 on weekdays and from 7:00 to 10:30 on weekends.  We never woke up in time to make it to breakfast, but apparently they offer made to order omelettes.  Ironically, I think our taking advantage of the complimentary evening reception may have in part contributed to our inability to make it to the complimentary breakfast.;5;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg
271;8/1/2011;5WZJctyWnxp5zr0E11x02Q;BNCrIBHL-F9wh96vBs_i6A;This is a wonderful hotel with a friendly staff and outstanding service.  Tracee at the front desk was wonderful.  The rooms are large, beds are comfortable with a duvet cover, fluffy towels, reasonably sized kitchen area.  Breakfast is excellent, although sometimes difficult to get a table.  Pool is good - spa a little hot for most, but stil ok. The only negative... it is located near a fire station, as is other hotels in the area.  So get a high floor if necessary, as was our 11th floor.  It was not that bad.  Valet service is competitive and excellent, but takes about 10 minutes. Overall - this is a terrific value, great services, friendly staff..  Take if from someone who travels frequently.  This hotel was nicer than the Chicago Hilton, without the fancy ceiling.   The Hilton does have one of the cows.   that's what you're paying for.;5;3;0;1;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

274;1/6/2009;-;4u4jJoK_dy5P00f-jQZvRg;Huh? Did all of these people stay at the same hotel I did? I stayed here for 2 miserable nights and  will not be back. The ONLY reason to stay here is that it is close to the redline. I booked a room for some last minute travel right before New Years. Since my stay in Chicago was going to be over the holiday, I wanted to be close to the redline so I could visit friends. This hotel fulfills this need well. The room was clean, but horribly dated. The counter/minibar area was beat to hell. Huge gouges in it, I have no idea what happened. The bathroom was much the same way. The cabinet doors under the sink were hanging off their hinges. Not what I expected staying on the Hilton Honors floor. Putting an LCD tv in an otherwise 30 year old room does not update it. This is all cosmetic, so I didn't care much. And for those of you reading this thinking I simply put down Hamptons, read my other reviews, I tend to stay at Hampton Inns more than any other hotel. This is by far the worst I have ever been to. There was 1 open outlet in the proximity of the bed/desk area. Huh? some of us have to charge our phone and laptop at the same time. Imagine that The ABSOLUTE worst, is the fact it is across the street from one of the busiest firehouses in the city. Nothing better than listening to wailing fire engines all night. I honestly think the guy that was passed out in the elevator when I got back on New Years slept better than I did in my bed. If you are looking for a hotel in the area, look elsewhere, or bring earplugs.;2;2;1;2;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw
275;8/28/2011;ZM6gnJCtI0zlC03gDPppoA;xqzpyRWN2pvhEbxg1rI0Ng;I stepped in and felt like I had stepped into the 70s. And the floor was so dirty. We took our shoes off, and after about an hour, the bottoms of our feet were all black. So gross. Most importantly, several of my girlfriends came over. We're all professionals in our late 20s-early 30s. We were laughing and giggling but definitely were not screaming or being loud. An extremely rude manager came up and told us that we were being too loud, he could hear us downstairs, and that there had been 2 complaints. If there was a 3rd complaint, we would have to leave the hotel, which we should have done anyway. First of all, 2 of our friends were resting in the bedroom because they had headaches and barely heard us. We were on the 5th floor. So if they could hear us in the lobby, the construction must be outrageously poor. 5 minutes later, they sent a cop up, who was actually very pleasant. But really, a cop? By then, we were just sitting around, trying to figure out where to go. Not being loud at all. Go spend your money somewhere else. There are plenty of better and cleaner hotels...with more pleasant managers. The only pleasant people we encountered at the hotel were the valets. They were the only ones to get a nice tip.;1;1;0;1;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw
276;7/20/2011;X9QWovmlJvqZoxSqarbdGA;vgZH1EIDzr__8TTdY5-UzA;The least pleasant aspect of the hotel was trying to relax in the whirlpool tub while there were young children in it. The rules sign says children under 14 are not permitted but both times we tried to visit it there were children. The first time a mom brought 4 young children in who were splashing around and knocking into me and my boyfriend. I mentioned to her that children weren't allowed but she didn't do anything. I told the front desk as we were leaving that day. The next time I noticed it before we got in, so I called from a hotel phone to the front desk to let them know. They said they would take care of it, but I did not see a hotel representative during the next hour or so we were there, and again, children were in the whirlpool. I feel that the staff of the hotel should regularly monitor and enforce this rule, since the parents seem unwilling to follow it on their own. We tend to really enjoy the pool/hottub at hotels we visit, so I'm not sure I'd come here again... The free breakfast was a little similar but reasonably good each day, especially the make-your-own fresh waffles. Wifi worked well, staff was friendly and responsive (except for the whirlpool issue). When it was raining they let us borrow a couple of umbrellas. Only a block from the Grand stop on the red line.;2;1;0;0;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

I stayed here almost an year back for 20 days. -Location: Hampton is located in the heart of downtown. It's just a block away from red line station. It's very near to all the good restaurants and Chicago River Walk.Clubs like Excalibur, Andy's live jazz and restuarants like Shaw Crab house,Braazars,Benny's Steak House are very close. -Room: My room was quite big with all the facilities like a small fridge, microwave,coffee machine,ironing board, iron and flat screen.Bed was very big and comfortable.It had a couch and small table.The room had a very good Wi-Fi connection.Closet with security safe. The bathroom had all the basic amenities and was very clean. -Staff: Staff is very helpful right from the doorman, receptionist and manager. They go all the way to help you out whether it's getting a cab or getting tickets for the local cubs game. -Hotel: It had a business centre which has Internet,printer and fax facility. The pool and jacuzzi area is clean enough to be used.Gym is very basic,they should add some more equimenmts. -Food: The complimentary breakfast was very good.It consisted of waffles,coffee,cakes,eggs,juice machine,fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits,sausage and different variety of cereals. The bad part is if you are staying too long in the Hotel like I did, one does get bored with the same breakfast daily. I did request them to change their menu.Will have to stay again at Hampton to check if they changed it or not. -Drawbacks: It's very near to fire station so there is a constant disturbance due to fire alarm voice. Even when the windows are closed the sound is quite prominent inside the room.;4;0;0;0;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

I'm disappointed, the response from management was to be expected - they will not be responsible. I drove away this morning since I left at 6.30am, and just looked at it when I arrived home in Michigan. I absolutely know that my vehicle was only parked in the garage at the Hampton Inn during my stay. The rest of my visit, someone was in the truck at all times. Right before I left home to visit Chicago, I worked with the hitch for the trailer I am about to purchase to ensure I saw how everything should be connected. At that time, (two days earlier) there were no scratches, no cracks and the bumper was flush with the hitch cover. I paid $42 per day for parking and the care of my vehicle was crap. Do not park at this hotel. Additionally, my room was noisy (I heard every conversation down the hall at all times) although the hotel staff was mostly pleasant. Altogether this was an extremely disappointing visit.  Park across the street if you stay here.  I lived in Chi Town for 2 years so I'm used to the fire engines/ambulances everywhere but cannot stomach the horrible care of my vehicle.;1;0;0;0;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

The rooms while awesome (caveat---I was in a suite), do have some of the original features of the Ambassador so the bathrooms are a tad small and there are a few other quirky nuisances.  But a small price to pay for a bad ass experience.;5;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

Great service.  Guest services responded promptly to all requests. 2. Free Wifi.  I wish every hotel had this. 3. Drinks in the bar were good and we had some small plates which weren't bad. Cons: 1. Place needs like two more elevators.  At least. 2. Walls are paper thin. 3. Everything in the room is a bit "off".  One of the lights in the bathroom (not a lot of light to begin with) went out.  Twice.  The bathroom door kept sticking.  They gutted this building and they couldn't replace the bathroom door knobs/hinges? 4. Also (and this may sound strange), but they include a body lotion tube but not a shower gel?  I feel like shower gels are the norm these days so I was surprised to see a bar of soap in the shower. 5. Did I mention they need more elevators? Just an FYI, as noted in the other reviews, the whole lobby basically turns into a club at night on Friday/Saturday.;3;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

The all white gives a very clean appearance and looks fantastic with the black accents. If it weren't for that, I'd give the hotel 3 stars. Our hotel room mirrored that, but was a lot more basic (and I mean-A LOT). The bed was comfortable and we had no problems with the TV or air. Our bathtub would not drain which was no good but other than that, very satisfied with our stay.;3;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
286;8/20/2012;5uZtBV8w3tJhMZzfBA6WuQ;vHL-gl5zgZbMcVJzbshDzg;Honestly, public has always been my favorite hotel in Chicago area, I stayed at this place couple times. But this time, I have to give them 1 star, and if I could, I would give them a 0. And I will never stay there again. Here is my story: Me and my boyfriend stayed at public on Tuesday and we checked out on Wednesday and went back to Indiana. When I was home, I found I left my jacket in the room. And we called the hotel, they said nothing was found in my room. But my boyfriend and I both clearly remember we left the jacket on the hanger in the closet! We are pretty sure about this. I was so sad because this is a rare find Chanel jacket which I just purchased in Miami two weeks again and hasn't worn once! And it still has price tag in it, which says 5000 dollars! I don't want to assume the housekeeping people stolen my jacket, but there's no other way I can think of it! And we drove four hours to Chicago that night just want to make sure if we can find back my coat, but the front desk people said they never found it. I guess I just lost it forever. I was so disappointed about that, and this is the worst hotel experience in my whole life. I don't think a decent hotel should expect this kind of things happen. So if you want to stay at this place. Make sure you take care of your belongings. Otherwise, it is gonna disappear forever!;1;2;0;4;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

It modern, tasteful, and looks like something you'd see in the most upscale NY Hotel. - The beds are super comfortable. - The water pressure in the shower is excellent. (Nothing is worse than discovering a hotel with low flow shower heads!) - The happy hour and night life is great. (And this was on a Tue and Wed - The weekends are probably even better.) - You can walk to lots of great restaurants and shopping. - They have bikes that you can borrow - FOR FREE! - Wifi is free and easy to access. The Cons: - None, Zero, Zilch I will definitely be coming back to this hotel.;5;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
288;7/5/2012;j;zAddDr8fzyTV-YB2wSoWTA;There was this big event during the weekend of my stay so the place was packed. The staff was friendly and nice. The restaurant downstairs had great food and divine desserts, and very good coffee.  There was a bar that was quite full the whole period of my stay and a decent selection of wine. I love the room decor and I had a nice view out my window as well. The bathroom was teeny tiny but it was adequate for one person. The room itself was spacious enough and uncluttered, just the way I like it. I think the location is wonderful, the general area was pretty safe. I'd say that the main negative for me was the noise level from outside the room during the day (while cleaning? not sure) but it was fairly quiet at night.;4;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
289;5/8/2012;6YGGPHveThqOWhEIDQJWYg;8M6suLprYcMngrJjhYl_lw;The Public is by all accounts an Ian Schrager hotel.  Which is lovely....if you enjoy your bed on the floor and your  bathroom miniscule.  I don't.  So I'm not the perfect Schrager-stayer so to speak. The bed feels like a futon, but the sheets were nice and soft.  Decent TV and an ipod dock.  NO ALARM CLOCK.  Which is annoying.  I want an alarm clock in my room please.  Desk was not very user friendly and definitely not comfortable.  Bathroom was teenie tiny and I ran out of hot water the first day at 7:30am.  Apparently they had water heater issues that day, but they failed to let us know. On the plus side the little coffee bar is fabulous.  Very good lattes.  And the bar is cool and hip and has decent wine.   Overall, I like a little more comfort when I stay away from home.  So I can't say that I loved the Public.;2;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
290;7/2/2012;dU4r8OaNriRHyfJq5YAMww;ff4VHRfE3UpG8BTZb9jZKA;Public is a stunning hotel in the best neighborhood in Chicago. The decor is to die for. The hotel was previously The Ambassador hotel and it's face lift to Public was well worth the effort. I stayed over the weekend and received excellent customer service. There are many spaces in the hotel to sit and relax with food, cocktails or coffee, each space more fabulous than the last. On the weekends the place was packed with people going to the restaurant and bars, definitely a see and be seen kind of place. I can't wait to come back and stay again.;5;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
291;8/28/2012;NBGRvOgJ1OfxdSbD7Wfz7g;bZpyCsCN1okekqY5NcBblA;We stayed in one of the suites for my friends' weddings so that they could have someplace for people to hang out if there wasn't room elsewhere.  The room was nice enough.  The staff was awkward and aloof, maybe a little bit rude, but maybe they were just having a bad moment....The air conditioning was really loud.  There were cords all over the place because the hotel is old and rather than *actually* renovate the hotel, they painted it white.  I rarely interacted with any hotel staff.... Except for the valet attendants... and that is where things got really bad for us.  We parked our car there both at an hourly rate and overnight over the two days that we stayed there (the first night I drove home to the suburbs to be with our baby)s....  I paid for the valet, tipped the attendants who had parked my car waaaay off to the side (of course!) and got home after our stay to find that my brand new car was damaged noticeably in two places--the fender and the bumper.  Mind you, this isn't the 'I didn't notice' kind of damage.  Rather, someone tapped (rather hard) against a wall or another car, and another car skinned my car's rear bumper.  And so begins my conversion from lukewarm guest to horribly dissatisfied guest.   The hotel gave me the number of the valet company and told me not to call that day because the owner, with whom I would need to speak, would be out of the office.  I called the next morning and spoke with Kathy from GP parking who said she would call me back.  Three days later, still no return call, I call Kathy, ask to speak to Tom, the owner, she says that she is actually the person I should talk to and 'why did I wait so long to say anything--and why didn't I say something when I picked the car up from the attendants--and not to say that you would, but you could have had an incident on the way home that caused this damage but you want to blame it on us so that we pay for it.....'  She continued like that, accusing me of lying and being overall incredibly rude, disinterested and insulting about the whole thing.   So I called the hotel.  The ladies at the hotel (first Emelia, then MaryBeth) were nice as pie to me and supposedly did get in touch with their valet company.  By their accounts the valet company conducted a thorough (impartial????) investigation and will not take any responsibility for my vehicle's damage.   I am, absolutely, without a doubt, 100% certain that they did, in fact, damage my car.  And I PAID THEM TO DO IT!  I EVEN TIPPED THEM!!!!!   My friends' Most Expensive Wedding I Ever Paid For As An Attendee/Maid of Honor continues to suck my wallet dry.  The damage most certainly exceeds the cost of my hotel room (and I mentioned we stayed in a suite, right?).  Of course, Public Chicago is not responsible because the hotel hired the horribly rude folk from GP parking to do their valet for them, but they do charge for the valet directly through the hotel.  They didn't even, as a simple gesture, offer to refund the valet fee.  Or any portion of my hotel stay.  Or agree to fire their valet service, which frankly would have been a slightly satisfactory response.....  If they had just told me then and there that they had damaged my car, I would have been okay with it--and I really would have appreciated their honesty.  But they didn't have the decency to do so, and now I hemorrhage more money.  And, did I mention, I absolutely DETEST the institution they call the Public Hotel Chicago????  I do.  I am horribly dissappointed and insulted by the way I was treated.;1;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
292;2/26/2012;BZNqgeDceYtzMJIPGy6EzQ;idtf-MaJZo6F5jL3NcBB_w;I love staying in new "concept" hotels so when Public opened last year, I wanted to check it out. We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it but it didn't make as big as an impression on us like the Conrad and Palomar did. This is the former Ambassador hotel and Public plays with a lot of the Ambassador style.  This was not a total renovation. Public simply added a few modern touches. Rooms are minimal in style but effective and comfortable. Our room had a very narrow entryway in which a room service tray could barely fit through.  Doors on the closet and bathroom are the originals left over from the Ambassador so they are old and don't close very well.  I love the placement of quirky photos around the room. My biggest complaint with the rooms would have to be the fairly thin walls. If the person in the next room talks slightly above a normal speaking voice be prepared to hear everything. Bathroom was small but had nice clean lines. The bathtub walls were really high for some reason. We ordered their room service, Public Express, for dinner and breakfast. While the dinner was exceptional, breakfast was just okay. Better than Burger King but I've had better at other hotels. The rest of the hotel looks great and the lobby and restaurant are packed on the weekends. Fitness center is very well equipped. But as other people have noted on here, the hallways and especially the elevators are too dark. You can't see which button to push to get to your floor.  Location is nice since it's close to Michigan Avenue but not directly on the busy street.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. So why don't I love it? Like I said, Hotel Palomar and the Conrad "wow" me with their style and service. I think Public is going more for an "understated" vibe which is good. I guess I like my automatic upgrades for being a Hilton Diamond member @ Conrad. Or I look forward to my wine hour and zebra print robes @ Palomar. It's a hotel. I kind of prefer "fancy" not "understated".;4;1;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
293;2/16/2012;4p3w0JvV-ENyNDv44dMU5g;WnK-YoiG_naksEQ8v00kiQ;The Schrager crowd all grown up!  happy to see a more cosmopolitan crowd and less dancing twenty-somethings in the lobby and  hallways upstairs.   Room service from The Pump Room by Jean-Georges is the best room service one can hope for from a hotel. All in all it was a pleasant experience, I enjoyed the residential location as well as the decor and the fact that there is a Jean-Georges outpost on site. Somewhere the tag line "At PUBLIC, service matters most." doesn't quite translate successfully.  The staff, although attentive, is not quite there in terms of anticipating a guest's needs.  A birthday cake was delivered without silverware or plates to eat it with.  A quick call to the front desk solved the problem in less than 10 minutes.   I requested said cake too late in the afternoon the day before my arrival so the hotel was not able to accommodate my request.  The concierge was at a loss as well.  I had to suggest to her to see if there were any bakeries near by which could come thru.  I was able to arrange for the cake from 35,000 feet in the air.  I would think that a good concierge would have been able to manage it from less than  1/2 mile away. If the hotel were not to bill itself as a new breed focused on service then I would have given them all 5 stars.  But when they are so focused on selling themselves as a service institution and then come short, I simply cannot be an 100% fan.;3;0;0;1;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
294;8/12/2012;-XJvPOlCj9CEmWLcdvqq8A;f5xVG1q9iRvecgjc0vn70Q;I really wanted to like this hotel-great location, cool-hip vibe (love Ian Schrager), earnest staff (meaning they TRY), and great rates.  However, number of problems.  First, it's VERY loud-as in very little soundproofing.  Second, you can't order a meal at the bar.  Well, technically you can, but it's a ridiculously limited menu.  When I'm traveling on business by myself, I do NOT want to sit in the dining room and I like the convenience of eating at the hotel if I'm particularly busy.  And it's too bad-I would have easily eaten there every night of my four night stay (as I have been known to do at times) if the food was good, but I never got a chance to try it.  Third, they charge you 18% service for oatmeal to go in their cafe (really???).  Fourth, room service comes in "to-go".  That's fine, but don't charge me 18% service for that-at least put it on china.  Or just tell me to go downstairs and pick it up.  Oh yeah, they charge you 18% there too.  I agree with some of the other comments, the staff here is really nice.  But some of the management policies are silly.  And not sure I could overcome the noise issue.  Probably will not stay here again.;3;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
295;7/9/2012;shjGEHlJFcNmfxbOq3hqIA;76aSbT8EEVdon2DMLbEMcQ;Public was recommended to me by a couple of friends who recently moved from Chicago.  I was intrigued by the idea of a new Ian Schrager hotel.  They made a great suggestion. Travel Date:  July 2-8, 2012 We were greeted at our car by an eager bellboy.  He quickly packed the luggage cart with the aid of our Echo Limousine driver (recommended).  The common spaces are lovely and well appointed.  At check-in my partner and I were promptly assisted.  The desk clerk noticed I had booked a smokin' hot special online for a regular queen room.  When she saw the height of my partner, 6'3", she said, "let's see if we can find something a little bigger."  She upgraded our room, at no additional cost, to a corner King Deluxe.  We had three large windows, a full walk-in closet and plenty of room for our week long stay.   The building is two blocks from the Lake and in a beautiful Near North neighborhood.  Just a few blocks south is the Rush St and Division St scene.  Good nightlife, restaurants, music and cocktails.  A taxi was always waiting and if you prefer public transportation the Red Line has a station at State/Division.  If you like car service, UBER has fantastic coverage in the downtown area and is never more than a couple of minutes from Public. Pump Room provided a fantastic Fourth of July Dinner for 11 guests at a moment's notice.  They even comped a selection of flatbreads.   Our stay was not without hiccups...  We experienced Chicago's hottest July Fourth in over 100 years.  This caused the satellite receivers to overheat and we lost TV reception for two partial days and one full day.  Upon inquiring about the loss of signal, several options were provided, free movie tickets, free bike rentals or assistance booking other entertainment, spa services & tours.  Our shower head had a leak that sprayed water backwards directly on the wall and ceiling.  It didn't bother me but I figured I'd let them know to avoid future damage to the walls.  They sent a repairman after we left the room for the day and when we returned we had a voice-mail from guest services notifying us of the repair and apologizing for the (nonexistent) inconvenience.   Everyone we encountered was fantastic:great service in Pump Room, fantastic mixologists in both bars, quick room service and helpful guest relations.   The only thing missing is a day spa, of course I knew this when I booked the room.  They partner with a place just down the street but I feel that a Hotel of this caliber should have an in-house facility. I will gladly stay here again.;5;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
296;12/30/2011;gUJEnYjSjBeYJe0qiJBEXw;JwFL596bNA-9Bf0jU_Oxmg;This Ian Schrager retooling of an iconic Chicago hotel seamlessly melds classic architectural details with modern style and service. The hotel hasn't been open for long, and the quality of service is where this fact is most obvious. The staff are all improbably attractive, and tremendously green. I'm sure that they'll get better, but the generally inexperienced staff -- front desk, valets, coffee bar, bar -- are what cost this hotel a star in my review. Probably would have cost them two stars had they not all been so good-looking! I'd definitely stay there again!;4;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
297;10/11/2011;ncWCyqR0Em8cSnVbHttpmw;otSHpPYQXHdU56giRmMBGQ;Worlds collide.  Old dog, new tricks.  In a nutshell, well done Ian Schrager, well done sir! I have always been a fan of the Ian Schrager Hotel group and I was thrilled to hear that they were opening in a grand old dame of properties, the former Ambassador East.   I wasn't quite sure how a finger on the pulse, New York second kind of guy would treat the aging beauty but I was dumbfounded by the gentle transititon that holds true the elegance of the days of grandiose with slick and contemporary style. Gratefful a dear friend was touring with an old school rocker that was housed in this gem and got to take a mini staycation while hanging out with rockstars.   So yes, the Pump Room was not my Grandma's cocktail salon and Kup and Harry Caray were just hovering from the heavens above but it was a definitely a hot crowd full of "all the young dudes" and lots of smoking hot beauties holding court.   Staff was fantastic as is expected from the Rockit Ranch crew and service was fast and furious. Rooms were spacious for a Schrager property says the girl who has spend extended stays at Paramount, Royalton and Morgans in my day.   Like double the size.  Ikea like in nature but sleek and comfy none the less.  Exquisite linens and lux robes and towels were my saving grace.   I will note I mistook a mirror for a door at one point and may or may not have lifted it off the wall but we'll leave that for later.   Staycation was amazing....... Public rooms are exquisite with soft yet sleek design elements, engaging staff and absolutely gorgeous finishes.   Clean, chic, sophisticated cool.  Worlds collide.  In a nutshell: old dog did new tricks quite well.;5;5;2;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
298;12/6/2011;fNW;FPggU_u2Es0YOTNM_8Xucg;The wife and I stayed here for a night as a reward for not going insane after being cooped up with our newborn for three months.  Yes, probably a Holiday Inn would have been quite fine at that point, but i tend to believe i am a good judge of things, and the Public Hotel deserves my accolades.   The staff were incredibly friendly to start.  The lobby was beautiful, with lots of places to relax if you needed a break, but didn't want to be in your hotel room.   The hotel room, which was reasonably priced compared to some other local hotels, was really cool and modern.  They did a nice job with the old bathrooms, without having to completely redo them.  The bed was cozy, and the bath products were top notch.  There was a nice flat screen with an easy to use operating system.  My only complaint on the room was that there was a gap between the door bottom and the floor, and when our neighbors returned to their room at 5AM (must have been a good night), we heard their whole conversation through their and our closed doors.  I opened the door and knocked on theirs and asked them to keep it down. We ate at the restaurant that evening, and the food was excellent.  I had the Pork Tenderloin and my wife had their Weiner Schnitzel.  The Schnitzel was outstanding.  They also had a good wine list, however later i found out the glass of $12 Chardonnay i was drinking retailed for $10.99 a bottle.  That is some mark up. After dinner we had another drink in the lobby which turned into a total 40 to 60 year old meat market.  We went to sleep early, but i hear the crowd gets younger as thee night goes on.  It was good people watching anyway. Brunch in the morning wasn't bad, but next time i will meander over to the Original House of Pancakes off Rush street. We also loved the location of the hotel.  It was in a quieter area, but only minutes from the action by foot or by cab.   We would definitely stay here again.;4;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
299;3/16/2012;8VDUgWHVsxvGzM-Yx8S56g;Dh6mZcoWplEQEDfobjMgRA;Wow. If zero stars was an option thats what I would have.  I really cant say one good thing about this place except that their food is ok.  If you're looking for a hotel and not just a good restaurant do not stay here.  Being from New York and knowing what Ian Schrager is capable of is clearly not a good thing.  Our expectations were high and this place didnt even come close. The 24 year old staff was completely unhelpful.  In all honestly, you could get a better bathroom at a Holiday Inn.  There are a lot of great hotels in Chicago, don't let a reputation like Schragers lead you away from them.  This hotel was a waste, felt unfinished and was an overall lazy effort.;1;2;0;2;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
300;12/18/2011;WYayMO;Ws7MrWPecTyAJIzZZvyluw;Stunning hotel. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. Room was 'ok', taking on a minimalist decor which i did not mind as much as the lack of comfort i experienced, particularly on the bed. Had breakfast in the restaurant once. Great food, good service and gorgeous setting, but I noticed they put up a 15 minute fuss when I wanted to pay in cash for what was a little more than a $20 meal. i didnt really quite understand what the fuss was all about. Sure, most customers will pay credit card for most payments, but surely a hotel establishment will make arrangements to accept cash as a form of payment. Really? I did think that was was totally ridiculous. They also made me wait 10 minutes before being seated when the restaurant was completely empty:table for 1 that is. However... coffee bar is fabulous with very yummy treats and a beautiful seating area with chess boxes and books to enjoy with your coffee. Excellent location. So close to everything you need.;4;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

This is true Ian Schrager style and cool charm without all the glitz and spangles and at a REASONABLE price point! Hotels seem to be reaching the breaking point with their prices for rooms these days.... The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable! EVERY employee, from the door man to the cleaning staff were most knowledgeable about the space, it's history as well as helpful and charming in their own way.

I am sorry that you had trouble with the sound for the party and with the bathroom incident in your guest room. Because I would really like you to return to the hotel and hopefully keep us in mind for other events or hotel needs, we would be happy to waive the cost of the speakers completely.  Everyone seems to have a different story but I enjoyed working with you and would like to do so in the future. I will have a revised invoice sent next week when accounting returns. Happy Holidays and please let me know if I can be of further assistance.;2;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

I don't love everything about this hotel -- the modern face-lift on old infrastructure shows through sometimes -- but it is a great hotel at not-unreasonable rates. They also have free wifi, which every hotel in the world should offer, but for some reason many still charge $10+/day (crazy).;4;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
306;4/23/2012;ZONiritFrUKUnuijwtazqQ;bBYtcB1HaV4kqYkpKZ-VcQ;I was initially excited about this hotel, but after staying here a couple of nights, I was disappointed. We had a 2 room suite, and while the rooms were large, the bathroom  was tiny for the size of the suite, but it had two walk-in closets. Who needs that? Go figure. Also, if you drink coffee, there is no coffee maker in the room, forcing you to order room service at $7-9 dollars a pot. No hair  dryer in the room, and minimal toiletries. They didn't even replace them the next day. We had requested a room early on the highest floor and they gave us one on the 6th. It has 17 stories, I believe. Also there is not even any complimentary coffee in the lobby. I went to the bar area to buy some. $3.50 a cup! I just went and got some down the street at Starbucks. Also, no exhaust fans in the rooms. On, the positive side, the lobby and Pump Room were renovated well, and full of trendy people on Friday and Saturday night. The staff was nice and efficient, good customer service for the most part. The drink prices are on the high side, even for Chicago. Would I stay here again? No, there are much better places in Chicago.;2;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
307;5/24/2012;Zkd4LJOykncycy59hFFQ7g;XFkM7gH46acw3OWUxduTAA;Upon entering the hotel, I knew that I'd found my home away from home. It wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out there and with rooms decorated in creams and whites, I easily conjured heavenly and celestial images. The express lunch offerings are genius- I recommend the beef brisket sandwich. My husband declared that the morning coffee offered in the library is the best he's ever tasted. The freshly baked pastries, specifically the blueberry muffin, is a must for getting your day started. The gym, though small, is well-appointed and had everything I  needed.  The staff is warm, friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location nestled in a pristine residential area but close to the beach, and in walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and the action on State Street. If you're looking for a fun yet relaxing place to stay where you'll feel comfortable but not miss any of the Chicago's energy, stay at the Public Chicago.

So when it came to NYE I thought why not pick a new hotel and decided on Public Chicago. My gf and I were enamored with the place from the minute we got out of our cab. The  guys working outside to the clerks working the check in were very hospitable and friendly. We both loved the decor of our room. What's also nice is the hotel is near rush and division and not that far from Michigan Ave. Next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely stay here again.;5;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w

311;8/19/2012;lGXFcx4aRT5GDHKYcjBc-g;NAZBH_z65b3336FlxRjDZw;So I live just 12 miles North of here in Evanston, but decided to stay at a hotel off Magnificent Mile so I could be close to a conference a few blocks away. Pros: * Location (a few blocks from Ohio St. Beach:a few blocks from Michigan Ave.) * Relatively cheap for a brand name hotel close to Magnificent Mile * Good quality pillows * Cute (gimmick-y) chocolate chip cookie upon arrival Cons: * Unreliable elevators. At any given time, only 2 out of the 5 elevators will be functioning (sometimes only 1 at a time!). I've seen people waiting for 15+ minutes on the ground floor waiting for the elevator. I waited 5 minutes to catch the elevator from the 6th floor going down. This is unacceptable. * Spotty wi-fi. I paid to get wi-fi and not some trash that loses connectivity every few hours even though all my devices still say 'connected'. * Under-stocked hotel bar in lobby. It was my birthday and a colleague of mine wanted to buy me a drink--just about everything I wanted seemed out of reach given the supply here. TL:DR - Cheap given its location, but I wouldn't come back.;3;2;2;2;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
312;8/15/2012;RmLqxSp13pl;ZAaKzaauffR_GbOeQBMqIQ;If I am ever in Chicago again, I definitely will stay here. Our room was clean, comfortable and inviting. Every staff member was professional. Carolyn on the cleaning staff let us use the staff elevator when we mentioned that there were 3 full elevators that stopped on our floor and we had been waiting for about 10 minutes! I thought that was superb customer service. The location is very close to Michigan Ave and certainly within walking distance to Mag Mile.;4;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
313;9/23/2012;MmhfUwSNQMcARr-lgtejUw;v7Ec9373pSa6W_IvA8fi7Q;I would give this hotel a 3.5. Having visited Chicago many times and having stayed in several similar hotels, this offered a larger room than we usually have in Chicago. The location is near pretty much everything downtown and has two bus stops within a block. My complaint would be that they came by to service the room at 8:45 am. Naturally, being on a trip for leisure, we were not out of the room at this time, but didnt have the do not disturb on the door because we were planning to be out by 10. Unfortunately because we were not ready for the room to be serviced at 8:45, it was not cleaned! This happened two days in a row. It just seems senseless to me to not plan to clean rooms that will remain occupied for a few more days later than 8:45. I didnt have any of the issues with the televisions (big flat screen in our room) or elevators (fast and always available). I would definitely stay here again, but would have had a better experience if the room cleaning had been different.;3;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
314;5/16/2012;b7lx38WH3k6pu4Nk5vwi4Q;ZyPy5lpRwcar77OcXqSsaA;I did this place last week as a little overnight get away. I also did not know that they damn restaurant show was in town as well and half the show was booked in that hotel. Anyways, it's in a fantastic location and everyone I dealt with at the hotel was extrememly nice and helpful. It was a horribly rainy day when we arrived, but the lobby was spotless and fresh smelling. We were checked in quickly and got our free cookies... WOOHOO!! (Got one later too!) The room was spotless with a great view. Extememly quiet and the bed was like a cloud. So much that I took an quick hour nap and forgot who I was... or was that the Jameson...  Up, out and on the town to the Cubs game for an awesome night and wrapped it up with a free breakfast in the hotel the following morning. Again, good tasting, clean, plenty of staff and friendly!;5;1;1;1;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
315;5/28/2012;ZdcXtYVcMygYNNmLn3gdmQ;q2NZ70jWHUkZVcC8Mj5tig;Good price in a great location (set back from Michigan Ave with easy access to it) with cookies when you check in. Not a whole lot else a gal could ask for! Room was spacious and tidy, and the bed was comfortable. The shower was also great and service was helpful when needed. Hotel has also recently been remodeled which is nice. The lobby has ample seating and a cozy feel. Breakfast is not included(no surprises here) but there is an Einstein's in the lobby if you need to grab a quick bagel or a coffee (though there is a coffee maker in the room as well).;3;0;1;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
316;7/31/2012;dF9ETAI0u5ksMzBxMnX6EQ;Z1XTox_tmK7y1GM3RQHkVg;Nice hotel in the right location. They are currently doing some renovations but I didn't feel like it got in my way at all. Try Timothy O'Toole's Irish Pub across the street for some really good bar food.;4;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
317;3/19/2012;y3oia0-Yb0DPhugePyhvJw;gfY-BGAJMINto1WK8w6orw;My best friend hates to fly...She even hates it more when the flight lasts more than two hours. A flight to Chicago for us was about 4. She decided to go around this by booking us on a red-eye out, hoping she could pass out and wake up refreshed in Chicago....Perfect plan, except..... Our plane touched down in Chicago at 5:45am...Most hotels don't let you check in until 3pm. This was going to be interesting. We arrived at Doubletree shortly after and were greeted by the front desk person...Or maybe "greeted" is too generous. I'm pretty sure he kinda just nodded. Hmmm. We asked if there was anyway to check in early but he explained that they were completely booked solid and he didn't have anything available. I asked if we could get a room once people started checking out and he told me, "I don't know, you're going to have to get with the first shift about that" Huh? I don't speak hotel lingo, but I'm no idiot. He basically said, "I don't care, it's not my problem but the next shift might care and want to fix your problem" Whatever. We checked our bags and hit the pavement. Great location....comfy beds....and cookies....Einstein Bagels downstairs with my favorite coffee.....Pluses! I couldn't 4 star this joint because of the busted elevator, or maybe it wasn't busted but there was only one that worked at any given time....took forever.....sardine can style every ride no matter what time of day or night... And of course the douchey night audit guy we met our first morning there...what a miserable little person. If you can avoid this d-bag and get lucky with the elevator, I would recommend this property.;3;0;0;1;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
318;8/4/2011;Sq72Dc0fCFKG-IEkMrn6DQ;Rjd9Td7yYOqu0A1e2KDAyA;3.5 stars. I want to give this place higher, but a couple of things just didn't cut it. Let's start with the positives, then move to the negatives. Pros - location: near Michigan Street a couple bus stops, which help - cookies: try them & you'll understand - lobby w/ free wi-fi - nice gym (open 24 hours a day) - comfy beds - nice pool Cons - my parents & bro/sis had a hard time getting extra toilet paper - the maid service took all day - a shower leaked/broke and took a while to fix - a charge for wi-fi in the rooms per day Overall we were pleased, but if you take the location away it might just be 3 stars. We got a pretty good price and we weren't in the hotel much anyways. I'm thinking I wouldn't mind staying there again if I visit, but I'd probably take my chances on Priceline and see what I get.;3;2;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
319;11/26/2011;ozBfY4JJ7V-W7m7O0vXOrQ;QrkbTD41gDOYvhhNix135A;Pro's - Einstein bagels in the lobby - Warm cookies when you check-in - Great restaurants/bars nearby (Timothy O'toole's, West Egg Cafe & Gyu Kaku) - Close to Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier and all the stores - Free wi-fi in Lobby - Decent price. We got it on Priceline for about $120/night Con's -Doesn't include continental breakfast -The smoking floors are AWFUL!! Cannot believe people can smoke in hotels there - 3 out of the 4 nights we stayed there our "do not disturb" sign disappeared in the morning and the maid woke us up....not a happy camper!! - Walls are thin so we heard the man next door to us coughing/throwing up two mornings in a row;2;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
320;5/25/2010;kjDm7mjcL5cACBDfYMPoJQ;DsRGk9IUdzmu5Ko3seIdwQ;HORRIBLE!!!  Management is to blame!   1.  No doorman was on staff to help open the door despite the amount of luggage I had... CORRECTION!  There was a doorman, but HE CHOSE TO IGNORE ME!! 2.  RON, the front desk guy informed me it wasn't his problem that no doorman was on staff... Thank you! 3.  COFFEE MAKER?  Seriously, do you check your rooms before admitting new guests - you have a fridge but I can't keep anything in it?? *** After making a request for one, you STILL MAKE ME WAIT 30mins plus for it, WTF?!/! 4.  Air Conditioner - OMG!!!  That thing is loud!!  When I said LOUD I mean seriously loud, waking up in the middle of the night loud! 5.  STARCHY Sheets!! I don't understand, some downey wouldn't hurt. 6.  Modern Decor completely misses the ball, the burgundy, green & brown combination was not doing this place justice... (if there was any for this place!!) DON'T STAY HERE!!  It's really not worth it!  I have stayed at many hotels such as Swissotel and Fairmont and NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING was THIS BAD!!! I wish the management would train their employees to be more friendly, help each other out and remind them that they are their to service their guests!;2;2;0;1;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
321;3/19/2009;UeDwluRnw1CNUA8nxWkweQ;5ITdf0mnklCpIUenv-5LWw;My daughter and I stayed here on Tuesday night while in town visiting another daughter who is moving to DeKalb with her husband.  The Doubletree had a great special mid-week price of $90.  The hotel room was clean and had a lot of extra amenities -- such as Neutragena SPF face cream and cleanser along with the usual shampoo, conditioner and body lotion.  Also, you are greeted upon checkin with warm, fresh chocolate chip cookies. Didn't try the workout room, but it looked very adequate.  The hotel staff is friendly and anxious to please. The parking was expensive - $41 for about 24 hours - but that is expected in Chicago.;4;1;1;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
322;7/28/2011;q0iRT66VcswagOcLDeZhjw;UTY_VkO8zL5hQBTSkPSsZA;I had no real experience with the Doubletree, but seeing as it was a Hilton, I had some expectations.  Upon inspecting the website, the rooms looked very sophisticated and modern.  When arriving the main lobby was very spacious, smelled amazing and had many friendly employees to help out.  They gave us our free cookies and kept them coming throughout the stay.  However, once arriving to our floor (4th), the experience started a downward spiral.  The hallway was not air conditioned, and extremely muggy and hot.  Our unit was nice and cool, however did not have the flat screen television that was on the website, but our 27 inch tv was fine.  Other electronic snafus included the house phone on the nightstand not working as well as our mini-fridge having a sensory-based system so we couldn't even take out the items to keep our drinks cool.  There were also snacks upon the counter that the stated that it was electronically weighed and if you touch it, you will be charged.  Families traveling with small children must have a lot of charges!  The cleanliness of the bathroom was less than desired.  There was painted-over mold on the ceiling as well as chipping paint.  Likewise, there were stains on the wall above one of the beds.  The blankets were amazing and down, however the pillows were too soft and there were no extra blankets.  The satellite also went out multiple times, which was probably due to storms at least one night.   The location was very convenient and riding the CTA wasn't challenging at all.  Due to the few issues we had with cleanliness and electronics, I may be deterred from staying here again.;2;1;0;1;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
323;5/14/2010;32jEEL1;3KG84QgF_5lzW1uDMJOghw;I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent at this hotel. Three nights here and no qualms whatsoever. Awesome location. Within walking distance of Navy Pier, The John Hancock Center, and fabulous Michigan Avenue shopping. If you need to go anywhere else, ask the doorman (who's UNBELIEVABLY attractive) to hail you a taxi. Cool looking lobby with a bar. Adjacent Einstein's Bagels. Excellent staff who make sure you're feeling welcome. Cookies at check in - delicious ones at that. The front desk people here are great. Really friendly and took care of my stupidity of placing my roomkey next to my credit cards and BlackBerry. Very clean, with cute rooms that are decorated nicely. Super comfy beds! And the thing that I judge any hotel by...the water pressure for the shower was unparalleled. This hotel is a winner.;5;1;1;1;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

325;10/22/2008;wvs3v2aIsDtr86WpHRgWrA;C0RkWAPYK58ms-BLBrFCVA;I'm writing my review based on the overall experience I had with the staff and services of the hotel and the people that helped me make my wedding a HUGE success! Both ceremony and reception took place here in their LaSalle Ballroom and I will post pictures once I get them from my photographer.  The ballroom is decorated with beautiful chandeliers in an amber wash but the carpet, though new, is slightly hideous - but I guess hotels have to have "busy" carpets to keep the dirt from showing. Rebecca Kuzelka - the most amazing and organized wedding coordinator ever!  There is something to be said about someone who already has a full plate on her hands, yet she does an incredible jobs of making ME, the bride, feel like I am her ONLY account.  Her attention to detail, her proactive spirit to make sure I have not forgotten anything (when there is so much going on, only a professional like Rebecca can point out the little details that may have been overlooked).  I had 10 months to plan my wedding and unfortunately, the person that I signed the contract with decided not to show up to work one day and I was lost without a coordinator for over two months.  Rebecca took on the position in June and was on top of everything as soon as she started.  What also made it really easy was that her "style" was similar to mine - Minimalistic and trendy - so the way she executed her job was the same way I envisioned my wedding.  Of course, I did my homework and outlined everything I needed done and was worried that the actual day wouldn't go smoothly - However, the day was seamless and I put my FULL trust in her and she made my day the happiest day of my life (well almost, marrying my best friend was even better)!  She organized all my vendors, all the staff, ensured everyone was where they needed to be and had everything done before I even thought about it.  I couldn't have been happier! Ben - I guess he is the lead doorman - Wow - he treated my guests with a smile all the time, no matter how long his shift was!  Thanks Ben! Alfredo - awesome concierge - really took care of me and my out of town guests who probably bombarded him with questions and reservations of all sorts - Friendly and professional Chef Alfredo - Executive Chef - I had always wanted an Asian Fusion menu for my wedding because I knew that the traditional Chinese banquet would not suit all the palates of my friends. He welcomed all my suggestions to incorporate many of the Chinese traditions of a wedding menu.  We were able to include roast pork, peking duck, udon noodles, wasabi, ginger, enoki mushrooms, bok choy and fish into the menus and the food was incredible!  We requested medium rare filets for all who ordered it and they were all cooked PERFECTLY medium rare!  It's not easy to cook for 85 guests to perfection but all of my guest said that this was the BEST wedding meal they have EVER had in their life.  I think the Hors D'oeurves were really the star of the show, people couldn't stop eating them! Waitstaff during the reception - I don't remember the name of the head honcho there, but he was extremely attentive to our needs during dinner, making sure that we enjoyed our food and it was hot enough etc.  His wait staff was classy and elegant serving everything butler style in tuxedos and white gloves!  Loved it! Bridal Suite - We were booked into room 2616 which is the Michigan Suite - gorgeous city views with a HUGE dining table, wet bar, seating area for 10, a Murphy Bed - then adjacent to the room was the master bedroom and a giant bathroom with a standing shower and a bathtub fit for two.  Largely impressed with this and tastefully decorated (recently renovated).  It also had an alarm clock with iPod connections but the TV was outdated and no DVD player in the room.  Our king sized bed was super comfy and the murphy bed even, was AWESOME - my maid of honor slept there the night before and she has insomnia - even she was able to catch a couple hours of zzz's prior to the big day! I'm so thankful for the people at the Doubletree who made this a great day for us!  I recommend the staff and services of this hotel to anyone looking for a wedding venue in downtown Chicago.;5;7;4;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

So when I see a Doubletree in the Chi i decide to ask if I could get some cookies, and they were super nice. They gave us one for each of us (3) no charge. So 5 stars for that cuz those cookies are fucking incredible.;5;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

328;10/20/2010;YZ3kp3-VNcpCEMApFFun2Q;9Cqfe9nx6CtB6nkBx3JvsA;Nice property, $89/night on hotwire during a busy period in October.  Room with 2 beds accommodated 5 people (2 adults, 3 young kids) - no problem with the hotwire reservation.  25th floor, nice room, flat screen tv with real HD.  Nice location - walking distance to North Michigan shops or Navy Pier.  We used buses down to the museum campus and up to the zoo - no problems there.  Several breakfast places nearby and tons of restaurants in the area.  Had a nice stay, really positive for the price.;4;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
329;12/2/2010;0gTW1xmiynEbLtqzz6gTyw;1RuW0eKE6N_Z1zHQBsbCkw;Yes, the cookies at check-in are nice. The hotel is nice. I thought the room decor was actually better than the W Lakeshore which we had stayed at the week before. Clean. Employees were really friendly and helpful. It sucks that so many hotels make their guest pay for wifi, it's not very hospitable. It is available in the bar area though which is weirdly placed in the lobby. For a decent price I would stay here again and I guess that is all that matters.;4;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

Mad props to Chase, Ben, Antwan, and Rasheed. Also... LOCATION is AWESOOOME! Not too far and not too close from the main streets of downtown. Also close to the Magnificent Mile so if you ever feel like doing some last minute shopping, it's all within walking distance.;5;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

332;10/16/2010;HaMZZx1xIp3HvzONsw72ww;9FuI6hqODWjmyv0NvFGucA;As mentioned, great location. Staff was great, cookies are a great touch and a nice room. Also, a small thing, but I do like the Neutrogena products. I was kind of surprised that the nice HD TV offered no HD programs. I also see how the mini bar could create a problem with unknown charges as mentioned. I overheard a lady talking in the restaurant how she must have moved something on the weight-sensitive trays and was charged. I don't know why they have to set it up that way. It should allow for a delay in case something is picked up and examined. Maybe five minutes. I was also a little disappointed that the free breakfast with my Gold status with Hilton was only a continental breakfast and to get anything hot it was an extra $6. The free for Gold members at the Hilton Garden Inn up the street was much better. Nice and hot in the Weber Grill Restaurant. Not a bad stay at all, but didn't blow my socks off. If price dictated I would stay again, but might not if price wasn't a factor.;3;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig
333;8/13/2009;yMbUhShLMciaGj8Nn24X6w;OeJNu6ZSzi4cEC_HZoJBjw;We went thru Priceline and got a great rate on a Tuesday nite. Room was nice and clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was adequate and I liked the Neutrogena products. BE AWARE that the mini bar and snacks on top of the fridge are sensor activated so if you even lift something up to look at it, you get charged!!  We did notice in the hallway that a tray of room service food stayed in the same place for approximately 18 hours which I thought was a bit gross. It is within walking distance to many attractions in the area including Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Our only problem was finding a place to eat late at night close to the hotel- we were there for the Cubs/Phillies game which went into extra innings, so we didn't get back to the area til about 11:30pm and NOTHING was open - not even TGIFridays or ESPN zone. That info has nothing to do with the review of the hotel,  just general knowledge.  Thank goodness for the chocolate chip cookies we got on arrival, they got us thru the night, even though we were looking for appetizers and a glass of wine............;4;0;0;0;ia27sl8koyz1K3sX8kT5ig

I am all about great service and this hotel went above and beyond with it for sure! My hubby and I and another couple stayed here for a night on the town visit and we enjoyed our stay for sure!  Our room was clean and well kept!  The location is great.  We usually take the El to the city, and its about a mile from the Clark/Lake blue line station...I suggest you just walk it!  Right by the wonderful shopping on State street and the best part....GARRETTS POPCORN!  They have a flippin' vent to blow out their delicious popcorn smells to lure you in...sneak sneaky..but it works!   The hotel has a decent sized pool...not sure if they have a whirlpool, we did not see one.  The fitness center is nicely sized as well.  The location is right by several restauarants and a short walk/cab ride to even more! Downstairs their is the Viand Restaurant/Bar and there is a Starbucks and a little market for juice, snacks, sodas, etc. If you want to be in a great location with excellent service then this is the hotel for you!;5;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
338;7/31/2012;I5dccP69n9D2rQWpNE-zNA;jTlvFiQ-AtzGlb7QjARHnQ;So...for this review I decided to wait and see if I was less irritated and my memories of a wonderful night were more blurred by time. Not going to happen apparently. This review should begin with me finding a great deal at this hotel, one within walking distance of an L stop, Navy Pier, and super close to my dinner date destination. I made reservations, gave a credit card number and everything. In preparation for my romantic weekend, I called the hotel to ask about parking and other random questions. I got all the answers I needed from a super helpful desk attendant and gave a rave YELP tip accordingly. Fast forward to the actual weekend. We parked in the adjoining parking garage, no breaks on price even though you're staying with the connected hotel, at 9AM and started our day around town. After trekking our butts around all day, we finally got to the hotel and started to check in. Since this was a surprise for the bf, I was in charge. Let me take this chance to say they checked me in as the wrong person. They took my name, double checked that with my ID and charged my card. They said they'd put a "hold" on my card until the next morning when the bill was settled, but online banking and handy text alerts let me know they charged my card 2 minutes after checking me into my room. The odd check-in procedure where they welcomed me back (I'd never stayed there before), tried to have a reservation for one (when there were clearly two of us:I said we were celebrating a late Valentine's for God sake) and looked down right confused when I said I'd only be staying for one night, should have tipped me off, but I was ready to take off my boots and sit the f*ck down. The person it should have tipped off was the desk attendant checking me in. Regardless, they produced two keys for an amazing room. The satisfaction on my bf's face alone was worth the hassle, so far. We got ready for dinner, the concierge called us a cab and we were out for the night. Fast forward to 1AM. The bf and I return from the best steak dinner and drinks we've had in forever, we're a little tipsy and ready to pass out, snuggle style. This hotel uses keys to operate the elevator, safety first, hell ya. So we use our keys and get to our floor. (Note: the keys work). We get to our room and try my key. Doesn't work. Maybe I'm more intoxicated than I thought. Try my bf's. Also doesn't work. Flabbergasted and quickly sobering up, riding down to the lobby. After a bit of chatting with the attendants, we find out there was a mistake and they checked me in as the wrong person so they'd have to CHECK MY ID to give me new keys to the room. Security is one thing, but YOU let me into your hotel, charged MY card and have ALL of my things in your room, which I can't access because of YOUR mistake. A few weird looks from the staff and two new keys later, we were back in our room. They slipped the bill under the door sometime in the morning and apparently that meant we were checked out. Though that was not apparent to me, so I spent 10 minutes waiting in line to check out, only to have them look at me like I had five heads. The bottom line: parking is super expensive (9am Friday to 2pm Sat = $146) and super convenient for the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and has a decent location,  but the customer service leaves something to be desired.;2;2;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
339;7/30/2012;fWHa9dcSSTBlpkZfQEnVyA;ol3DyVzJznz9aZX8562MfQ;Stayed here on my anniversary.  Got a room with a king sized bed on the 17th??? floor. Love the close proximity to the Mag-Mile.  Love the free wi-fi as opposed to the Hilton, which charges you on a timer.   Super clean... control your own A.C.  Modern and with flat screen tv's.  Pull out couch was clean.  Spacious.   This place didn't have a personalized kiosk like other hotels, but it didn't matter because sometimes those kiosks aren't all that helpful anyway.   The only downside was something kind of funny.  The bathrooms don't have a fan.  Haha.   Tell the wifey, to wait it out if you drop a deuce...;4;0;0;1;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

342;4/30/2012;ghkw-jmwrNfp-jzPtusOcw;kpcD1C9-AxkHB2JtkLv0Mw;We picked this place for our one-year wedding anniversary, mainly because we're cheap and wanted to use my husband's points and Gold status to our advantage. I noted in the reservations what we were celebrating because I'm a glutton for free stuff- I can't help it! Everyone loves an anniversary...! Our check-in was smooth and they could not have been friendlier. I wish I remembered the names of the people we worked with, because they hooked us up with a room on the 23rd floor and a lake view, and when we got back from our night out on Friday, we found the front desk staff had sent up a really sweet card and piece of cake, congratulating us. So awesome! The attached Starbucks was super handy, the rooms were small but comfortable and we were central to everywhere we wanted to go- everything was a short walk away. One hiccup to our stay was housekeeping, we were gone Saturday from 10 am- 4:30 pm, and our room wasn't touched. They got us fresh towels as soon as we asked, and it's not like I make my bed at home, so this was a minor issue. Also, they had charged us for parking ($42 a day, W.T.F!!!!) even though we flew down. Whatevs, the cranky Sunday front desk woman eventually took care of the charge... she also messed up our late check out, but since I'm so kind and flexible, it wasn't an issue :) This place is no frills and not cheap if you don't have points, but it seems reasonable enough for the location.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!;5;0;1;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
343;4/13/2012;AFq;k3ICHfTb433rFxAO3BsqEg;Was in town for a week for a convention and decided to stay here primarily to build up my Marriot points.  I was very happy with my stay here.  It's very nice to be able to walk a block west and enjoy the Michigan Ave. shopping.  It's also a very short walk from one of my favorite places, Corner Bakery.  The rooms were very spacious (no different from any other big-city downtown Marriott) and the staff was incredibly helpful.  I bought a few groceries at the nearby Whole Foods and realized while I was there that my room did not have a refrigerator.  I called the front desk and they were able place one in my room before I walked back!  Even better, as soon as I walked into the lobby the concierge said, "Mr. Etim, you'll find the refrigerator you requested next to the television."  Take a bow. The attached restaurant, Viand, was okay - the eggs and sausage were a little pricy compared to other restaurants a few blocks away.  Will definitely consider this place for a possible vacation stay.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
344;6/26/2012;evB37VU7A-cmmA3KWdhSzg;UHQTSojUNfkEMzmPaxMe-Q;Jerry K. wrote and offered apologies for my bad time at the Marriott. I have great respect for that!  That's class, Jerry!  Thank you for taking the time.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
345;2/21/2012;keHVRTzC9lBHcLQ0rDuEfA;zyk-YPhtFZK6kkbpzEKrWw;We treated ourselves (for a change) to a centrally located hotel in Chicago this past weekend.  We chose the Courtyard Marriott because it is relatively affordable for Chicago and it's known brand name.  They offered a military discount which was great.  We paid for parking (pretty common in the big cities) and chose to self-park, which was entertaining as the garage was extremely tiny! The staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was big and very clean and comfortable.  We had a nice view as we were up pretty high.  It wasn't noisy in the hotel and the beds were heavenly.  Plus, they get an A+ for having curtains that actually close all the way over the windows! My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge, which was a bummer since we had a lot of leftovers we wanted to eat for lunch the next day. All in all, this was a great hotel and in a really perfect location.  A short walk over to Rush, Navy Pier, the river, downtown, and the Red Line.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
346;1/2/2012;roTo6fjTtSaDCPm4sq-5MQ;kMsX9ZxCfwgjZDEdCDej9Q;Great location for our New Years Eve stay (2 days). Michigan Avenue a 15 second walk away. Navy Pier 3 blocks away. Garrett Popcorn right next door. I even noted a Saki bar across the street. The pool (10th floor) is one of those "why even have a pool if it is this size"? A Starbucks in the lobby...but I recommend better coffee at half the price at the Dunkin Donuts across the street. Not much of a view in our room (could see a slice of Michigan Avenue). Went with the larger size suite...which worked out well as we had 7 (2 were the grandkids) in the room.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
347;3/24/2012;cmT8yD7lCzWqwiIRwtJjkg;iq3eRRwhLUggIj0YXU9QsA;When I stayed there, I was surrounded by smoke. I couldn't leave the hotel without a line up of smokers blowing their smoke in my face. They set up a little cafe and the other guests light up next to the door, sitting down and puffing away. I tried to sneak out the starbucks side entrance, and that was next to their official smoking area and eqqually bad. I knew I had to worry about air quality in Chicago, I just didn't know it would be from my hotel!;1;2;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
348;11/23/2011;iH2cgzuYK9kEAC2wiS8B;2eCTQoBJETQSU-Oi9gjyuw;I generally like Marriott properties and this location is no different. When working in Chicago this location is perfectly situated for me.  I have visited the CMMM a few times and hvae usually been pleased, however, my last visit left me a bit disappointed. The a/c in the room was not working and it was unbearably hot. Despite giving maintenance an entire day to sort things out we arrived back to a stifling room on our second night. We managed to get a decent temperature by opening the windows but then had to deal with street sounds all night. I'll give them another chance but if they drop the ball again it will be our last visit.;3;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
349;7/6/2011;XAWuQDli0EkTf-0OccjfRA;6HtTEfnTrUlVhZN-mwV1Jg;Stayed here for a convention and I walked away very impressed and pleased! The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms are spacious with comfy beds. My room had two doubles with each bed decorated by five soft pillows each. Tenth floor has an indoor pool, gym room, guest laundry (1$ for each load. Front desk has free detergent and laundry sheets), & microwave. The restaurant, Le Viand, even offers Turducken as a special every once in a while! The hotel is centrally located and just a few blocks from Hancock Tower, Navy Pier, and lots of great food shrines!;5;2;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
350;3/29/2011;8fjN4n3x1lSgWSquRWkGYg;dLMMJAyI-4dqexuB65wcIQ;I have a personal understanding of the hospitality industry and I know how hard the business really is. This is why I'm super impressed with my stay at this Marriott and plan to write a personal email to the front desk managers to honor some extraordinary staff members of his such as Crystal Kwak and John. My stay at the hotel began with a sour note, due to my flight delay i didnt not arrive until 11pm and came to find out that there is no room at this marriot for me even though I have a confirmed reservation. John, the front desk staff, explained the situation and a room was quickly rebooked for me at James Hotel which is just 1 block away. Without me requesting it, a staff member, Rick, walked with me to James hotel for safety measures. Exhausted from 15+hour of travel, my stay at the James hotel was a pleasant one. The next day, when I "re-check in" at the front desk I was greeted with Crystal Kwak, an assistant front desk manager. I told her my name and she had the look immediate that she knew me, she told me how sorry she was to know that I had to get re-booked to another hotel last night and that she's so glad I'm staying here now. Her warmth and sincerity resonated with me and I, too,  was glad to be back in Marrriott. Afterward unpacking my bags, I had a surprise room delivery of a complimentary bottle of Merlot, 2 iced bottled water and a large box of mint chocolate. Needless to say, I went back to Crystal the next day and thanked her personally to make my stay a pleasant one. This hotel has amazing location, close proximity to just about everything, staff is courteous and thoughtful, and this is for an extremely busy hotel that's buzzing all the time (yes even at 11pm!) Which only makes me appreciate all the personal touches even more because it's easy to forget a customer's value in a sea of customers but they didn't do that. I would come back and stay here again and would recommend this hotel for your downtown Chicago stay.;5;1;1;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
351;5/17/2011;YKIHdvW1k6CZxW2bCf5now;b8EnjL9DwA6rNDQ9yoIwWg;Stayed here for a work trip recently. Pros: Friendly employees, great location (one block off of Michigan St.), clean, simple and spacious rooms. Also free WiFi and ethernet cable internet access in the room. One other bonus nice gym and an indoor pool. Cons: I thought it was a little pricey $189 for the quality of the room, but it might have been high because it was a large convention. And their currently under remodel, so weekdays from 9:30 AM on, it's a little noisy. Hopefully you're out and about by then. Overall: If you want a Marriott Hotel close to the Magnificent Mile this place is great.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
352;5/25/2009;nz;e7u5xhcLAt-D6mVHngKxQQ;Excellent~ Right at the heart of Chicago Downtown... The best Hotel Rate you can possibly find in the 100 yards of diameter... The quality services is the best feature of the hotel... From the front door~ to the front counter~ From the Concierge~ to the reservation management~ Though they claim themselves to be 4 star rating but, you truly get your money worth as 5 star experience Spring in Chicago is just fabulous~ and claim this cozy place for home, for a week, was the best part of my trip in Chicago!;5;5;4;4;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
353;10/10/2009;UqswXNfhn7aaBFUYXz1E6A;hWDybu_KvYLSdEFzGrniTw;A rather forgettable hotel, I'd even forgotten that I stayed here a weekend ago until I was going through receipts. Because of business, I was delayed checking in until 6 AM. (Yes, 6 AM. Yes, business.) At the front desk, I was told that they had cancelled my reservation because I hadn't shown up. I pointed her to my watch and indicated that it was still before check-out time, so I'd please like my room. I also mentioned that I have Platinum status with Marriott. She quickly reinstated my reservation and checked me in. The room was just right for a Courtyard with a view looking west. Oddly, it was two separate windows with one of the support pillars in between. After crashing for a few hours, at 2 PM I took the "do not disturb" off the door and headed back to the client. Returning much later, the room had not been done up. I was too tired to complain. The little tent card in the room clearly said that rooms are cleaned until 5 PM. Oh well. Bed? Comfortable. Room? Clean. Bathroom? Clean and stocked properly. Would I stay here again? Probably.;3;3;2;3;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
354;6/15/2012;htKuaJ;Q0t77DRukg8kKo7j9cDvAg;Good location with good amenities. Service was very attentitive. Restaurant menu for breakfast a bit boring. The room was nice, 24 th floor in the corner.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

We way overpayed for it, though, but the entire city was booked, so I guess that's what happens when you procrastinate. The employees were great, the bed was adequate and at least didn't have that horrible foam comforter thing that you occasionally encounter. Not really much else to say.;3;2;3;1;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

They could have charged anything they wanted and they gave me a great rate. I have been at the Marriott on the mile and it was not as nice as this place was. Such a good call. I love how close it was to everything. Will be staying there again. The parking was great and desk service was the best. PLUS room service rocked!!!!;5;2;2;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
357;8/31/2010;MnAMtBRSO6AumAz;7ks1xim2bO1_Q4VuakvLwg;I found this hotel surprisingly luxurious. Maybe it's because I had been living in a college dorm the past 7 months, maybe it's because I checked in at midnight and was exhausted, maybe it's because I had been having a stressful few weeks, maybe it's because this was my first time staying alone in my own hotel room and I treasured the privacy and freedom. I don't know, but upon entering my room, I felt almost as if I were at the Ritz. No doubt, however: this _is_ a very upscale Courtyard, despite being no pricier than usual. My room and bathroom were spotless and actually glamorous under the incandescence and the city lights, if that makes any sense. In the daytime, the room would look less relaxing. That's okay:I left early in the morning, anyway. Seriously, for $80 (weekend rate) and a free $15 Visa gift card (Marriott promotion), I was completely blown away.;5;1;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
358;3/5/2010;nAsW5OOQGtBXeEciGc;LCWqR7cL0CCO8ZBBzHG2mQ;This is not the average Courtyard. The rooms are pretty typical in terms of layout, cleanliness and quality. The location is in downtown Chicago, so you can get to a ton of restaurants and theaters easily. They do have a full service restaurant and bar, which you normally don't get at the Courtyard. Because they have a restaurant on-site, room service is available. They also have the usual courtyard market and a mini Starbucks.   They also have a doorman.  I really don't like this because I have to tip the guy $1-2 bucks every time I get in or out. He hails a cab for me, but this is downtown Chicago. You walk outside and put out your arm, three taxis show up:pretty much any time of the day.;4;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
359;12/3/2010;bobPi0K6LZOj3e4aOoVZVw;Ckit_yBrG5ZcEpP_XieFvQ;I had my wedding at the Courtyard Marriott and it was great.  The Marriott hasn't done too many weddings so I was really afraid to put my trust in them, but the end result was amazing.  Looking back on my photos just confirms it.  My guests can't believe how great the food was.  We had our ceremony and reception at the Courtyard, the reception was in Viand (the restaurant in the hotel), which is a perfect set up for a smaller wedding.  There is a new events coordinator who came in at the tail end of the planning (mine left with barely any notice- Bride's worse nightmare) but she seems to really "get it" and will probably help build their portfolio of weddings. Michelle and Melissa in Sales were great.  The hotel just renovated most, if not all of it's rooms and all of our guests loved it.  They gave us great upgrades as well. The banquet captain, Alfredo definitely worked with us to make the day great which is the key thing to find in a venue. The food again...amazing! One of my guests when they RSVP'd wrote "best menu option ever".;5;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
360;6/8/2011;uaL;0ZFVcSw86KQ56LanwaB9nQ;Excellent choice of hotel in Chicago with courteous staff, spacious rooms, great location, and free wifi and business center (as it should be!) I lived in Chicago for four years and was thrilled with the location.  It is just north of the river - 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, Mag Mile Shopping, and most importantly Gino's East, Frontera, Giordanos, and other great dining spots.  It is walkable down to Millennium Park/ Art Institute  but allow for a good 20 - 30 minutes. The staff was courteous but not in a robotic manner.  Very approachable and if they didn't know the answer, they were happy to look it up.  They also demonstrated empathy.  Came in on a red eye on a very busy weekend (35K people in Chicago for a conference) and they gave us a room right away at 7am without any fuss.   The rooms were standard for any hotel chain - comfy beds, good tv channel selection, etc.  We were fortunate and got a top floor room overlooking the lake and skyscrapers.  If there was one thing I would have liked, it would have been complimentary bottle water to take on the road or to make coffee with in the morning - only because Chicago tap water has a slightly chlorinated taste to it.  Also, the bottles of conditioner and shampoo were on the smaller side - enough for me but my wife needed more. I LOVED the fact they didn't charge for WiFi nor for use of the business center to print boarding tickets, maps, etc. On another occasion, I ate at Viand and it isn't bad - seems to be a popular function spot.  (At the same time though, there are plenty of other great restaurants within close walking distance).   In summary, the courtyard has the best of all worlds: good location, free useful amenities, approachable staff, AND one can actually earn points for a stay.;5;0;0;1;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA
361;2/19/2008;pJDCqEidgZuanfSPGBoHSQ;BTFWoaw8w7ABMhoWYkCpqA;I stayed here once by accident - because I had reserved THIS Courtyard instead of the one on 30 E. Hubbard. The room was fine and the location was fine. I just didn't really like it because it felt like the hotel was in the land that time forgot.

362;4/12/2010;-M8V3wk6g5hlBy7RjkybmA;d16klT9OKoAiZn10I6E-hA;I've stayed here twice now and would go back in a heartbeat.  If I'm looking to save money in the city and still stay at a central place in a nice clean hotel, this is it.  The rate was great (around $150 I think).  The restaurant next door (Viand) is connected on the inside and you can bill your meal to the room.  They also do a decent breakfast.  It's close enough to go for a run on Lakeshore and close enough to shop on the MM.  Great restaurants are all walk or short cab ride away.  The room was exactly what you expect from Marriott and perhaps a little nice than some Courtyards I've stayed at in non-urban areas. Always check here before you book a room in the city.;4;3;1;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

364;10/21/2010;8LUBfqI0sscZo2XleJlhjA;fOTzYtBF4lJTwDIMfCAeyQ;Think "upscale Courtyard Marriott" is an oxymoron? You won't if you stay here. My stay here felt similar to my stays at hotels in Chicago with reputations for being more higher-end. Beds were plush and very comfortable, staff was super friendly and very accomodating, and the lobby was warm and inviting - complete with a fireplace, a giant jar of cookies, a bowl of crisp apples and a dispenser of apple cider. Very convenient location, just a short block off Michigan Avenue. (Though if you are watching your calories, be warned: Getting to Michigan Avenue from this hotel requires passing Garrett's Popcorn:be prepared to be very tempted by the waff of hot caramel!);4;0;0;1;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

366;1/13/2010;Zp8B6kZnjU3VnszS;RkLJiG7B1J_L7iaOlpqn8Q;I stayed at this hotel tons for business.  I knew the front desk folks by name, and they knew mine, too.  They made an extra effort to make my stays go smoothly (even before I stayed with them often). The Starbucks in the lobby is convenient if not the smoothest running location I've seen.  Remember that Courtyards are for business travel, so there's a concentrated rush in the morning. Viand has to be the best restaurant I've ever seen at a Courtyard.  High quality breakfast foods (sorry, never tried other meals) cooked to order (buffet on weekends I think). The staff are attentive and caring.  If you ask for a dinner recommendation they won't just give you a photocopy sheet like some places (though they do have a brochure)--they'll talk you through what you're in the mood for, and tip you off to newer places if you're into that. This is not a luxury hotel, as CY's are not, but the service is classy! I like that.;5;0;0;0;T_9IQ4nXSacMzrynX3pWJA

370;4/10/2012;mZJaTLN7AQ0XoyP9WDjGrg;_V6qMBCSzhwx96FLB3CJRw;If you're in Chicago for a conference and someone is paying for your room, it's very hard to find things to complain about. If you're paying for this room by yourself, then I'm sure you'll find more to complain about.   As far as the room being bland and boring...it's a hotel room.  Most of them are.  If there were dancing monkeys in every hotel room throughout the world and one didn't have a dancing monkey, then I'd be disappointed.  (no monkeys were harmed in the writing of this review, by the way). I also chose the green option and do not see the points...so shame on them. Some staff was very friendly and helpful, while others didn't know which way was up.  This did not make my boss happy. I didn't get any other food but if you are expecting a full Starbucks in the lobby, you're going to be disappointed.  It is severely lacking in options as well as hours open, but it does have the choice of cold cereal with milk if you are looking after your carb consumption. For some reason, my room and/or alarm clock was haunted as it kept going off EVERY NIGHT at different times.  Don't they check that to make sure it's off when they turn over the room- especially since many people nowadays (such as myself) use their phones as their alarm clock? The location to the John Hancock building can't be beat.  Sadly, many other things can. Not bad, but not the best I've had.;3;5;3;2;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

No problems with noise in the room like other reviewers. Else = Left something to be desired. The wifi wasn't too bad, but what REALLY got my goat?  No wired internet. Says there is but no.  There's a cable *on the desk* in the room, which I followed back (as an ex-IT guy I like to tinker) where it goes to a box and then nothing, nada, no other cable.  Lovely ruse, Starwood, thanks. Ha-ha! What a lark. I called the desk and the fellow a little too nonchalantly said "Well have you tried the Wifi instead?" Does something smell funny or is that the Chicago River? Stayed there for a medical conference of the g-friend's, she said her boss's boss professed they were very unhappy with the measly catering provided for what they thought was an exorbitant price. Room service charges were INSANE. $5 + 11% tax (ok, that's fine) plus 24% *service charge*!?  We had our meals paid for top to bottom, ate at some nicer places while down there, but even in a pinch we refused to pay such inflated rates. The prices at the bar downstairs were just plain over the top, too.  It cost me $19 for a beer and a shot, just a Goose Island 312 and a Ri rye. Never again. Not ever, ever, ever, ever. I would stay there again on someone else's tab or in a pinch, since it was comfy enough and we had a nice time, but the amenities and prices just didn't add up for us.;2;1;0;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

The written instructions for their eco program to skip housekeeping, and return the card are unclear. Perhaps I should've known to keep my card, and give it to the front desk rep when checking out. I interpreted it as giving several options, one of which to drop off in the room card box. Calling the Michigan Westin after my stay to request Starwood points didn't work since I didn't comply with the instructions. No Starwood points for this guest. I think there are nicer hotels to stay at in Chicago like the Palomar or W, than this Westin without sacrificing much for location.;2;1;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

In the interest of full disclosure, I just came back from a trip to Asia where I also stayed at three Starwood hotels (Sheraton Hong Kong, Sheraton Taipei, Le Meridien Taipei), all of which were far more superb, which may explain why I'm negatively biased in this case. First, the rooms are clean but BORING. White shower curtains, white sheets/comforter, and very bare walls. Two, there is a Starbucks downstairs which on their website says is open at 6AM, but no one was there when I went downstairs the first morning of my stay to grab coffee at 6:05AM. When I asked the concierge, he responded that it would be open shortly. A few minutes later, I see an employee hurry in preparing to open. When I asked her when they would be ready, she responded that they open at 7AM. WTF. Third, the hotel offers a "green choice" program where you receive either 500 Starwood points or a $5 voucher if you choose not to have your sheets/towels replaced for a day. I opted for this offer but didn't receiver EITHER points or a voucher when I checked out. Fourth, the room service charges are ABSURD:"$5 delivery charge, 24% service charge, and 11% sales tax." Despite having the luxury to expense my meals during my stay, I refuse to pay for such a rip-off.;2;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
376;6/22/2011;JP3qruylt68ktCZPQGZ3Dg;komqeuyKSNErTspXCtKAkg;stayed at the Westin on N. Michigan Avenue during Memorial Day Weekend. First off, we landed in O'Hare and took the subway to the hotel. After switching trains in downtown Chicago and walking 6 blocks we finally arrived at the hotel. There are only two things going for the Westin on Michigan Ave, it's location to shopping and the Westin Heavenly Bed. One of which you could get at another Westin or Starwoods property and the other via taxi. Check in was quick and since I am a "preferred Starwoods Member" I was told I was upgraded to a higher floor reserved for "preferred members". The room did not appear to be "preferred". It was directly behind the service elevators and I could hear the elevators operating all day and night. Luckily I brought ear plugs to wear while sleeping otherwise I would have gotten no sleep. Additionally, the rooms themselves are not quiet. You could hear anyone and everyone in the hallways (and there were lots of unruly screaming children running down the halls too). The room itself was on the smaller side, a king size bed, two night stands, a bureau with TV on top, desk and soft chair with ottoman. My one complaint about the furniture, which I don't usually comment on, was that there were not drawers on the nightstands only doors that opened to the space below. Additionally, there were no drawers in the desk either. The only drawers in the room were the 4 small drawers in the bureau under the TV. The other part of the bureau housed the refrigerator with stocked overpriced items. The bathroom was standard for a hotel room and appeared clean although the housekeeping staff never gave us an extra towel or soap or shampoo. Being a preferred member I also got free Wi-fi access, however, the wi-fi here was pathetic. I had faster service on my 3G phone than the wifi, it was a worthless benefit. A big beef I have with hotels is that the beds are not completely made. After sleeping in the bed once I once again found that the sheets did not reach the bottom of the bed and the mattress and the small mattress pad were exposed. I had to pull off all the sheets and covers so that the staff would correct it. Additionally, the Westin usually gives you extra pillows in the room, this Westin did not, however, housekeeping did provide us with a few extra pillows. Westin offers a workout facility in each of their hotels. I've been to some really nice hotel facilities and some not-so nice ones, this hotel ranks in the middle. They did provide dumbbells but had no cable machine and 4 plate type machines. There were also a couple of aerobic machines (treadmill/ellipticals) but not many. Our room did not have a view either. We overlooked another building across the way. As I stated in the beginning, the Westin Heavenly bed was the only plus to our visit. Would be stay here again? No, while we like Starwood properties, we would try another first. When you pay more money for a Starwood property, you expect higher service and quality. This property did not deliver.;2;4;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
377;2/5/2012;x1bf5Sc6QErMOmVBBRSr9g;rqJAs2YAAyXN4doLwUSbvQ;We stayed at the downtown Chicago Westin Hotel this weekend and had a great experience! The weekend price was very reasonable, rooms were average as far as decorating goes, but they had really great beds and bedding. My son needed emergency cleaning service on his suit and, voila! It was hanging in his room within a short time. The lobby is small but had plenty of seating-it gave the feel of a boutique hotel. Even though there was a coffee pot in the room with Starbucks coffee, we took advantage of the lobby Starbucks. The grill/bar had a warm old Chicago ambiance-great photos filled the walls and the light fixtures added to the flavor of the room.;4;2;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
378;4/11/2011;hcZYMPIbvfcm9k;QTaXh4nvR8BMLFbWcu1bRg;PROS: 1)The rooms were clean. 2) when we asked for extra shampoos they were delivered right away. 3) The building is in an awesome location. 4) You could leave your bags in the hotel after you checked out and get them at the end of the day. CONS: 1) Check in/ Check out line is huuuge. 2) Lobby is not the best. Overall, definitely recommended to friends!;4;1;2;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

380;2/19/2008;mwHVSEfuePNpu8Zwbp86bg;BTFWoaw8w7ABMhoWYkCpqA;This place was awful and I do not intend to go back even if the company is paying for it. If you sign up for a package and misread the fine print and don't ask a question and they stick you with a charge, that's your fault. However I called down to the front desk and asked them specifically if my room (rate schedule in hotel speak) covered Internet charges. They said yes on Friday, but when I checked out on Monday I was pleasantly surprised with several internet charges that they're not taking off. Also - if you're expecting to sleep soundly til say 9, you'll be awakened by the sounds of their maintenance and renovation crews drilling things into the wall or dropping things on the ground. Which is something they don't tell you about when you check in.   Yes the beds are comfortable but there's another Westin on River North that's really easily accessible. Or there's about a dozen other hotels that you can pick from along the Magnificent Mile. Don't stay here. If you have a reservation, cancel it. Tell them I told you to. You'll end up paying way too much to be disappointed.;1;7;1;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
381;11/14/2010;cjjDiNlbfvgXmT0DIUKd5A;OK4C8FONOju2D3RSBacB0Q;During the second part of our stay in Chicago we elected to stay at the Westin instead of going back to Hotel Felix - it wasn't a good decision. Service upon checking in was not welcoming nor helpful. Two bell hops had more interest in cracking jokes among themselves than assisting us with the check in process. Once we did check in and went to our room, it was nice but in need of a renovation. The lighting in the room makes everything look jaundiced. In our particular case, there was an annoying, loud fan blowing which could only be turned off by calling maintenance, which I did 3 times, with a fourth stop at the front desk before the matter was resolved. Internet service was not free and the connection was not good, lessening the feeling that this particular Westin had any interest in offering value or service to us as patrons.;2;2;0;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
382;11/28/2009;c0pgtms;l5Rsyr-GucrrabwCNuGzYg;So much for 30 days of Yelping. If I do three today though, it'll bring my average back up! Onwards! Nice place (seemed to be under renovation), but our room was weird. The toilet kept making noise and the shower wasn't working all that great. It seems like the water pressure was totally off. Usually that's not a big deal, if it's a $75 a night room...not a $275 a night room. Side note, Yelp! - I think the 'business tips' should be adjusted to reflect a hotel, not a restaurant  :-);3;3;1;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

385;12/29/2010;fzSiSnfWaoxb3JqL8QcIDw;wd_VNRXXGyoEUs-bMW5pGA;Great location..right across the street from a funky looking Cheesecake Factory.   Parking: Overpriced..try parking elsewhere or don't bother renting a car if you're staying in the central vicinity.  When it's nice outside, the walk around that area is nice. Rooms: Bed are comfy but I agree with other yelpers that they need some refurbishing.  Could be more updated for the price you pay.  Friendly staff and front desk.  Concierge gave us some passes for local nightlife around the area and the suggested places were fun.  Although the crowd was a bit random, I would still go back. Location: Prime location with lots of things nearby and local transportation.  Near many of the shops and a quick 15 minute walk to Garrett's Popcorn.  What can I say...a definitely PLUS!;4;2;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
386;5/1/2010;LxuSgUgzR71eOtlWzh6fRQ;LfLnJ3ekTmkuhwWKQcZSwQ;I'd really give this 3.5 stars if I could.  It was a little better than "OK". I'm kind of conflicted with this place.  The location is awesome.  Seriously.  There are plenty of places to eat and shop within a 15 min walk.  The area is very posh and clean - it's the Magnificent Mile for goodness sake! However, a few things kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  Some of them are things that the Westin could improve, others are just things you'd find anywhere in downtown Chicago and I should learn to deal with. First of all, forget self-parking unless you want to park at the Hancock across the street - even then I think you'll pay ~$40/day.   Parking at the Westin is $53/day.  I thought San Francisco was bad at $30 ish/day.  Oh well, that's part of staying downtown and it's not like the Westin is the only one price gouging.  OK, I'll move on. The rooms were small and boring - far too clinical for my taste.  Boring white walls, etc. The beds are awesome - that comes with the territory when you're dealing with Westin or the W. My bathroom had a faulty toilet. There was a TON of mold/mildew built up in the corners of the tub (both outside and inside).  What's disturbing is that they just tried to rub caulking over it rather than actually fix the problem.  I meant to take pictures and forgot.  However, feel free to visit room 949 and you'll get to enjoy it as well.  :p Wireless internet access is pretty awful (when you can get it to work).  It sucks being tethered to the desk but I had no choice most of the time. Room service prices were STUPID. Example: Small Cobb Salad and bowl of soup w/ glass of water.  $40.  WTF?  $5 delivery charge, 5% service charge, etc. They charged me double for parking on one of the days - that's $106 folks!  They fixed it of course. The front desk personnel are great - no issues with them at all.  I really liked the servers at The Grill (during breakfast).  They pretty much rocked and actually had a personality. So, if this Westin was in a worse location, I'd never return.  However, it is in a great location and they do run specials from time to time.  I just can't help but think that there might be better options out there for the money.;3;2;0;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
387;9/6/2006;B6YoWoKrRnCcFJsYx0fj6w;XDpH_eZVnKoKyVE1bxotSA;I really do like the Westin more than other business class hotels. The heavenly beds are fantastic, but they really need to figure out the heavenly shower thing. It's not that heavenly or different from other hotels. This hotel in particular was great! It has a prime location on Michegan Avenue, next to the John Hancock building. The only thing that I might complain about was the noise from the elevators (try to get a room away from them), but I won't dwell on that, because the staff was fantastic. They were very helpful and supportive during a very bizarre incident that involved my husband losing his mobile phone on the street and the attempted extortion from the crackheads that found it. The staff performed outstandingly, and, for that reason, I would stay here again.;4;2;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

I liked everything about the hotel except the room size...  Just a bit cramped but that is to be expected in downtown Chicago.  I have seen far worst too in NYC (the W hotel-tuscany for instance) and you will pay double for that space! I would imagine this is a great place for business along with personal ventures alike.;4;2;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
389;12/7/2010;iEVeVb8JUsiWDS60P7vzaw;BJX9Eu977goCdu1u-apumQ;I'd call this hotel a WINO (Westin in Name Only).  Every Westin I've ever stayed in anywhere has been a clear cut above this poser, but it seems Starwood gets to call this a Westin because of the spectacular, unbeatable location.  And that's the only reason to stay here: Location, the best in the city. Lobby and staff are okay.  My issue was the shabby rooms, uninspired and needing renovation.  While the bed is still "the bed" -- truly wonderful -- the rooms at this Westin feel like a mid-tier chain (Ramada, Holiday Inn).  And beware, light sleepers: These rooms are loud.  I vividly heard all hallway activity inside my room as if it were being piped in by speaker.  As I feared, hallway noise (door slamming, in particular) jolted me awake three times, and I woke up feeling lousy. The TV doesn't have a channel guide, so you have to turn to each channel to see what's on.  Like some other Yelpers, I too got locked out during my stay, trying to negotiate their 1990 door fixtures and locking system.   It's all about location in Chicago, and this one can't be beat.  But sadly and surprisingly, Starwood has allowed this hotel to deteriorate.  Even an average Westin at this location would be incredible -- I hope they pull it together because today, this hotel aspires to average.;2;1;0;1;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
390;12/6/2007;9HMobGn20uSe0SOBbINRLQ;Q7tEnPaEtZox7qetRFkmEw;I arrived 10:30pm last night to the Westin.  The beds were super comfortable and indeed heavenly.   The restaurant downstairs (aka "The Grill") is a bit generic as you would expect from a hotel restaurant.  I ordered the 18oz new york strip and it was tough!  For $80 (1 steak + drinks) I expected a much better experience.;3;1;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
391;2/13/2008;EQTOp5;CFNxTohUu5xr-mUPkBLT2A;Two stars may be a stretch. I live down the street, but my company was having a sales contest where  you could stay at the hotel for two nights if you won. So, the room was a sauna and we had to sleep with the window open each night. It gets two starts b/c the front desk was nice enough to give me an upgrade with a killer view of the lake. I was excited to use the Reebok Gym. For those who are not gym rats, these are great gym with TVs built into bikes, treadmills, etc. they have it all.  I went down around 6:30 and there was no water! I called and they said they would send it up. No biggie. I get on the exercise bike and there is only one that has straps. For those who bike, you know you need the straps, so I use the one with the straps and the TV does not work. I check the one next to it and the TV does work. I swap the straps. Start riding and there are only two channels. An hour into my work out and still no water. I called again and they said it would be right up. After 1.5 hours and no water I called it a day.   That night, I called the front desk to get a mini-bar key and they were so RUDE! I cannot believe how rude they were. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone until they get their act together!;2;2;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

Misc = 5+ star.  about an hour after checking in, we get a knock on the door saying we had room service.  and we didn't order any.  it was a suprise of champagne and strawberries - on the house - in honor of our wedding anniversary.  that was an amazing touch and had us smiling from ear to ear.

Inside was OK. Probably your usual Westin decor. Loud busy bar that I did not have a chance to try. Beds were very nice and plush. Room was poorly insulated from noise and I could hear some family yammering in Spanish either below or next to us. I expected better for a Westin. They also lied and said they would credit my Starwood account with points they missed but the credit never showed.   I always wanted to stay here and am glad that's now done and over with.;3;0;1;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
395;7/4/2011;o3TOCR3W4uJ;HroOuYzslPu4iYUyUizolA;As a frequent business traveler, I am usually very pleased with Westin properties, but my experience at The Westin on Michigan Ave was absolutely horrible. From the unnecessarily long line to check in to the hotel to the uncomfortable beds, my stay was not am enjoyable experience. The conference taking place at the time didn't add to my stay, as there were dozens of people taking over the lobby and the elevators, and led to a very cramped experience. Additionally, valet took forever and I had a hard time retrieving the packages I had been expecting. Never again will I stay at this hotel, especially because there are so many other great hotels downtown where one can actually be treated well.;1;1;0;2;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

The only things that did not suit me were the patented Westin Scent in the lobby which was like a song stuck in my head, and there was no onsite hotel bar, which is often the best place in a hotel.;4;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

398;3/22/2009;ZC69TUeEyYd40m3k1W8Mxw;IhmBr-yHC8xLjdnoq7O37w;Probably the best hotel stay so far. I'm generally unimpressed with the price to service ratio at these fancy-ish hotels, but I think this is my new favorite. Location: AWESOME. Right across the street from the Hancock Observatory and the Water Tower Place. There's no lack of food in the area, from cheap (mostly in the mall), to the more expensive, to the moderate (cheesecake factory). There's "The Grill" downstairs but it's pretty expensive. I took a cab to all the major landmarks for around 10-$15 (cabs seem to be rather expensive in this city, the places weren't very far away). Rooms: My room was great, I couldn't hear any neighbors and the bed was super comfortable. Room Service: Food was awesome, and I was surprised that when I got hot chocolate with my breakfast that it wasn't a couple packets and some hot water. It was served in a caraffe that stayed hot all morning. They also have EVERY necessity that you may have forgotten that you can have delivered to your room. Price: My room was discounted at $195 for an event, definitely worth it if you ask me. I was very pleased with my stay. The hotel was on a scent theme of "White Tea" so the corridors and everything smelled marvelous, and all of the in-room soaps and shampoos smelled like White Tea also (my favorite scent, btw). If I had to complain about anything it would be that during the day, the paid wifi internet is VERY slow, but I was able to hook into the wall for no extra charge so no big deal.;5;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
399;1/12/2009;iwKX-tNs02XOVYw0AOEFiw;c7gAWgH7pG72cNZ_mkRFsw;The main reason to stay here is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, next to Hancock and Water Tower. Ultimate location to start any Chicago adventure. The hotel is newly remodeled, quite nicely I must add as I remember the old version (Hellloooo, pastels!) Hotel lobby is uber modern and clean, but unfortunately the meeting rooms don't necessarily match that feel. Rooms have also been updated, and I'm sure there is a premium for a lake or Michigan Avenue view. Probably not for the wall view I got! Beds super cushy comfy with tons of pillows, key. Reception was more than cool with my request to extend checkout until 2:00 p.m. and no housekeeping knocking on my door (a pet peeve). Went to a large event here and the catering and event department did a great job. As far as I could tell, quite smooth considering they were serving 75 sloshed Irish firefighters and their rambunctious dates.;3;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

Unfortunately, it was a problem.  I got locked out of my room the last day of the conference, and to top it all off, I left my ID in the room.  I had to wait one whole hour for security to come by and open the door for me.  Then I had to run back down to the front desk and wait another thirty minutes in line to take care of my room cards. I was all set to go out for a night on the town before leaving, and it was interrupted by a problem that should have not happened.

402;3/16/2009;T1RHpI7s4ITx3pIu5nTYig;fb5MnCqLGyUXwcnJ8XW2CQ;Note: This is more a review for the hosting an event aspect of this hotel, not the staying here on vacation aspect. When I got engaged, I traversed the whole city in search of a reception venue that screamed "Chicago."  Originally, I was determined to have a non-traditional venue, but I begrudgingly checked out some downtown hotels-- and was really surprised at how much I liked the Westin. The ballroom looked out onto Michigan Ave, everything was inclusive of sales tax/service charge so the prices you saw were what you were charged (the 30% was not tacked on afterward like comparable downtown hotels), the decor was clean & contemporary without being too trendy, and best of all, it was nice but without the snootiness. (Seriously, I cannot stand pretentiousness!) The biggest gamble was the food as you sign the contract before the tasting, but it all turned out splendidly in the end. The food was awesome at the tasting and I was just praying it would be the same at the event-- and it was. People are still raving to us & our families about how great it all was, especially the steak. I can attest to its quality myself, as you bet your ass I made sure that I would be eating the meal I was paying for. :-) And while I didn't stay in a typical room, I did get a kickass suite to get ready in, and I took advantage of getting it at the discounted room block rate for the night before as well. Check-in wasn't until 3, but the room was ready for me at noon. It had an awesome view looking out onto Michigan Ave & the bed was plush & comfy-- super important for a stressed out insomniac bride-to-be! This is not your cheapest option for a Chicago wedding, but it truly is a good value for a downtown hotel right on Michigan Avenue, and less expensive than the nearby comparable hotels. P.S. If you do host an event here, and have the money upfront & can make the payments in full, get a Starwood Amex credit card. You'll thank me later. :-);5;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
403;8/31/2008;TxDbXh1foyCTZPcYxbveGg;pQE7nc_Uc0SmB1Depi9Iqg;DO NOT have your wedding room block here!!!!! We had our wedding room block here in August for our wedding (our wedding was not at the hotel though). We had nothing but issues, issues, and more issues. It was the biggest problem that we had in all of our wedding plans. The hotel itself is nice, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. I have no complaints about the quality of the hotel and furnishings. Our first issue was that we were misled about the nature of the room block. We were reassured that when the initial block was filled, we would be able to add 5 more rooms at a time, no problem whatsoever. What they failed to mention was that they would hassle with us about the room rate. Next issue, my grandfather needed a handicapped room. The reservation was made 8 months in advance, and when he checked in....no handicapped room for him. Had to wait 24 hrs. for a handicapped room. Unexcusable. Next issue, multiple guests were not able to check in by 3 pm. One guest had driven from Canada and was not able to check into her room until 7 pm. This was because someone was still occupying the room. They reassured her this person would be charged. They did not however offer her another room, or offer anything to her at all! Again, unexcusable. Next issue, the gift bags I provided for the guests were not properly delivered to the right guests. I had provided a typed, very clear list of which guests were to receive bags to the bellman (this is the Westin's policy). I had to speak with the bellman multiple times about gift bags not being delivered. I should not have to do this the weekend I am getting married!! The biggest issue...they charge $2.50 per gift bag. When I'm paying for this service, it should be done correctly. The service at this hotel is ridiculously unexcusable!!!;1;4;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

406;1/31/2012;1eJua2cNm8nsBJEYk6xtBg;ZIOJzxtpqGbkYg-wSVq0DQ;The hotel itself was nice, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient to shopping. If not for the following inconveniences and lack of service, I would probably give it 4 stars: Check-in was a huge hassle because I unwittingly used http://getaroom.com, when I thought I was calling the hotel directly.  Eventually, after waiting over 20 minutes, the people at the desk were willing to put a hold on my credit card while they waited for http://getaroom.com to get back to them about my reservation, which was already paid for.  But they could have done that from the start, rather than making me stand in the lobby for all of that time. Also, I was told internet would be free in my room.  It asked to charge me at log on, so I called to the front desk.  they told me to accept the charges, and assured me that I would not be charged.  At check-out, the charge was on my invoice.  The person at the counter printed me a new invoice, and assured me I would not be charged.  Two days later, I notice that my bank account has been charged $13 for internet usage.  I am now waiting for the hotel to refund it. In addition, very early on Sunday morning, the housekeeping attempted to open my door, because I forgot to put up a "do not disturb" sign. I thought that was rude and I am glad that I had latched the interior door lock, otherwise she would have walked right in. Also, be aware that parking is $60 per day and valet only. When I got my car, the window was rolled halfway down on the passenger side, which makes me believe it was probably left that way all night.   Overall, not the worst hotel I have stayed at, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location and price were ok, but the service really kind of sucked.;3;0;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

My fiance had just proposed and had flown me out to Chicago as his job was relocating him. We were suppose to celebrate and check out the area. When we got there, our nonsmoking King room with a view was no longer available. My fiance had called in and put in a special request and they said they would honor it. We ended up in a smoking room, and then we ended up with two full beds. Oh how romantic. Not only that, for the four days we were there, the rooms were rarely made before three pm. We have since stayed at the Westin across from the House of Blues. Those rooms were must bigger, the people were nicer, and the service excellent. The service at this Westin sucked and all the management offered us was a free meal from the room service menu. Yeah!;1;1;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

419;12/7/2010;iYfEKGY9PXsoN;-8G-4dRyQSVfCf2sUvS5Og;I would agree with Joe H. on his review. I was checked into a room where the bathroom was COVERED in mold. I stayed in the room about 2 nights and had to request a new room, they upgraded me to a different room, which had a partial view. This is also the second time that I have left something at a Westin Hotel and they have "lost" my lost item. This time I had left behind a $150 Eileen Fisher shirt. I called 2 days after I had left, when I saw I left the shirt behind, and the lost and found said they could not find it. They did not take the description of the shirt down, all he wanted to know was what floor I was on, then proceeded to inform me that there were other shirts found but none matching my description. I got VERY frustrated and explained he never TOOK a description of the shirt, so then he asked what it looked like, waited 3 minutes and said "No, no shirts like that were left behind". I called again today (2 months after the fact) and was told all clothing left behind is thrown away. I was NOT impressed with this hotel nor their service. I have always been impressed with Westin, but not this hotel. Take my advice and others...this is NOT worth the money you will be spending.;2;1;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg

All that negative energy, unfortunately, took away from the lovely gesture of the restaurant giving out Valentine roses to everyone and the smiley faces of the other waitresses and staff of this place.If only we had a normal waitress,everything would have been perfect!;1;1;0;0;Ut6mvxVP5eN-Kiu7KaLrlg
421;7/16/2012;61DE-C43HnY6ilAWwdLSjQ;U4l39LSZkYGemiB6g9qIVw;We visited Chicago for a long weekend and found this hotel online.  We liked the idea of staying in a non-chain hotel, but location and price were also important considerations for us.  When we arrived, we were greeted at the front desk by Patty who set the tone for the entire weekend.  She was friendly, professional, and helpful.  We talked with her a couple of other times during our stay to ask for directions or restaurant recommendations and her hospitality was incredible and very much appreciated.  We didn't expect that in a big hotel in such a large city.  The rest of the staff -- from the housekeepers to the doormen -- were great, too. Our room was on the 9th floor and was surprisingly spacious for an older hotel.  We're also a little snobby when it comes to beds, bedding, and bathrooms and we had no complaints at all.  We could barely hear the el trains from our room and, when we did hear them, it sounded more like white noise and didn't interfere with our sleep or relaxation.   We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Silversmith and are hoping to stay there again during our next visit!;5;1;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

This hotel is near everything - all the subway lines are within 3 blocks and Michican Ave and Millenium Park are only a few blocks away as well. I got this hotel on Hotwire (never done it before - makes me nervous not seeing the hotel first!) for about $140/night when everywhere else in the area was close to $200 plus so I was happy about that. Front desk was extremely friendly and helpful the entire time:used the Yelp check in to get a suite - having the extra room came in handy throughout the trip. The suite was ready when we checked in on the very early side of around 11AM. Loved the water infused with fresh fruit in the lobby. Gym was pretty OK - 1 elliptical, 2 treadmills, 1 stepper and a weight machine. Wish the room was bigger and they had dumbells but I have seen far worse hotel gyms. Rooms show a little wear and tear and decor is not to my taste but the bed was super comfy and the tub/shower were good so I really can't complain! The room was always spotless so that is another plus. I wouldn't hesitate to come back!;4;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ
424;5/10/2012;SAwnx1;3y7fVve3EClHn4vQgWg15g;After a horrible night at the Drake (reviewed), this place was a surprisingly pleasant treat. Unpretentious and with a great central loop location, the hotel was perfect for my needs. INCREDIBLY friendly staff, HUGE bathroom, free vouchers for drinks and breakfast, low price. Not the most updated hotel (tvs are not flat screen, wood of armoire and bed headboards look a little dated, building is sort of narrow and old) but it's not that much better at any of the other fancy shmancy hotels I've been to. We stayed on third floor and I could hear the L go by, but it wasn't loud enough that it kept me awake or woke me up. I was bummed to see the free check-in upgrade offer, but our room was perfectly fine. Definitely recommend, definitely would come here again.;5;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

Based on reviews we figured we couldn't go too wrong and were not disappointed. From the start, everyone was pleasant, helpful, quick, eager to assist. The room was clean, comfortable,  and large enough for our family of four (we had wanted two doubles but were "upgraded" to a suite with a king and pull out. This worked out but was not truly an upgrade for us. Nice touches were free wireless internet (worked fine for us all weekend), free safe, whirlpool tub, separate shower, large rooms, close walking to many sites and eateries. Noise was only a problem one night when our neighbors were closing their door (letting it slam shut) continually at 2 in the morning. Most hotels have a lack of noise proofing around the door and this was no exception. That said, it really was only a problem once and briefly. Parking is what it is for downtown Chicago - you pay for it here but the Valet staff were great and will get your car whenever you need.;4;1;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

Every point of contact with the staff was positive from the moment the door was opened for us downstairs , to the lobby with our checking in & out. The rooms were clean.  The suites are good sized.  The bathroom was awesome.  Good water pressure, nice shower, AND a tub (granted I am assuming the regular rooms only have a regular sized bathroom). We had no complaints, and this was an excellent choice for the rate.  The best part for us was that we were able to access the orange, red, and blue lines easily.  AND since we took Amtrak this time, we also were able to walk to the train station (if you have a ton of luggage, you might want to grab a cab). We will definitely stay here again.  Overall a very good experience.;4;4;2;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

However, it's easily above run-of-the-mill Hilton's and Marriot's in which I often stay). It was a combination of great price, extremely customer-focused service, nice decor, very comfortable room, etc. I chose this hotel for its proximity to a meeting I had. I read reviews in yelp, and was concerned that some guest rooms were near the subway line. I called in advance and asked for a room  far from the subway, and they assured me rooms on the other side of the hotel are quiet. When I arrived, they had put me in a king suite, at the same exceptionally low price as the regular rooms with queen-sized beds. About 30 minutes after I'd settled in, Elizabeth at the front desk called to see whether everything was to my liking. Nice touch. The women at the front desk were exceptionally courteous and customer-focused throughout my stay. Most of the bell men were also, with Louis, in particular, being wonderful (from the warm greeting at my initial arrival, to offering to wak my luggage to the subway [which was a better bet to the airport than a cab during rush hour] in quite cold temperature). The room itself was spacious, warm, comfortable. The metalwork art throughout much of the hotel (which I supposed represents silversmithery), and other artwork, were tasteful. Wifi was reliable (and also free). All in all, great value for the price. I'll look to stay agin on future trips to Chicago.;5;0;1;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

Got a really nice and well-appointed suite-type room on the 8th floor toward the center of the hotel with tall windows. Luckily, the windows were not in the front where the elevated CTA trains run. The hotel was upgrading guests to king suites, and the suite and bathroom were very spacious and tastefully decorated in a masculine classic style: 2 closets, french doors, 2 televisions, upholstered window bench, and loveseat. No noise issues, and housekeeping was also respectful of the 'do not disturb' sign. I actually used the business center computer, which was fast and seemed virus-free, and had the front desk send a fax for me without any hassle or charge. Hotel is really conveniently located 2.5 blocks from the blue line (O'Hare) and right next to other loop trains. It is also about a block from Millenium Park (one of the main reasons to stay here) and Michigan Ave shops. Fantastic location and value for the price!

439;1/3/2011;kNtDBjQoNQpJn5DKe7QrFw;dt0FNgU4Lp4z7cBydk4LNQ;Besides the wall paper and that's not really important, I can't think of anything bad to say. Staying over the New Years holiday I picked this hotel and the "L' is really about 20 feet to the left of the front door. You're only seconds from going anywhere you want in town. My room was at the front of the hotel and I didn't find the noise of the train to bother me at all. The staff was very friendly, and the room was extremely clean (I cleaned rooms in a former life so I'm picky). I plan on using this hotel again when I come back and the price was such a bargain for the room and the parking, that it makes it hard for me not to use them again. If you like older hotels with charm then I suggest this one, but if you looking for water parks with in room electronic activities then this is not your hotel.;4;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

441;1/2/2011;xs0ew5RYYx6lApbx-ZnJGg;nUBfNwkyKeewSVD9StLv6w;Stayed here for a brief Christmas get-away with my son and was very pleasantly surprised. #1 is the staff. From the doorman, to bellman, to desk clerk-- each and every one was above and beyond in courtesy and professionalism. I've stayed at many five star hotels and this staff is second to none. The hotel itself is cute on the inside. I was initially concerned because it's right on the el tracks, but once inside, didn't notice the sound unless I was specifically listening for it. The room was lovely. We had a suite with a king bedroom. The bathroom is enormous. Everything looked new and clean. (FYI, the suite has a double door between the living area and sleeping area, but the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. I think it's to help air circulation. Since my son was on the sofa bed, this was a bit of a concern, but the sound was still muted between the two areas, so you can watch tv without disturbing little ones with early bed times.) There was a mini fridge in the room. The lobby is lovely, but the bar is in the diner restaurant on the first level. I inquired and the desk clerk told me it's fine to bring cocktails from the restaurant to the lobby. I'd recommend that. The restaurant serves comfort food. Nothing outstanding. Location is excellent. Walking distance to everything. A terrific value. We'll go there again.;4;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ
442;3/19/2010;1tW7kThgHTfU3JJnFeik2g;fZGAdU9g-PdXGw5rNXsjwg;I stayed here for one night on recommendation from my manager, who knows the area well.  The location was convenient, the rooms were well kept/clean/huge/comfy/quiet....more like a suite....the bar did what it needed to do, the service was delightful:overall the experience for a business class hotel (with a bit of personality) at $125 a night, blocks from everywhere I needed to be was wonderful.  Only, bring your shampoo if you're a lady.  Beware: they only offer the shampoo/conditioner combo option which means super bad hair day for important meetings the next day. :(;4;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ
443;8/16/2011;U;Q-4-4zdmeeywwKhMw-_dxg;Stayed here one night to be close to a family event. Great location, clean, really comfortable bed, large room with little living room area. We didn't use the TVs but they do need to upgrade them. Staff was pleasant if not overly enthusiastic. Gym was adequate, although if I'd gone in during early morning hours it probably wouldn't have been, with only 2 treadmills & a handful of other machines. For a first-time visit to Chicago this hotel would be great, since it's walking distance to what you want to see and the price, at least on http://hotels.com, was very good.;4;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

445;9/6/2011;lPVW8PuHDLKjtEAEkzo7EA;JjTusdmnjHxKe-Kqwr0YGA;We very much enjoyed our stay here over the weekend.  We were put on a lower floor at our request ( we like to take the stairs ) with a very nice view of the corner of State and Washington.  The room had high ceilings, huge windows, and did not feel cramped at all.  It really is a beautifully restored building. The location cannot be beat, at least for our purposes: close to both the Blue and Red lines and a couple blocks from the Metra station and Millenium Park, it's right in the middle of everything. The staff was without exception friendly, enthusiastic and accommodating.  They have a wine hour for guests from 5-6pm which featured a selection of two wines from California and a very nice sangria the night we attended.  They also have an assortment of coffee and tea available in the lobby in the mornings.  We did not try the lobby restaurant, but observed that the bar seems to close kind of early for a hotel bar. Wireless is free if you sign up for their affinity program, which we did.  At least in our room, though the signal was plenty strong, the connection seemed very slow even for the purposes of checking e-mail. Overall, it's a comfortable, upscale place to stay in a convenient location, and I thought I got a very good value for the rate I paid.  When we are next in Chicago, we'll definitely be looking up the Hotel Burnham again.;4;4;2;1;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
446;6/25/2012;adsmNCmTjM3t-w05Mp6kvw;rnHB-YbLMkwLKFCxmyk2jA;Top notch, very fast and efficient customer service by the whole staff(except for the restaurant). By the time we put the phone down for a request there was a knock at the door accommodating our needs.  Staff was very eager to please. The room we had had maintenance problems. Shower adjuster fell off when I tried to turn it for some much needed water pressure. Phones did not work and the bathroom walls were in need of serious cleaning. Enjoyed the stay and felt that our business was appreciated.;4;1;0;1;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

450;3/28/2011;Qf4fLEuMJM-UdDdTXJbSlQ;My5dub-zdWfZclKnzIxZ-Q;I stayed here for a long weekend in May '10 last year. It is a beautiful, historic, boutique hotel and I was quite impressed when we first arrived. Another plus was the free wine in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful and comfortable) every day between 4-6pm (I think). Also I thought the nightly rates were very reasonable for the wonderful location. Unfortunately, everyone can have different experiences in the same establishment, and if we had been in another room or another floor it could have been a 5 star experience. BUT, the toilet in our room exploded and flooded the ENTIRE hotel room while we were gone (Thank God) due to a plumbing issue in their building. It was disgusting. They moved us to another room (and most of our stuff thankfully stayed dry). To apologize to us they took our home address and promised to send a lovely basket or something. NEVER CAME. Also they didn't knock off any $$ for the stay. They gave us a certificate for one free drink at their bar, but that was it. Doesn't that seem like bad service? Our stuff got wet when a toilet exploded in their hotel room! I'm going back to Chicago this weekend (and go back very frequently), and I'm not planning on staying there again, but it was a pretty hotel in a great location.;2;2;0;2;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
451;12/31/2008;06QY6tAtbQNWmsfuFPbhYg;OzdqM7BbvL27AnrTZ27g-w;It was one of my first architectural discoveries in Chicago. I fell in deep love with the wrought iron staircase, the mosaic floor and the detailed elevator doors. That was 5 years ago. I live in Chicago and so needed a good occasion to stay in one of the rooms. I got married!!! (what's this for a plan?) We had the reception at the Reliance Room and were appointed to a complimentary suite for our wedding night. I loved it. The location is just unbeatable and the views.....incredible.... We decided right there and then to spend every anniversary night in that room and I can't wait for the first one!;5;3;8;4;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
452;7/16/2007;MCU5XjqOhi-sZmA;gjhzKWsqCIrpEd9pevbKZw;The marble walls and ceiling and the ornamental metal elevator grills of the Hotel Burnham will be impressive to the architect in your life, should you choose to take him along on your stay here. He'll appreciate this adaptive reuse of a historic landmark. It's even on the National Trust's Historic Hotels of America register! And spacious rooms ensure that you won't trip over one another. I even managed to get several hours of work done at the desk during my stay, which is not usually the case at cramped in-room desks. The location is excellent. In the short time I had between my arrival and when I had to be at work I managed to visit Millennium Park, take a picture with the bean and find a dress and shoes for a wedding I had to go to that weekend. Any frequent Kimpton Hotel guest will come to know their nightly wine hour. But the Hotel Burnham doesn't just offer red and white wine, they also offer Cracker Jack! Staff here goes the extra mile - spending nearly half an hour trying to hail cabs for customers stranded in the rain, always greeting guests with genuine smiles. The Hotel Burnham would be my top choice for a stay, be it work or pleasure, in Chicago.;5;4;6;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
453;10/31/2010;Rwn6vgVGHaIXThFykUZMxQ;KM_ue1c95XeKgrd-MeGS0A;The Hotel Burnham lets you step back into a bit of 19th century old world charm while still providing some of the more modern conveniences. The restoration job Kimpton has done on Daniel Burnham's 1895 predecessor to today's skyscraper is truly wonderful. I was much happier staying at this little boutique hotel this past week on my business trip than one of the other big name neighbors. Its ideally located to all that the Loop offers. If given a choice - I'll be back here again when staying in Chicago. From the moment you walk into the dark wood reception area with its quaint little sitting area, you are greeted by smiling faces eager to make your stay a success. Like most other Kimpton properties they offer an evening wine reception and have a generous pet policy. It pays to be a member of their Kimpton In Touch program (free) as you get free internet access, $10 mini-bar credit and free continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. A couple of tips for this particular location: - You will get an actual key to your room. At first I loved concept this antiquated concept, hearkening back to a simpler time. But after a week of the key jingling in my pocket and trying not to lose the darn thing - I think I'd rather leave this part of history behind and have the added security of modern key cards. - There aren't hairdryers in the rooms (at least in mine) but they will bring one up to you. - Rooms are a little small. Try to get at least a queen or king room - at 5.4 my footsies were hanging off the double bed unless I scrunched all the way up on my pillows. Issue solved by sleeping diagonally - but the larger bed would have been nice. - Request an upper floor room. I was the 5th floor overlooking Washington and State, but I could still hear quite a bit of noise from the street and "L". Didn't keep me from sleeping well though.;4;3;3;3;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
454;9/7/2006;DiiorvBoupDpgNDskaUVBg;C6HDAhyZXkAfIQ3tCbs-Gw;Loved it! Staff was accomodating and friendly.  Hotel was a beautiful renovation of the Reliance Building--rooms on the 8th floor retain the original frosted glass office doors, replicas of the original metal grillwork in the halls and elevators. Ask for a room on a higher floor--there's some serious construction going on across the street. Also--free wine between 5 and 6--hard to argue with that.;5;5;0;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
455;4/9/2008;1Xyqdm5uHBFyoARmYQGI9w;Q7tEnPaEtZox7qetRFkmEw;I was prepared to love Burnham Hotel. Being from San Francisco I was well aware of the Kimpton boutique hotel experience but... I walked into the lobby through a rathr ghetto underwhelming awning that needed an update.  It revealed none of the glamour that envelops you when you enter the lobby. Glorious red, wood, and marble transport you to another time. I walked into my room using an old fashioned key with a pendant emblazoned with their signature Celtic armor/motif that repeats throughout the hotel...  Only to find a woman brushing her teeth in her bras!  Clearly I've been assigned the wrong room!  Ok a fluke...  Not a big deal. My new room was located on the 5th floor with a view of Washington street.  No woman in bras but I was greeted by beautiful yellow wallpaper, fancy electronics and striking blue and white room scheme. I nestled into my bed, and cozied with a beer and organic kettle chips from the honor bar. I had a all day meeting starting at 6 a very important that I get good sleep.  So far so good Except I was woken up at night constantly by the sound of construction of a new building across the street. It was a jackhammer (are jackhammers allowed at that time of day??!!)  what was more  perplexing is that a lot of rooms faced Washington. Am I the only one who couldn't sleep through the noise?   Travelers beware. I love this hotel but please ask for a room away from Washington if you want sleep!;2;3;1;1;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
456;11/27/2010;7HtzKNUWvQ;K9U2qxPFi5llft8KuZIPjg;Hotel Burnham is one of the Kimpton's more interesting hotels - maybe not as luxurious as the Palomar, but a lot more character than the Allergro.     I only stayed here one night, but the staff was very helpful and everything seemed well kept and quiet.;4;2;1;1;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
457;10/17/2007;8OR2xDoTamSOmGQR49hZLA;d89lRBtRUBqJSCttUXvQTg;Architecture defines the "boutique hotel" experience. Staff extremely friendly and accomodating.  I left some items in my room, and hotel staff went out of their way to find these items and ship them to me.  All the while, they kept me updated by phone. In-hotel dining (Atwood) is of quality. The room itself was beautiful,  corner windows overlooking the busy Chicago streetscape. This would make a great place for a couples getaway.  I would stay here again and recommend the hotel highly.;5;2;3;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
458;9/5/2006;ybSRjnNPK5Leq4CQfUB7Hw;Wyj9ZT33URUTZVP_Skia1g;I loved staying here. The beds were comfy, the staff incredibly nice and attentive, and the location? A few blocks from millenium park, kitty corner to the picasso, and less than a block from a jimmy john's. update -- I STILL loved stayed here.

459;11/10/2009;N8iTvTIRe2V8;7xiTPKDU5Xnr5iSHONgfgw;The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago. Perfect location. It's on the corner of State Street and Washington. A couple blocks one way is Millennium Park. A couple blocks the other way is the Chicago River. A short walk away from the Art Institute. A couple blocks away from Metro and bus stops. Making the entire city easily accessible. The hotel room was great. We asked from a room facing State Street when we checked in because there is some construction across Washington. We got an end room on the 12th floor. Great view down Washington toward Millennium Park and also down State Street toward the Chicago River, with a view of the Chicago Theater. The room was a modest size. The bathroom was nice. One thing that we found amusing was that the shower head was about 6-7 inches above my head, and I'm 6'3". That hardly ever happens. The fitness room was small. Not much to it. There are two treadmills, one elliptical, one bike, and a set of free weights. It was a means to get our workout done. There are water and towels provided. The hotel restaurant was one of the better reviewed restaurants in the city. Some thing we didn't expect. I was recommended to eat at the Atwood Cafe and upon looking it up, I discovered it was at our hotel. The food was very good. Reservations are recommended. You can make those easily through http://opentable.com. Overall, we had a great trip to Chicago. And we feel this was due in large part to the hotel experience. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You can't beat the location and service. And if you keep your eyes open for deals, you can stay here for a great price.;5;2;1;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

461;7/18/2011;B334Hj56GSR-8dlIB3s99w;sKVIL6VYjuAaO-hiS2rzTw;My favorite hotel in Chicago.  Why?  First and foremost, the staff is outstanding.  They are so friendly and helpful.  Reggie, the Bell Captain, has been there for years to welcome you to the hotel. Second, is location.  You can take take the blue line to/from O'hare and the hotel is a mere 2 blocks away from the station.  They are also close to 2 "L" line stations, and the red line. Third is the complimentary nightly wine reception.  This is a great way to start your evening and I always meet interesting people. Fourth is the decor and history behind this hotel.  Ask to stay on one of the historic floors (7 and above) for a truly unique experience. But again, it is the staff at this hotel which make it exceptional!;5;0;0;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
462;11/11/2007;pRwuaAO;HZ9ep6UdCW0TmTTAfjzYxg;Another one of my indulgences is brunch.  A mimosa or bellini, a divinely prepared omelette or eggs benedict...yum.   Yet, I've struggeld to find this sort of experience...until now.  This is my third visit to the Atwood Cafe for brunch and I am now convinced. This is a marvelous, little gem!  The food is wonderful, the service superb and the mimosas are appropriately tasty.  Even more importantly, unlike some of the other brunch/breakfast places, you can make a reservation, the prices are incredibly cheap and space is wonderfully decorated.  Add the cute valet (that resembles Will Smith), the waiter with the catty...yet adorable accent, and you have the perfect Sunday afternoon.;5;3;1;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
463;5/20/2011;MlJtpAJVvYaE;KkJ-kMp_S_zOU74LPtmSYA;Stayed 2 nights recently while I was in  Chicago for my job.  Located at the corner of West Washington and State, it's the perfect location for shopping, theater and sightseeing. You can reach the Burnham easily from O'Hare via subway -- stop is just around the corner. The Art Institute and the Chicago Symphony are both within walking distance.  The rooms are small, yes, but are beautifully decorated, though perhaps not to everyone's taste.  Enjoyed the free evening wine reception and the hotel bar/restaurant seemed quite popular.  Staff are extremely friendly and helpful and create an all around warm atmosphere.  I like to exercise but their tiny fitness room did not meet my needs.  No worries-- there's a Bally's on the next block up on W Washington that allows non-members to work out for $10 a day.  Perfect!;4;0;0;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

467;10/13/2010;5jfp7MHT0WcNmdCYsaeyrQ;d_Pf1KBJjt6yGrSwFpq5hA;Discovered this hotel with an online advertisement, we picked to stay at Hotel Burnham because of its convenient location and historic interest. We always liked more boutique-style establishments than their big-name counterparts. Moreover, Kimpton chain's super nice pet policy was an A-plus when we traveled with our dog. Service from front desk to housekeeping was across-the-board attentive, courteous and friendly. The architecture was unique and interior was bohemian. Only did I wish they had a glass of absinthe waiting for me at the bar but they did serve you glasses of red or white wine at the turndown hours. Although the size of the room was relatively smaller, the high ceiling compensated the area and made it feel not as claustrophobic. We loved having a descent restaurant in our hotel and the hotel's Atwood Cafe was fantastic. Food was up to par with some good restaurants. At least we kept going back for several more meals. We had no regrets staying at Burnham and for sure we would look for other Kimpton hotels in other cities too.;4;0;0;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw

470;5/11/2012;hrprCSWC4LzKAqOYqxD41w;YrW0ZwG5y_mzX2m7vDqMug;Unfortunately, perhaps the worst experience I've had at a hotel in the US (not the world). First, a few good things: -Location is superb -Can't beat the price -Desk staff was helpful and nice And now the litany of bad things: -Room smelled horrible (like sewage of sewer gases) -Made a NYC hotel room look huge. -Was not clean or cleaned very well. -Had a couple of roaches -AC didn't work in my room -Toilet wouldn't reliably flush -Shower water pressure was what I would describe as a dribble. -Room didn't have a Iron or ironing board in it (weird, but I did get one on request) -Room layout was not well done (i.e. no desk, just a bed, never seen this before) -No amenities of any kind besides really slow wifi, not even coffee and donuts in the AM. Bottom-line, you get what you pay for and this place is cheap. As others have said if you're not going to be in room and just out and about it's probably passable, but just. Incidentally, after two nights in a simply awful room I explained my plight to the manager and she promptly moved me without any fuss to a new room which was much better.;2;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
471;2/15/2012;mLCiGRVQlAiEUOpQg4ufsQ;CkLK5ykKRBCa0cgHHHEtuQ;Pros - So super cheap. Amazing location. Friendly staff. Comfortable pillows. Cons - It smells. Legit, like a strong bleach smell that makes you think people have died recently in the room. It is also dingy and claustrophobic. If you are spending no time in your room, it's perfect. If you like downtime in your hotel room, you might want to keep looking.;2;1;0;1;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
472;4/18/2012;k0;O6fv0KBZ4ejwzkXgzsgotA;This was place was alright.  I recently booked a room last minute. The rooms were somewhat small but had a safe, extra storage, and the hotel is dog friendly which is a rarity for a downtown "cheap" room. I would have given more stars if it was cleaner. The bathroom floors, walls and door were pretty ragged. Valet was $40, which I was sort of bummed about when we ended up waiting 20 mins to get our car even though we called ahead and explained we were in a hurry. $40 is standard for the location. Also there is no street parking at all. Other than that, the staff was really friendly, and the location is pretty cool. I highly reccomend this place if you are traveling with a dog and need a last minute place to chill in the city.;3;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng

Hell No. This is a very budget "motel" nicer than I was expecting, but still miles away from something I'd recommend to my picky friends.  I stay here for a number of reasons, the price is awesome.. around 56 bucks a night for a room in downtown Chicago is awesome.  The rooms are smaller, but enough for me... I don't come to Chicago to sit in my hotel room, I sleep here and that's about it. I've never had a problem with check in, the staff has also been very nice, no major issues with the room.  They are quick to address anything that is wrong, for instance during my last trip the iron had some residue from previous use..

475;3/9/2012;cPLcZC;XROL3Wp3vClB7mU2yvPAaQ;This is without a doubt the filthiest, most disgusting hotels in the world. Don't walk run from this place.;1;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
476;4/29/2008;RDEpgl4X;tFU0oWJHr1m6dPE6z_C3Vw;I'm giving Red Roof Inn 4 stars if only for the fact that I was one block away from Michigan Avenue and only had to pay $120 a night. That being said, the rooms are the sizes of small dorm rooms and how they fit 2 full sized beds and a dresser in there is beyond my mental ability. No joke, there was about a foot and a half between the foot of the bed and the wall. The bathroom wasn't much better, though it was clean and that was my only concern. I have to say that while this Red Roof Inn was run down, it wasn't dirty or grimy. The staff was non-existent. That's good if nothing goes wrong, but if you had any needs I don't know if that would be a plus. $33 a night for parking is a crime where I come from, but like I said, you're getting a steal with the price of the room.;4;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng

480;11/23/2009;o0FsUP7TXydUeRHlLL8UOA;lxMelMv7omb9V2WLBoUBdQ;We stayed here for $50 a night while in Chicago checking out apartments. It was mostly clean  except for a few hairs around the shower and sink. The wifi is T-mobile and is extremely slow. They have Lodgnet with a physical lock on the connection so you can't plug in a laptop and watch your movies from your macbook. Room was small yet cozy. Staff was friendly. Location wasn't as convenient as the Travelodge I stayed at a few years ago but still a good choice for downtown Chicago.;4;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng

482;12/22/2009;vL-BxVEILSuvgiPqO3Rpog;9pesJPCMT18mWkl48z72MQ;We used this as the cheap hotel option for our guests for our wedding. I think we had a rate of $89 a night the weekend we had it, which was great for those that didnt want to spend too much. No complaints on the rooms from anyone that I heard of. It is a little bit of an older hotel and not too many amenities, but they have updated some things and for the price it was great. One guest got turned away because he arrived late, which is something that should not happen for a group. I never followed up on it, so I'm not sure what happened exactly but thats what I heard. Either way they should have made some arrangment to get them situated. We also had some problems with guests getting rooms in our block, people saying that the block was full when it really wasn't. So it was extra work involved on our part to get that figured out, which having extra stress when planning a wedding isn't so much fun.;3;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
483;6/15/2012;xLbRYu6Qrm5Ig3vF9VXAjQ;SeILUNsDzwMnnj-jgbCOQQ;This place is a wonderful value in the middle of a city that rivals New York in cost. Amalfi is a small boutique hotel that was probably previously owned by a larger chain. I say that because there are a few features that scream "generic chain" namely the bathtub. Beautiful granite countertops greet you only to turn around and see a blah tub with a shower curtain that looks much like my Aunt Ethel's (well if I had an aunt Ethel I think it would look like that). Point being...it is a boutique hotel without 100% execution. Don't let that deter you though...there are plenty of positives. They offer an evening reception with an Italian spread. Fabulous cheeses, meats and olives line the buffet. There is an open bar with a wonderful selection. Try the Amalfitini. Even my non-girly drink consuming husband liked it. They also have a continental breakfast on each floor. I loved the fact that I didn't have to travel far to get my donuts and yogurt. The employees were hit or miss. The bell staff was incredibly friendly and helpful!!! Most of the front desk staff was very kind and outgoing. There were two women that were a bit on the snotty side but we didn't let that detract from our stay. The amenities were fabulous! Aveda bath products and they even offer body wash and not the standard bar soap cheaper hotels have gone too. I really liked that. Internet is fast and free! Parking is valet only but we were able to find self parking down the street a bit. Their valet rates however, were the cheapest I had found. Overall, this hotel was a wonderful Italian gem in the middle of the windy city. We will definitely be back! Oh,,,and if you are bringing your pooch they will welcome him (or her) with open arms!;4;4;1;1;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
484;7/8/2012;B25QIuDRNjHI6PK1mIcyog;FFs7iNr0ROqdt2PL6Yz15w;Nice hotel in a good location, very close to everything.   I liked that they provided free wi-fi and breakfast on every floor, there was a good variety of food and it was nice to not have to go far.  Staff was friendly although the lobby setup was weird, I liked that they provided free copies of Time Out Chicago, which was useful. The room was very large and spacious but Amalfi loses a star because the view out our window was just a brick wall.  Hey, at least we had privacy.;4;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

487;5/11/2012;GT3X8j1nGiCfa5LKilgw9g;lxLvaKzRcN-7gtxyywgRbA;The wife and I stayed here with another couple while we were visiting Chicago from Toronto. My friend booked this hotel from Toronto since he got a good deal per night from his work. We got there and during check in, we were told that the two rooms were not together but on different floors. My thing is, he booked this hotel a month or so in advance and asked that both rooms be together or at least on the same floor. You can call and put in REQUESTS. When he had requested it, the person on the phone checked and agreed. Yet, when we check in, we are told something different. As always, every hotel is completely booked whenever you need something regarding a room. What's new? So from the first moment, I wasn't happy. We get to the room and it's an okay size and clean. No complaints with that. The continental breakfast is a plus since it's on your floor so you can go in your pj's or whatever. All in all, I remember that this place wasn't pleasant. It's in a good location downtown close to everything you need. I remember the staff wasn't friendly or helpful. The lobby is quite small as well but then again, it's downtown so I guess the space was limited. An okay place to stay at.;3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
488;8/21/2012;WUzNWy6uSznnuny9rvG2Rw;8x0ssFtFB9XJ_ju7uEFE4w;As far as I am concerned, I do not need to ever stay in any other hotel in the Chicago area.  Chicago is a great place to visit and, at least in the summer...those cold winds blowing off the lake in winter are not fun.  But summer is great and there is always something to do.  On a recent trip we stayed for the first time at the Amalfi Hotel...and this is now my favorite hotel ever.  It is very small and the staff is just fantastic.  They were ready to help at any time.  I almost wish we had a problem while we were there so that I could have seen how they handled it...but I never got the chance since the approximately one week stay there was just perfect.  The hotel has the perfect location on the near north side and everything of interest is either a walk or a short taxi ride away.  In the evening you can enjoy free cocktails and munchies up on the 5th floor...you have got to try their Amalfitini...I just had to go back every night for more, it was so good.  I guarantee that you will love this place...and, by the way, get there in the late afternoon and try the cookies at the registration desk...but no fair eating the whole platter full!;5;1;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
489;4/25/2012;63yGhT139NTvW6IQDvzMmg;TAUwQExTxDnpPwqhouhJcA;The Amalfi Hotel is a fantastic choice when staying in Chicago.  There are a lot of options in this city, high end to more economical but what makes the Amalfi Hotel stand out are the people, convenience and little "extras" that make a hotel stay an experience.   1.  The people are beyond amazing.  So nice, helpful and always happy to see you. 2.  The rooms are well maintained, comfy, spacious 3.  LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.  This hotel is in the center of it all. Located within a few blocks of the subway, this made the hotel easy to find and easy to leave when needing to get to the airport. In the theater district with the House of Blues right around the corner and the good old land mark of the Chicago Marquee Theater.  Restaurants abound, with Keefer attached to the hotel and Public House as you walk out the door.  Round the corner and you have a true taste of Chicago with some of the best best pizza, (Rossi's pizza by the slice) Mother Hubbard's local bar and etc. 4. There is a complimentary breakfast served each morning on each floor.   5. Happy Hour, open bar (definitely try the Amalfitini) and snacks (great selection of cheese, olives, finger foods, bread, cold cuts etc) ...this place is so wonderful, why the 4 stars?   While during our stay, we noticed there is a bar/club right next to the hotel that played music until 4:30a.m and we could hear the loud people and music ONLY on Saturday night.  All other nights it was quiet. Also, we stayed on the 4th floor and had a splendid view of a brick wall. :(;4;0;0;1;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
490;4/11/2012;x24yqaMT3cGLoiAiUpDGWA;YK4EivRNkXZH8vXbI8lKDA;The Amalfi Hotel is a great choice when staying in Chicago.  Located just north of the River, you get around pretty easily either by foot, "L" train or car.  We were greeted by a very friendly staff and check-in/check-out were effortless.   The room was very nice.  There was a much in the way of space and amenities as a person could want.  The TV was fine.  The remote has a tiny delay but, that doesn't set me back.  There was plenty of space.  The bathroom was fine.  The double faucet in the shower was a personal dream come true.  We even had a pretty good view of the city from our room. Every morning, there was a generous continental breakfast that was maintained pretty diligently by the staff (who were also really nice).  Each evening there was a cocktail party in the Ravello Lounge on the top floor which is always pretty popular.  The house cocktails (the Amalfitini and the Sorrento Sunset) and pretty darn tasty!  I won't lie, it's a pretty sweet set up they've got here.   I plan on returning to the Amalfi.  I also recommend it pretty freely.  We were treated well and left making plans for our next visit.;4;0;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
491;1/16/2012;qvzMzXyJCCKtZds47V9Dtw;gzuJNs2DgG-rd6Pc_6_30A;Spent the weekend here and it was great.  Checked in at 3:00, our room was ready and after checking emails and catching up on a little bit of work, it was 5:30.  Cocktail hour (or in this case...90 minutes)  They have a room set up for free drinks and food every day at 5:30.  Good stuff.  My wife had the "Amalfitini" and I had a gin and tonic.  Beefeaters Gin, better than what I had expected.  Met a couple from Switzerland and had a great time talking over a few more drinks. We had a corner room with views of 3 different directions.  Plenty of space and in the morning, there's a continental breakfast set up on each floor.  This is great as you don't have to juggle coffee and a bagel in the elevator. Bellmen were nice and accomodating.  It's in River North and close to so many restaurants and clubs.  I highly recommend it.;5;3;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

Perfect location, especially for St. Patrick's day, and it was immaculately clean. Their staff at the front desk/concierge were knowledgeable, eager to help and SO pleasant. The room was roomy and spotless. Book the room that includes both breakfast AND the cocktail lounge (complimentary drinks) before walking to either corner of the Kinzie block for a fine dining experience or a casual fun bar!

494;9/2/2011;uk2MDDTBMs-pIyMhoivSyQ;DejbySADs66NO3RMAuzBIw;This hotel kind of reminded me of the casino hotels in Biloxi,MS to give you a reference. Some of the staff was nice and some not so much. It was weird no one offered to bring our bags to our rooms but only helped with our bags on our day of departure. I liked the complimentary lemon cookies from Maggiano's Little Italy which greeted us at the welcome desk. Although their breakfast is not as great as the ones served at Holiday Inn it was very sufficient with it's yogurt and bagels with various condiments such as cream cheese and peanut butter. The location could not be beat within walking distance of Michigan ave and Wacker Dr the dock for the Architectural Boat Tour and Xoco Rick Bayless restaurant! Next time I'm in town I definitely wanna check out the complimentary happy hour.;4;5;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
495;8/9/2011;TZyaLfuHBvRD64awo;jNukOYHycwleeNqRHTXF6g;This place had some major downfalls, with a few good qualities that I will give them full credit for. Downfalls: NOISY! I booked through a show I go to 6 times a year and it was my first time at the Amalfi.  I got a room on the alley (lovely I know), and there was constant noise ALL NIGHT LONG! Glass breaking, loud party goers, blasted trash trucks at all hours! Maybe invest in better windows Amalfi? My favorite part was on the day I checked out the maids came to all the rooms on my floor knocking at 7:30 and when I said I was still using the room she shouted through the door "When are you leaving!", um... not the friendliest service! I also had an issue with my shower and called down and asked them to service it 2 days in a row and don't think anyone ever came to fix it because it still had issues. My company had to send me a box and they charged me a $5 recieving fee?  They never even brought the box to my room, I had to go down two days in a row and ask for it. Good qualities: Nice rooms for the price, Chicago is PRICEY! Within walking distance to my destination the Merchandise Mart.  Continental breakfast on every floor was a nice touch. Never got to the happy hour because I was working but I heard great thigns about it. They have umbrella's in the room you can use or purchase if you decide to keep, this came into great use as it rained most of my trip. If I chose to stay here again I would demand a room on a different side of the building and put out the do not disturb sign on my check out day!!!;3;2;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
496;11/4/2010;bf5Fi9rTzKEFNWMOu7vfGw;Bk0DXWcVPVvy03ufWsEuHg;The amalfi hotel is great.  I've only stayed there on business so I don't usually hang out in the room all day. I do alot of traveling and have to admit, the rooms are small though so try to get a corner room, they're bigger.   The amenities in the rooms are great, love the robe and slippers!  They have THE BEST continental breakfast on every floor each morning. They also have an awesome happy hour every day with FREE top shelf alcohol along with some antipasto.  The staff who works the happy hour is great!   I literally choose to stay in this hotel when i'm in chicago just for the breakfast and happy hour, love it!   Although, Amalfi if you're reading this, what happened to the vendor you used to get the flakey, buttery chocolate croissants from??! The new ones taste like a roll or bread?  Love that you added other new stuff to the breakfast mix, but bring that old croissant back!!!! I see people complain about the food, that they don't have room service, yes I agree that it sucks to have Harry Cary's as the only option. But they make up for it with the free breakfast and happy hour,,,,,so that is totally fair.  Plus there are some really great places in Rivernorth to dine at so there are many options.....I would suggest Rockit or Havana.   THe only thing i can't give rave reviews about is the people at the front desk, never had anyone really give me great service and at times they have even ignored me while on the phone. Everyone else at the hotel makes up for them though, even the door dudes are nice. So I used to come here for years and loved looking at the photos of the amalfi coast and said "i'd love to go to the real amalfi one day"!  I got to do that this year! Stay here when you can get a good rate and if you like boutique hotels.;4;4;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
497;11/4/2009;6Btea9kGVXq6gIvAZrcCwA;EeI4yjrvQi_H_q-5CXjUfg;I stayed here in 2004 and thought it was incredible, and I was very excited to return. I was a little worried that I had overhyped it to myself, and it wouldn't quite live up to the expectations of the younger, more easily impressed me. I was wrong. The Amalfi is one of the best hotel experiences a person can possibly have (outside of the people who drop like 5k a night on rooms). Upon entering, the lobby is nice with music playing, and the checkin is very smooth. The rooms are great. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in. the mattress, sheets, pillows, everything. I can go on and on about these beds, they are that comfortable. Nice LCD TVs and they leave a few books and jazz CDs in your room which is really cool! I read they have a library of DVDs and CDs if you want. I didnt check out the minibar but from my last experience i think i really liked it. There's not much of a view, but who cares. Nice robe and slippers in the rooms also. The hotel as a gym which is basically a few treadmills, but it helps. USA today at your door every morning. Each floor has a breakfast station which is really cool. Juices, bagels, pastries, etc. The hotel as a complimentary happy hour also, from 530-7 with free alcohol (tip the bartender because they are very nice and hook you up) and some food. cheeses, foccaccia, salami, brushetta, etc. The $ for the hotel is very good for where it is. In the area, there are plenty of bars, grills, restaurants etc. For business travelers, its about a $7 cab ride to the sears tower. The hotel is perfect for business or for traveling to visit chicago with a spouse. I will definitely be returning here!;5;10;4;4;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
498;6/2/2008;jPbLWE7J9QysQsFMqQuqpA;6wXJ1iHBk38FS_Vqu2qzQg;Note to self: When planning a last minute trip to Chicago, don't choose a weekend when 60,000 doctors are in town for a medical convention. For a quick family trip (my mom, dad and brother), we decided to head to Chicago to visit old friends. Unfortunately, because of the convention, every last hotel room in the city was booked. Finally, we were able to find one last room at the Amalfi Hotel. As a 20 something, the prospect of sharing one hotel room with my parents and my younger brother was frightening. Fortunately, the Amalfi made it an amazing experience. The room was spacious enough with it's 2 queen sized beds and large bathroom to accomodate us and our stuff. Upon check in the concierge remembered my mother from their phone conversation a few days prior and was so sweet, friendly and helpful. She gave us great recommendations for places to go for dinner and drinks which really made the trip all the more worthwhile. One of the best perks is the free happy hour from 5:30-7pm every night. They served tons of antipasti appetizers - cheeses, breads, olives, bruschetta, etc. They also had a bartender making any drink you wished. The complimentary breakfast was great too! They had one on every floor and served standard croissants, bagels, yogurt etc. The gym was also great - plenty of cardio equipment, free weights, and fun movies playing on the tv to keep you entertained. The location was great too, which a few bars and restaurants within a few blocks and the Magnificent Mile a few blocks more. This hotel had everything you needed and wanted for a place to stay in Chicago and great staff and amenities to make the trip even more pleasant. It's more of a boutique-y hotel then say, a giant Hyatt, but for me, that was exactly what I wanted. Thank you medical convention for forcing me to stay at what is now one my favorite hotels!;5;2;2;1;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
499;8/7/2009;xP8OwTMCJkVzNfZVIiobWg;zFQnGH2aXZkP3gK7OIgcig;We ended up in one of their modern themed rooms - and boy was it eclectic, and TOTALLY up my alley. It was on one of the higher floors, so the floor-to-ceiling view was an unexpected bonus - especially since we booked our summer Saturday night here on chance, not reading any reviews beforehand. I'm not sure if all the rooms were like the one we got, or if we just lucked out completely, but WOW. Modern yet comfortable furnishings. Large and spacious bathroom with colorful polka dots EVERYWHERE. And even though the room itself left little space to run around and do cartwheels, we were pleasantly happy with our stay. We got a good deal (price divided by 2), and it was a pedestrian friendly commute to and from the bar/club scene. Highly recommend this place as an alternative to the chain hotels/motels for an authentic and one-of-a-kind experience in the heart of Chi-town. Request one of the 'modern rooms' to be amazed at how a fun duvet cover can change your hotel experience!;5;2;1;1;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

502;2/6/2012;lBz7;3K4BzZIo3bKoRrc50sX8Vw;This place is cute, but some minor inconveniences made my stay less enjoyable and I won't go back. 1. No blackout curtains in the room.  Just a sheer curtain and those fake side panels that you can't pull closed. Nothing to block out the street lamp outside the window. 2. We were the lucky guests who didn't have a do not disturb sign, which we didn't realize until the maid was banging (literally, banging) on the door at 8am. 3. People were screaming in the hallway at 3am. Not the hotel's fault, but knowing that they attract that certain demographic makes me not want to stay there again.;3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

The hotel is surrounded by brick buildings and you're more likely to be staring into an alley instead of the skyline.;4;1;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
505;11/3/2010;j0KFC8gar5Ya1Auitly3Bg;T4bQI1IxhJtpVCaZqNX2Eg;I prefer boutique hotels above chain hotels, and at the price point, the Amalfi is a fantastic value. The interior is trendy, but not obnoxious, the rooms are well appointed and sizable for a downtown hotel. The bathrooms are fabulous!   My complaints about the hotel are pretty minor. They have teeny little closets and itsy bitsy drawer space. I hate not being able to unpack. And I never realized how important room service was until I had to wander the halls looking for coffee. Seriously, providing me with coffee in the morning is in everyone's best interest.  Don't make me get dressed and talk to random strangers in order to get coffee.) Those quibbles aside, the staff was magnificent, the room was nice, and the price point was more than reasonable for a hotel with such a great location. If someone would bring me coffee and a muffin in the morning, I would be a regular visitor.;4;2;0;2;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
506;10/8/2007;MgsTor8gypobb-siVXpTww;umSFWKHrYJCnmSzzazAbGQ;I've stayed at The Amalfi many times since it first opened. The main reason is that it is centrally located right in the heart of downtown:3 blocks from The Merchandise Mart where I usually work and only slightly further from all the fabulous shopping on Michigan Avenue. Conveniently located right across the street from Harry Carreys and right next door to Keefers...both great choices for food and drink. My only problem is that the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade...it literally hasn't changed since I first stayed here 5 days ago. Still, the best value for any hotel in this location!;4;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
507;9/9/2008;Yay3nqdYrRJDEwwFE60S;hpCS4g352-ozy98wTcU4oQ;It's weird staying at a hotel in a city you live or used to live in.  "Am I now one of those tourists who would annoy the hell out of me as I went about my daily life?" you think to yourself.  Actually, it's kind of cool being a tourist in your own hometown.  It gives you a fresh perspective, as I learned while staying at the Amalfi: 1. There are no patches of grass in River North (only noticeable if you have to walk a dog). 2. There are a lot of hotels in River North (why didn't I notice this when I lived in Chicago?). 3. Despite the fact that it's a tourist trap, the nearby House of Blues hosts some great acts (blues and non-blues). 4. The Chicago River (and the buildings along it) at night is still a damn gorgeous sight to behold. 5. It's fun to be a tourist in a city you know how to get around. Staying at the Amalfi was also a fresh experience, as I had never been at a "boutique hotel" before: 1. It has a mod lobby in orange and turquoise.  No floral upholstery here! 2. Hotel staff wear clothing that matches the hotel decor (I'm serious!). 3. Free FRESH breakfast is provided.  I could have stashed a couple of those chocolate croissants and slices of cinnamon bread in my bag. 4. Cleaning staff are friendly.  Actually, this is not a good thing because I hate having someone clean up after me.  So I always clean up before the cleaning staff clean.  No, it does not make sense. 5. No extra fee is charged for having a pet. 6. Free cocktails and appetizers are provided in the evenings.  I'm still dreaming about the skinny breadsticks with sundried tomato and black bean and corn dips. 7. Cost was reasonable.  I always compare to the Federal government per diem rates for lodging, which tend to be on the low side, and the special rates at Amalfi were actually lower.;4;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
508;10/8/2010;E9Qs2Nrmfd13T8mi0BHFzw;o66jA1NPzLBWDl5ELYI1pA;I stayed at the Amalfi when I was in Chicago for a conference and thought it was a lovely hotel. The staff was all very friendly. The rooms were clean and cozy. There was a continental breakfast set up on a credenza near the elevators on each floor in the morning which was awesome. I went out in my PJs and brought breakfast back to my room. There was also a free happy hour that they hold each day for guests that included picky foods like cheese, crackers, meats, hummus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.;5;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

510;4/28/2011;CzUBmT0OTr-nZBbFqiOB5g;JkTtsONJBP08GbpA23FFtw;Our stay at the Amalfi was fabulous in nearly every possible way!   -The location is terrific-River North but very close to the loop.  There are several close L stops.  Use Clark/Lake if you're arriving via CTA from the airport.  It's almost as close as State/Lake but Clark has escalators and is a larger, easier to navigate station when you're dragging luggage.  The walk to the hotel is pleasant and short. -We spent little time in the lobby but did like the deskside check in.  It's a lot more personal and relaxing than the typical "wait in line to stand at the counter for 10 minutes" check-in. -Our room was great!  We had an extremely comfortable king bed. The bed linens were soft and cozy.  There were plenty of pillows and the padded headboard was comfortable to prop against for reading or tv watching.  The bathroom was large and clean.  The Aveda toiletries were really nice.  The bathroom had a large counter, lots of floor area, and a lighted make up mirror.  The tub was a standard tub but had a double shower head and a curved shower curtain rod to help with that "closed in" feeling.  My only complaint about the bathroom was that the towels were a bit on the rough/scratchy side rather than fluffy and soft. -We were on the 4th floor overlooking Harry Carray's restaurant.  There was some noise bleeding in from outside but it was street and traffic noise, not bar goers or pedestrians.  IMO, it was similar to the noise level in any downtown hotel when you're only a few floors above street level.  We had a view of the Trump and the Marina Towers.  Not like having a spectaular skyline view but it certainly wasn't a bad view. -We loved the complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast was a couple of steps up from a typical continental breakfast.  There were a variety of pastries, bagels, doughnuts, cereal, yogurt, and fresh whole fruit.  Milk, apple juice, and orange juice were available as well as tea and coffee.  The coffee was really quite good and it was great to be able to get refills so easily. -We also really enjoyed the free drinks and appetizers each evening at the cocktail reception.  They have a nice selection of premium liquor, two white wines, two reds, two beers, and two pre-mixed specialty cocktails.  It's a small bar so they don't have every possible option but the selection is adequate.  And c'mon-it's FREE.  The food is good if largely unchanging.  Each night there was a selection of Italian cold meats, breads, cheese, and other antipasto standards-olives, artichoke hearts, peppers, etc.  One night they had Caprese salad and it was delicious.  The lounge is rather small.  If the hotel is crowded, I doubt everyone would have a seat.  We were there at an uncrowded time and one night it was still very hard to find a seat. -The business center was well-appointed with several computers (both Macs and Dells) and a quality, fast printer.  It made printing our boarding passes easier than just about anywhere I've ever stayed. -The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  When we had spotty wireless reception (which is included, by the way), they were very responsive and sent an "engineer" up right away to investigate the issue. -Our only real complaint was with the televisions in the rooms.  We had cold, wet weather and spent our evenings mostly relaxing in our room.  The (smallish) flat screen tvs were a disappointment.  There were no HD channels, multiple pay or "hotel" channels, and the reception was spotty.  Also, the remote was awful and it was excruciatingly slow changing channels or even turning up the volume!  There was a dvd player with a (small, quite limited) selection of dvds to "check out" in the lobby-nice touch but it wouldn't hurt to update and enlarge the library. Overall we had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Amalfi and will recommend it to friends and family.  I hope we'll be able to return sometime soon!;5;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
511;12/29/2008;OGTLTtalwZACHQzzJbGL7w;FBPknO3DqSc5T4ypf2AHhw;Similar to many of the other reviews, the Amalfi has many strong points and a few drawbacks.  The room was comfortable enough and I liked the fresh colors and contemporary feel.  The jazz and soul music collections are a nice touch.  I really enjoyed the cocktail reception with the appetizers and signature drink, the Amalfitini.  The continental breakfast served on each floor was also well done.  Finally, the location is central to many of the popular downtown destinations. I'd have given the Amalfi 4 stars if not for a couple problems.  First the room, while appealing in decor, looked a little like it had been done on the cheap.  Some of the furnishings looked good but didn't have the level of quality as comparable hotels.  Plus, the carpet was really dirty in spots.  Since the place is really new, I suspect it's going to look worn before long.  There is no view as others pointed out, and the street noise can be troubling.  Finally, we had a billing issue where the rate didn't match what we'd booked on the internet.  We got it worked out but it punctuated a decent but not great stay. The overall value can be really good if you get a favorable rate.  If not, and you want an interesting newer place to stay in the same neighborhood, try the Hotel Sax.;3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
512;3/30/2011;hUoc;peVjUm6PnufDzI44vGU0Wg;Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in "lounge" is right idea with wrong execution:tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it:there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.;2;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
513;10/11/2006;xca65yeyoTIS8xzV1ShqiA;vec4p1BHgEQVpxoE-70G8Q;I agree, five stars. The staff was very friendly, professional and quick. They had the perfect recommendations for sightseeing, dining and drinking. Hangover cure breakfast @ 1 pm - the Temple Cafe was the right suggestion. The room was modern and sleek, with the most comfortable bed out of any hotel I have stayed at (and I travel for work plenty). Continental breakfast on every floor - thus allowing the guests to sneak out in pjamas, grab delicious fluffy croissants, and run away back to the room. The location was perfect - minutes from the CTA, right next to the river, and walking distance to many sights, Mag Mile, dinning and boozing. Yay Amalfi...thanks for the wonderful time.;5;2;0;1;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
514;8/28/2009;5P7mag;T2o0YCTYajodiK8uE4whiw;This was the spot i went to religiously. Stayed a couple nights every month for over a year until I decided to branch out and hit some other properties. Great location just north of the river. Walking distance to all manner of activities. Nice lobby , always a friendly staff from the doorman to the guy that works the happy hour.Rooms are standard size and beds are comfy. Get a corner room if you can its got a different layout and seems to be quieter than a regular room. Corner suite was rocken like dokken. This place also has a free happy hour from 5:30 to 7 every nite except i think Sunday. Nothing brings people out like free food and booze. Get there early and watch people descend like locusts. I once saw someone have their wedding reception at the free happy hour. Crazy! No restaurant on site but Keefer's and Harry Carey's , great steakhouse-see my review on that , are down the block. Dozens of restaurants within a couple blocks too. No pool either but that doesn't bother me Its a sweet hotel and I recomend it to anyone going to Chicago;5;3;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

516;3/10/2008;eQVh;0N2tj6-YA343DQzvpEVfgg;Our experience was all around great.  We loved the location which is close to the river, and we were able to walk everywhere downtown or hop on a bus or train quickly.  The staff was really friendly and I usually won't even look at free "continental" breakfast, but theirs was really nice.  They even refreshed it numerous times so it wasn't like if the family with ten kids shows up right before you, you are screwed.  I loved the decor of the rooms and was inspired by their color choices in the bathroom.  I would definitely stay there again.;5;1;1;1;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

518;8/18/2010;XgyHGXyQA7x5254EajKC;qNfShSoyKaznqWNL606wWQ;I stayed in this hotel the first time I came to Chicago for a college visit. It is precisely why I am moving to Chicago in a few days. When we first arrived there, the doorman greeted us and took our bags (surprisingly, thats not done much in DC) and guided us to the front desk. All of the staff we spoke to were very polite and helpful. They gave us great recommendations on where to go to for food, and advised us on how to travel when we return to the city. The hotel was quite beautiful, and very comfortable. Our rooms were a few doors down from the free happy hour and breakfast sites so my parents were pretty satisfied. The only reason I give it four stars is because the view kind of blows, but that is no reason to totally down this hotel.;4;1;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
519;4/23/2010;689OFl4XQotcT--qBvIkMQ;yABu0siSGhme2JpUA1x0PQ;My Boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights and our total bill was about $250. Not bad at all! Our room was great, I mean it's no Ritz-Carlton, but it was perfect for it's price. Everything was clean and orderly and I wasn't grossed out at all. Although we were only there for 2 days, we went to their gym so we didn't feel too guilty about all the Chicago-style pizza we just scarfed down our throats and it wasn't too shabby. We never ate the complimentary breakfast, but we did see it and it look delicious, and what is there to complain about if it's free! On the last day we had to check out at noon, but our flight didn't leave until about 7pm and we still wanted to walk around so we asked the front desk if they could hold it for us and they were pretty nice about it. My only complaint is that a couple of the front desk guys were pretty snooty/douchy, but the all the girls at the front desk and the bellhops were really friendly. This place is perfectly located too. If I ever go back to Chicago, I will definitely be staying here again!;4;3;0;3;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

First, the good: The location is great and the River North area is blowing up so there are good bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was really comfy. The breakfast bar was nice. Quiet room. Now the bad: I expected the rooms to be nicer, but they had a spiced up Holiday Inn quality and came across as a bit dingy. The view was awful. The happy hour is nice, but way too crowded and not really worth it unless you're a huge cheapskate (not judging). But all in all, a nice place, especially if you can find a good deal online.;3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
523;7/19/2011;30CluLDrHPi12rhWTGpNvw;auINkgIPRPkzGVg5Vwu3AA;The rooms are nice.  I want a corner room some time when we stay there again.  Walking distance (meaning within a mile) of so much!  We walked to Navy Pier and the Magnificent mile and even home from Soldier Field but that was more like 2.5 miles.  If you stay here go to the Purple Pig which is 0.4 miles from the hotel.  Get the Eggplant and Goat Cheese Spread.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  They have continental breakfast set up on every floor with is such a brilliant idea and really was a great touch.  Sadly, the pastries are not good.  It is a real shame because there are so many great options in Chicago which I am sure wouldn't be that much more expensive and would leave more of an impression.   The gym has nice sturdy machines which we didn't use because that is not how we vacation.  The bed was wonderful.  We will be staying here again.  $44 a day for valet is a huge negative but we didn't see where it was any cheaper anywhere else in that area.  If somebody knows of a better option/place to leave a car we won't be using all week please send me a message and let me know.  Don't want to pay that bill again.  They did do it fairly though and charged by 24 hours instead of calendar day which we really appreciated.;4;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
524;10/15/2007;gUaPS2m9YaJXhpQTAWtS;QPt4akv7JL2T_O4TNtYs-g;I stayed at the Amalfi while in town on business with a little weekend of pleasure.   Cute Boutique Hotel Location:  Great location near the River and 3 blocks from Michigan behind the new Trump Tower.  I walked everywhere from up and down Michigan toward the Loop and Mill. Park.   Check In:  I flew in early on Sat morning and my mother flew in that morning too, as we were coming from different cities.  She arrived at the hotel about 9am.  I really didn't expect to check in but at least hold our bags there and give us a place to meet up.  Mother called me and said the lady at the desk said she could check in if her name was on the reservation.  I called when I landed and spoke to the front desk and gave them the OK to let mom check in.  VERY NICE of them to let us check in at 9am!! I arrived and preceded up to the room.   Room:  The original Room they let my mother check into was not the Corner King we had booked.  It was fine, and very nice of them to let us check in that early, but I had paid more for the upgrade. So I went down to the desk and asked the lady if there was a corner king available?  If not, not a big deal as long as she could credit me the difference in price for the room. They ended up giving us a Corner King that was nice.  It was not available until later so they let us keep our stuff in the other room, while we went out for the day, and then upgraded us when we returned from shopping. The Corner King was nice.  Extremely comfortable beds, the windows around the whole room were nice, but a lot to close up at night.  Nice views, much better than the original room where we looked into another building.  I will say other than the corridor where you walked into the room, space wise it wasn't that much different than the original room.  Not really worth the upgrade unless you want the better view and all the natural light. Breakfast and the Happy hour was a great touch.  Fruit and bagels for breakfast with your choices of juices, coffee, and tea.  nothing special but perfect for us. The Free Happy Hour was very nice - they had Sky and Belvedere Vodka, Jim Beam, Captain Morgan, and others.  White and Red wines and a couple Italian beer selections.  Nice little apps too.  anti-pasta setup, cheeses, and breads. Service - lightbulb was out in the room and I called and someone came up in 5 minutes and replaced it. We did receive turndown service the 2nd night and they left a chocolate on the pillow, very nice. Lobby isn't anything much, but why do you need it to be..... Bellmen were very helpful in directions to a drug store and transportation. I typically stay at the Wyndham in Chicago but I think I will be changing to the Amalfi now.;4;3;1;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

526;8/24/2010;DJOp;tDWr9QfVH1-phUEjCGYglA;This place is located in a great area. It was easy to hang out at some of the new places like Trump Tower & Hilton Rooftop among other places. I stayed here based on a group rate for a wedding. The things I enjoyed were the free happy hour from 5:30-7 daily. The staff is extremely friendly. The rooms were very clean except for a couple noticeable stains on the chair which were gross and moving the trash again back near my clothes when I kept moving it away. The things I did not like were thin walls, slamming and kicking of doors early in the morning for the complimentary breakfast rush. It felt like it was never ending. The only relaxing time was after everyone went on with their day. Definitely not a place to go when you are jet lagged and can't handle the time difference. Beside the problems with the doors, I had a problem with my shower knob. It would slide from cool to extremely burning hot. I told the front desk but the problem was never solved and I stayed for 5 nights. I don't know if I would go back. I even asked specifically for a quiet room. When asking for a late check out, they do charge an additional fee.;3;1;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

I would ding this hotel for not restocking shower gel - we've stayed here for 4 nights and only do I get extra shower gel on the 3rd day when we ran out  and bumped into our housekeeper that morning.   For a Fairmont, I was surprised they didn't replenish.  I understand being "green" and good for the environment but we paid to stay and should have essentials restocked. Hotel is definitely in a nice location and close to the Navy Pier,  Millenium Park, riverboat cruises, and Wildberry Pancake House (a great place to get breakfast).  Overall the hotel looks and feels nice.  Noise level minimal since we were on the 18th floor.  Our car was brought up promptly so service was great there. With kids, a pool is necessary and this hotel does not offer it but we were able to get access through long corridors to the Swiss Hotel's indoor "in the sky" pool.  Just speak to the Fairmont concierge.  From this pool location, you could get a closer view of the Navy Pier.;4;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
535;8/20/2012;Ww3K96e46uAkOkJ2MZ2dXg;SJvCPlJ5X6Jkbc0TggIiCg;I stayed here for 5 nights last week for a conference and it was quite an enjoyable experience! The rooms are spacious, clean and tastefully designed. I loved the huge bathroom with both a shower and a tub. The food from room service was surprisingly excellent! I had the hummus plate one night and the lobster roll on another night. The conference rooms were also spacious and well equipped. The hotel catered our breakfast and lunch everyday and it was some of the best conference food I have had. There was a lot of variety for each meal, and there was dessert with lunch everyday! My one and only complaint is that my room was never restocked with the essentials. I had to call to have more coffee brought up. Also, the cups I used disappeared but new ones were not put in there place. A minor nuisance in the grand scheme of things, but it is those small details that make all the difference! Otherwise, I would LOVE to stay here again for business or for pleasure.;4;1;1;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
536;8/8/2012;uQCFoFxZNQLneZBo37vRCQ;vazTanfeJwjbokWZrGpNzg;Loved the Fairmont - it was old time elegant and the staff so helpful. We had a corner suite and the room next door that could close off from the rest of the hallway and let the kids roam. Lake and Navy Pier view. So nice. The lobby is beautiful - round with a wine, cheese chocolate bar in the middle (three of my favorite things) In the morning it was a coffee, juice, pastry stop. How cool is that? And the restaurant? Check this out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…  Normally I wouldn't seperate a restaurant from it's hotel with different reviewsbut this isn't "ordinary" Service was prompt every morning  (sometimes too prompt) Beds were comfy, turn down service with water left at every bed, nice bath products. Location is great - between Michican Avenue and Navy Pier, allowing us to keep the van in the garage with one exception. Be warned - Parking is expensive here. EXPENSIVE. (I think it was $60 a day) We spotted a small park from our window...perfect for the kids to play while we sat and watched. Waterspout fountains for them to run in. We were the only tourists...others were residents from nearby condos. It was a great find. Why only 4 stars? Besides the cost of parking after you're already forking it over for rooms, on arrival we pulled up at the lower level and asked if that was OK. They told us it was better because the front entrance is undergoing renovation. Then we waited in the heat with 5 kids for 25 minutes for a bellman. Not a good first impression. Also...no pool although they can send you to a nearby hotel's pool. Two hotel lobbies in my swimsuit...I don't think so. And you had to go thru a tunnel at the front entrance due to construction. Creepy. Construction won't last much longer, and I would definitely stay here again! Two thumbs up.;4;7;8;6;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

I have to thank my job for sending me to Chicago this past May for an employee recognition trip. This was a great experience and i really happy i was able to share it with Meesh. We got there a day early to get the exploring started early. The Fairmont from day 1 impressed me. The service was top notch and the staff always had a smile on their faces. Always eager to help and make our stay more enjoyable. I felt like a little kid as we walked in the room. The bed was humungous and comfy as hell. Beautiful bathrooms and a sweet view plus they put us on the 20th floor so we could take advantage the view. We were there for a few days and soaked up the hotel and the city. Its located right in the middle by Millennium Park and everything is but a short cab ride away. Quick tip - walk around the block and check the Noodle place. Freaking delicious. We found it the last day there. Epic fail. if not, we would have been noodled out. Will i stay here again. If the price is right then yes. It can get a bit pricey but since my job was paying i was not worrying about the bill. Where to next ? travel buddy/girlfriend/adventurer Meesh Adventure is out there!;4;4;2;2;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
539;12/3/2011;so638g96Vj8KDMtpl7FKSw;hRthv8jRokuGuyZdmrkcDg;Overpriced, poor service. Generally when I go to a place that costs around $400 a night I expect to be treated well and it to be a memorable experience. When I got there the king size bed I reserved was not available so my girlfriend and I had to spend the weekend sharing a double. The concierge had attitude and offered nothing for our inconvenience. We go into the restaurant to get more attitude from the waitress, who forgot out drinks and made us feel unwelcome. I travel a lot, and often get better service in more stylish rooms for half the cost. I'll never stay in a fairmont again, I suggest anyone who has a choice do the same.;1;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
540;9/22/2011;gPNHSUZI5zQtFHSdoJi;LoX4R1iNTJTHn-unk_Y4iQ;We stayed at Fairmont for 10 days due to a conference that was being held within the hotel. We checked in around 8pm the first night after a long delay of flight, but instead of checking in the room that we booked 6 months ago, we had to wait in the lobby for 30 mins for the room to be cleaned. The room was small and out-dated. We also had a small coffee table that's totally broken. The bathroom did not have the usual toiletries that you see at other 4-5 star hotels, q-tips/cotton balls etc, and the shower area had a strong moldy smell. The only good thing about it was that they had Miller Harris toiletries (which was not that great either.) No in-room coffee and no starbucks in the hotel. I had to walk to N Michigan Ave. for a cup of latte every morning. The location is great ONLY if you have a meeting right in the hotel, otherwise the area is very 9-5 and deserted after business hours. It's a long walk to any other tourist attractions or decent restaurants. I'd have chosen InterContinental if I've known the area better.;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

542;3/20/2012;55v;gEl5iw1u54AFKEkA15JCLA;Great stay!! Me and my girls went to Chicago for the weekend, had a great stay at the Fairmont, it was affordable (on Orbitz), super friendly staff and the views were awesome. The prices were ridiculous though. 2 mimosas (not hard alcohol) were $35. Not gonna do that again!! But everything was great :);4;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
543;4/19/2011;ZFGeCtKZlcLgZw-NfiTxag;ZD8qV-dB8wr0Wxizh-LH0w;This is a really nice hotel.. I don't have too much experience with straight up $$$$ hotels as I usually prefer just a place where I can sleep, change, and clean myself up. This was a sweet holiday gift from my bf's parents as it also allowed us to sleep in Chicago for two nights before heading out to Wisconsin for Christmas. The location of the Fairmont is very nice - just a short 20 minute walk out and you can get around to Navy Pier and lots of other cool locations. Walk out further 20-30 minutes and you can get your way to a sweet bar selling sweet microbrews. Yum. The rooms are really nice especially for a double bed. I can't imagine a room with larger beds or one singular king-sized bed, but I would think that it would be pretty nice! They have lots of dresser space to put your clothes in, really nice pillows and blankets, the beds definitely let your legs dangle in a child-like fashion if you wanted to, the windows don't open up a lot but they do for some air, the heater/ac works accordingly, and the bathroom.. YAY. I love clean bathrooms. And awesome baths. Really nice standing up showers. A little hide-a-seek toilet room. I also frequented the spa downstairs in the basement as well - it's really nice and it was empty, so I could walk around completely naked as I had wished. And I did.;4;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
544;5/14/2007;Z5GRf0HMV3B4LBFWziZajw;w57Yn8npGhdDHmHFGKk2jA;I came here for a wedding reception and the hotel did a great job.  They had a room off of the main ballroom for a reception for the guest until the wedding party arrived, then we moved in the ballroom which was very elegant. The staff was great the food was decent.  I would highly recommend this place for a wedding and/or wedding reception.;5;3;1;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
545;2/2/2011;Ailwd-1hcqq;P1ttJQl6pdfSGUa9V4o-6g;I am sad to give this hotel only 2 stars because I was looking forward to staying here.  It was a complete disappointment. We stayed for the 2010 Chicago Marathon.  If running the marathon, do not make the Fairmont your first choice, regardless of how close it is to the starting/finish line & runner reunite stations. So many things went wrong with our visit and I would be reluctant to book with them again for the 2011 marathon. When we checked in, we were given a smoking room despite requesting a non-smoking room. The room reeked of smoke...as if someone just had a cigarette in the room right before we entered.  I was with my husband and children (3-years and a 15-months), and it was completely unacceptable to have them breathing this polluted air.  And I would be running 26.2 miles...it was beyond upsetting that I'd be breathing this air the night before the big run.  The one bed also seemed a bit 'off' like it was hastily made. We called the front desk to explain the situation and were told the hotel was fully booked and the best they could do was have maintenance clean the room again.  They could not commit to a time though, told us to go out for a few hours, and hopefully it would be in better shape when we got back.  Staff was not terribly rude, but they were certainly less than helpful or sympathetic to our issues. We proceeded to look for other accommodations rather than stay here.  While we were looking for hotels, my kids knocked over the wastebasket.  Lo and behold, they found a box of cigarettes, a bottle of beer, and a used condom (not in its wrapper) and the torn condom wrapper.  Thankfully the condom was stuck to the bottom of the wastebasket, so my kids didn't touch it.  We immediately called the Front Desk, let them know what we discovered, and within 5 minutes, they called us back and moved us to a nicer, non-smoking room. Obviously, the room was not cleaned before we arrived (or at least cleaned properly), and I assume someone may have even been in there moments before we arrived which could explain the strong cigarette smell that we encountered and mussed up bed. Again, I'm extremely disappointed to have to write a terrible review, because the Fairmont is in a wonderful location and seems to be as classy as the other reviewers note.  We often use the Fairmont in my company as well, and I've heard good things about them.  But obviously our experience does not say much for their cleanliness. I do give it two stars because I appreciate the staff getting us into another room quickly, though, I wish we didn't have to come across a used room and condom to get there.  Oh, and in-room dining was good, including the big bowl of pasta I had to prepare me for the marathon.;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
546;8/16/2008;OjjlNfRoZmHotRwzIdd7PA;tXKTfiUh_3R1En0xYonXdw;View from my room on the 31st floor: most of Chicago, plus Lake Michigan.  Hey, I could get used to this.  Too bad I was in the hotel room, and awake, for maybe 3 hours total.  Wait, actually, that's a good thing, but for other reasons. Huge room, separate shower and bath (and makeup vanity, but I didn't use that), nice LG flatscreen wall-mounted, very decent bed. Downsides: bad pillows (I HATE soft and squishy pillows):shower had one of those ceiling-mounted rainfall shower heads, which look awesome but don't function that well:there was a black extension cord just running along the floor to power a lamp.  None of these are big things, but they are enough to warrant 4 stars instead of 5.;4;1;3;1;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
547;4/12/2011;MQOsjE9ebBlt7E2Zry4kOw;6k1rdZeEwztIDS84KcEA1g;Just spent a few days here at a work conference.  I have traveled A LOT for work and have spent plenty of nights in some pretty bad places and some pretty good ones.  Although as far as you know I am making that up.  I am not.  I disgress. Stayed two nights here this past week and was very impressed with everything about the hotel.  Not only is the staff very friendly but they addressed any issues that came up with my stay immediately.  Since I am sure you are curious the two issues were (1) my keys didn't work one night when I came back to the room (they ran two new keys up to my floor while I waited) and (2) I needed something out of my car which I had valet parked.  They also brought it up to my room within 10-15 minutes of my request.  Very impressed. Rooms were clean, modern and very spacious.  Excellent views of the city (from the 23rd floor).  The hotel has a nice spa in the lower level of the hotel.  In addition the hotel is connected to Chicgao's "pedway" which is an underground tunnel system connecting man of the buildings to one another.  Thus, I was able to get Starbucks in the morning without having to go outside. The only downside to this hotel was the conference rooms.  As I mentioned I was here for a work conference.  The rooms were cold as hell.  Hmmm...not such a great analogy come to think of it.  Needless to say many people were wearing jackets etc during the conference to stay warm.  It was ridiculous especially since it is April and wasn't warm outside. The only other caution I have for you dear reader is that valet parking is $51/night which even for Chicago seems steep.  I would recommend not parking here if you can find an overnight ramp cheaper.;4;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
548;1/9/2011;L6YX6a7NHNdYRscmMT7h8w;GmpSEv4b0AoIFATqNBu1bQ;This Fairmont certainly one-ups it here. Large clean rooms with actually tasteful decor. Marbled bathrooms with a huge shower n' bath. Plush robes. Miller Harris toiletries. NY times paper at your door. Free hotel valet during our stay and the most random phone near your toilet should need room service from there? Our package also included a $100 Saks card which was pure heaven for me aside from the fantastic hotel services. The valet service can be hit or miss some nights - having to track someone down can be a pill. The other amenities include (but we didn't use) a great spa that was open almost 24 hours daily. Pool n' work out room for $10 bucks all day pass. The hotel is also a little ways away from the shopping, so if you plan to hit the Mile then be prepared to do some walking. Overall no complaints, fantastic hotel and would stay again and again.;5;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
549;1/22/2008;IcotLaBmAx5YplcDC2Pp5w;rTNCkF0gZrIdf-6YvVdY6Q;It was a nice hotel, great location, great gym that was connected and everyone there was very accommodating.  I can't say much for the rooms though.  The rooms weren't too big, it smelled, the beds seemed smaller than a full but bigger than a twin and the bathrooms in the lobby were better looking.   And it was weird how we had to take an escalator down a floor to take an elevator up to our rooms.  And the carts that held all the towels, toilet paper and everything else they used to clean each room stayed parked outside our room all weekend.  I mean it was convenient when we needed towels and all but just an eyesore.   The location is great though, there's a gym you can use for free if you join the presidential club on-line, small grocery store right around the corner, Millennium Park down the street and a short walk to Michigan where you can find almost anything you need.;4;1;1;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
550;5/25/2010;lD6qoQy5Vvx7VOOR5HCknA;DsRGk9IUdzmu5Ko3seIdwQ;A Definite Winner!  Stayed here for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday), and had a wonderful time.  The grand entrance is a small bar area with check in to the right and a dual restaurant bar area to the left.  A set of grand stairs directly faces you, you know you are at the right place.  The rooms are decently sized, the sheets are organic and bed was soft:I loved the small vanity area as well as dual shower and bathtub.  Let's not forget the adjustable flatscreen!  Loved it! The room resonates modern minimalism, clean lines, simple colors and plenty of compartments for all your needs.  This hotel is walking distance to the train and plenty of buses to get around the city.  Here are 2 small complaints: 1. Towels could use some downey 2. Restaurant/bar called Aria is below par and over-priced Nonetheless, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who's visiting the city for a weekend and looking for a great place to share in the moment.;4;1;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
551;1/9/2012;S4W0Jp7RRikaPAT5Snq76w;hU45HmIstzkGcF0Xoz1niw;Pros: Staff was very pleasant.   Beds were comfortable. Cons: $10 per day per person to use the fitness center. The coffee shop in the lobby is absurdly expensive ($3.50 for a medium drip coffee, $5 for a scone) and the coffee isn't great.  I would have vastly preferred Starbucks. All around, not as nice as I expected for a Fairmont.;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
552;9/9/2010;40t0ZHgql3f7SF-rgYd6aA;Agf6L4QPq9oCKTaz7odUkw;So here are the bad things that I encountered at the Fairmont Hotel since that is pretty much what everyone looks for first. -Must pay for the little things like internet and jacuzzi. -There is no swimming pool. This really sucked cause my view from the hotel looks into the Aqua Condominium's pool area, which looked refreshing. -Only has one trash can in the room.   -No dressers to put clothes away. -Small closet. On a side note...the cab drivers are the worst (except for one). I wonder if they live in their cab. The front seat of every single cab we took had junk in the front seat, like Dunkin Donut coffee cups or leftover wrappers from yesterday's dinner or lunch. Just take a peek in their front seat.   That's it!!! Everything else was delightful. There is a reason why you stay at the Fairmont and that's customer service (and the most comfy beds for vacation). From the valet to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and eager to please. This Fairmont Hotel seems a lot more hip that the other Fairmonts. Two blocks from Wacker, and four block from Magnificent Mile.;3;1;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
553;10/25/2010;Q7FyKg1z3;gWILyRVqn5QA3b9Rrhz-9g;I stayed here for four nights this fall for work. Hands down the best thing about my room were its size and the fact I could see the sun rising over Lake Michigan between the buildings every morning. The location was convenient, the king sized bed comfy, and all the finishes ultra plush. The bathroom featured a shower stall AND a tub. And the toilet was in its own closet. The TV was huge. one strange thing - i could hear EVERY time my neighbor showered or flushed the toilet. Very weird. And annoying. The lobby is ginourmous, with a small bar in the center with a nice selection of wines. I did like the revolving door that activated when you approached it. So yeah, the hotel is nice. But over the weekend, when I was footing the bill, I moved across the river to the Courtyard Marriott on E Hubbard street. The location was equally convenient, though we did have to walk 2 more blocks to Millenium Park. The rooms were smaller, the finishes less nice, but the service was superior. Everyone was so nice! The security guard got me ice when he was passing me in the hall and noticed the ice maker wasn't working for me. And they had a pool/jaccuzzi complimentary to guests, AND I didn't have to pay $14.95 for internet. BTW, the $14.95 for internet is for a 24 hour period that starts at midnight and goes until the next midnight. If you, for example, went out to a work dinner as soon as you got in and then wanted to check your email when you got back to the room at 11 PM, you'd pay $14.95 for the one hour until midnight, and then have to pay for it again at midnight. Apparently the internet is complimentary for gold club special people, which I was not one of. Either way, it was spotty, which is annoying especially if you're paying for it. Next time I visit Chicago, I'll probably stay elsewhere. Unless you're a rich person who doesn't mind being nickel and dimed, or you're here for work on a conference, I'd recommend you do the same.;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
554;7/11/2011;HPtaK8ejNLiglWuO-1ePng;ameQ9shbfXZF23J2p6khhQ;I spent the fourth of July weekend here and I enjoyed my stay immensely.  The Fairmont is an ideal location for an out-of-town visitor.  It is on a very traffic street itself, but surprisingly central to everywhere you want to go.  I ate in Aria and enjoyed my dinner very much.  The staff were invariably friendly and competent.  I was upgraded to the Gold Level and enjoyed mytime in the Gold Lounge.  Christopher is a super nice guy and will do all he can to accommodate your request.  The room was clean and spacious.  The bathroom was just beautiful and there was a nice roomy closet.  I was very satisfied.  Join the President's Club and wifi is free with the room.;4;2;1;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
555;2/10/2010;B20XRX4-gKnHxW;0in2lZcHmh6VqFq7_0nhUg;Clean room, and quiet, albeit much smaller than I expected. I kind of feel I got the overflow room.

Nice 38" flat screen. Work desk is simple and nice with plugs and eithernet jack built into the top.The decor lamps hang awkwardly low. Bathrooms with separate tub, shower, vanity and toilet areas (almost nicer than the room!) The toilet looked like something out of a newly renovated truck stop. Dunno what that was all about, but hey, it flushed and worked. Staff is very thoughtful and prompt. Down side: room was unnecessary  drafty. Vent in the hall blows cold air. The doors aren't designed to really seal so a cold draft blows through the room. And it was 9f outside.. brrr...;3;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
556;8/19/2008;RbU5IAf1UqCkZZ4MHIMsGg;Q-uZnIKZ2Vdq00WRYgeIiA;This place disappointing for a high class hotel. Service is only marginal, staff is a little ridiculous and they nickle and dime you along the way. It's definitely nice decor, nice location but while i was trying to have a business phone call in the morning before i checked out, maid came by 4 times throughout the morning (as early as 8.30am) although the checkout is not until 12. I expect a lot more from a hotel of this class.. Also when i got there stuff like coffee, drink glasses and such was missing.. once again a high-class hotel like that does not have second chances when it comes to some of these basics. I would say go to W Lakeshore or Four Seasons if you want a nice place to stay.;3;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

558;11/18/2009;3PG3mOT0HmRa6TvGiC2WSg;ZA6K6s4E1aI0eiAmjPlGSg;I stayed here in May og 09 because I got a free stay.  Yes, it was free.  My company is in the Aon Center (which is connected) and they gave all us administrative assistants a tour, lunch in the Aria restaurant and a free one night stay. Anyhow, I had a king room on the 29th floor with a park view.  The park view is high on my list of things that do not suck - I get no view at work since I don't have an exterior office.  The bed was awesome.  It was like sleeping on a puffy cloud on a warm sunshiney day in heaven. We also decided to splurge on room service.  I got a steak.  It was done the perfect shade of medium rare.  It was also crazy pricey.  $113 for my meal and my BFs meal.  However, when I called they were all "How may I help you, Ms. Diggs"  Which I totally got a kick out of. Maybe they were being extra nice to me because of the nature of my visit and due to the fact that our companies have a deal, but they brought me up a complimentary Perrier and a fruit plate.  Not a fan of the Perrier, but the fruit was delish! I did buy some snacks and beverages at Bockwinkles (this was before the CVS was opened - it opened two weeks later) because I didn't want to pay for anything in the mini-bar, but I do expenses for a lot of travelers at my work and I knew those items would be vastly overpriced. The room was pretty big, the toilet had its own separate area from the shower and bath, and the food was good.  I have no complaints.  I'd stay there again if I came into some money or wanted to have a nice weekend with my BF on the town.;5;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

Luckily, I was able to experience the Fairmont Chicago. Here's the breakdown: + AMAZING bell boys. So funny and personable. I felt like a guest, not a tourist. They made me feel very comfortable and welcome. + AWESOME VIEW at the 22 floor. I was able to see the tall buildings and snow fall from a higher elevation. It was epic. + GORGEOUS interior design. We had two beds and the pretty flower artworks on the wall matched the color theme of the room. +WHOA, COMFY ASS BED. I wish I had this at home! The pillows were coshy and the comforter was like a million marshmallows hugging my body. +HD CHANNELS, NO WAY! Plenty of choices and in high def no doubt. Not too shabby. +UBER FAST elevators. I hate those slow crackity ones that smell like old fart. Plus these had clean mirrors to double check your morning hair do. + PRETTY SCENTED lotions and soaps. It wasn't floral or manly. It was a neutral smell that was fresh and sweet. I brought some home...:) - SLOW shower. I'm into the waterfall types of shower because they're pretty to look at but damn, it took me a while to wash the day away. A++++;5;1;0;1;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
560;12/29/2009;7A0tuiSaNHHXjtG3XpVHbA;EmFY93AVd7w1oLsWd4mZHw;When you walk into the lobby on a cold blistery Chicago night, you're dazzled by the warmth of the lights and the contemporary feel of the bar & the restaurants on the first floor. Their rooms however seem a little cramped and for someone of slightly less than average height as I was not able to reach the cord to close the shades for privacy. Bad planning Fairmont. Yet again bad planning in the bathroom. The shower was a rain shower, which meant having to spend twice as long to rinse my hair and with no angle to the shower head, washing was not as easy as one would like. The bathroom is probably the biggest reason for the low marks. Everything in there seemed cramped and less than functional. While there for an event I experienced one of the ballrooms and the Moulin Rouge room. The ballroom needed some serious updating, everything just felt old and out of date. the catering was also mediocre. While in the Moulin Rouge room, there was an interesting layout with some great wallpaper, though the carpet horribly clashes and is distracting from some of the unique features of the room. Food there was much more interesting & satisfying. I've heard that Aria in the Fairmont is supposedly the best sushi in Chicago, though it's good & I loved that they were willing to make my favorite roll that was not on the menu, it is be no means the best I've ever had. The best thing about the Fairmont? The beds themselves. They were very comforting after a long day of traveling.;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
561;1/2/2011;swUXhybovENGMWCUerDUSg;ZKlOnMidHbjqmCaeb5utyw;ooooh is this place classy.  i got a last-minute deal for new years night and i am thrilled that i took the plunge and stayed at the fairmont.  the room was enormous, the rain shower was decadent, and the in-room technology was mind-blowing.  oh yeah, and the price was incredible.  this would be the perfect hotel to stay at for Lolla or for the Taste of Chicago. i docked a star for my only two grips: the bed was too hard for my taste and the lobby needs way more comfortable places to lounge.  their weird mid-lobby bar is awkward and the seating is just a bunch of bar stools and a few small chairs.;4;1;1;1;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
562;8/23/2010;68uSDA4wBsIHlS4cM522vw;WlpcReKr7hAcVDOJ2l9BeA;Our room was absolutely beautiful and what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Ok location, but if you plan on using the CTA to get around, it is a bit of walk to the transit station. The highlight for me was the bed/bedding...it was the most luxurious night's sleep I've ever had in a hotel room. BEWARE: Lots of hidden fees. Everything costs extra here (use of fitness center and pool, etc). P.S. The view was also pretty spectacular (and, yes that cost extra);3;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

565;12/15/2008;93afakrWAF5mb;4VR0SfMYEoBDy9JQ2tFzSA;I really like the decor of this place.  The rooms are comfortable and a decent size compared to other hotels at this price I've stayed at in Chicago.  The view from my room was of Millennium Park, which looked really great at night.  There were a few problems.  We had paid extra for a package that included a late check out time of 5PM, when we got back at 4PM to get ready to leave we had been locked out of the room, and had to wait quite a while for them to get it fixed.  Also, the rain shower shower head thing, looks good, but not really functional.  I like water pressure.  Other than those complaints, it was an overall good experience and we would come back again.;4;1;1;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

We've put other guests at the Swisshotel, I think the bathroom wasn't as easy to navigate, the bathtub was really high. Wi-fi wasn't important for us.;5;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

573;4/14/2009;tO3Uh7jxAnsMZeifjgPpFw;OCl8DzSfOaIFgj8pxH92_w;Love this place! Spent my birthday weekend with my friends here. They gave us a really nice room on the 31st floor with a really rad view. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The staff was outstanding. They gave us an empty mini fridge to store our drinks and food in for the weekend. The valet even told us a cheaper garage to park at for the weekend that was very close to the hotel. The bathroom was perfect for 4 girls to share it. Lots of mirrors, separate shower and bath and lots of lighting. Very close to Millennium Park which was great for the St. Patrick's Day parade. Great hotel!;5;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

576;7/28/2010;TsA700m46SzM1xG4V-ZVnQ;wCVf5amuVd0rVLTGIzoL2Q;Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. The "amenities" were a smoke screen, nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. Being charged $15/day for Internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head, unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. The staff were friendly and helpful, actually the best part of the stay were the staff. All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room.;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
577;8/25/2011;jfk2sgyUy4zNHn9q2v91zw;79Vv70bMS1JC9ASCg4dWqg;Awful customer service. They charged us twice for the room and we had to go through hell and high-water to get our money back.;1;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
578;12/23/2010;PvICmIdXacHmuhdxSCaryg;9nk02in9hJoQnEHibZUPmQ;We stayed here for 3 evenings in December, and it was an amazing experience.  Our room was gorgeous, and the bathroom superior to any other hotel I've stayed in I think.  Our friends down the hall did find the layout of their room a little strange - the bed was more in the middle in front of a faux wall, and they didn't like that.  (but since this is my review and not theirs, I'm sticking with 5 stars).  We splurged and stayed on the gold floor - and so glad we did.  It was well worth the extra cost....I have stayed on other "executive lounge" or "gold" floors at other hotels, and I'd say this was the best to date.  The food is more than enough for breakfast so you don't need to eat elsewhere...and the snacks the rest of the day would tide us over until we went out for dinner.  The staff in the lounge were very helpful! We all got a massage one morning, and it was an excellent experience.  They could only fit 3 of us in, so they said they'd try to call some staff and see if they could call someone in, and they managed to squeeze the fourth one of us in!  That's service - considering we didn't try to book it until the night before, and it's the weekend before Christmas. Will definitely stay here again, next time in Chicago.;5;1;1;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
579;3/28/2011;tavhLcQhTOCVF6Xu5GjGnQ;IlgCc6ZICTba2fBo6dW8Yw;Stayed here for a 3-night stay for an annual conference. MAJOR problems with reservations.I booked a room 3 months in advance and was displaced to another hotel bc they "overbooked"- I assume we were targeted bc our room was at military rates.  After a long flight & trudging through snow w/luggage I was NOT satisfied with this initial impression.  After many words were exchanged, we were shipped off to a sister hotel, brought back in the morning and rewarded with a suite on the 36th floor. Other than this initial migraine, staff was polite, facilities were beautiful, and conference was well-run.;3;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
580;7/1/2009;m;6lA-qP9WH_qrWf9p9nqwxw;I love the decor of this hotel. It is very edgy and attractive to look at. The wine bar has a great selection and the food there is great for a quick snack or dessert. The Aria Bar and Sushi is great for a snack and a drink before going out for a bit. I stayed there with my friend this weekend for her bachelorette party and the only thing I will say is at other hotels I have been to they give a discount or upgrade or a special treat for the guest. Our room was fantastic and classy, but the only issue I had was the beds are TOO soft, not comfortable when you have been drinking all night because your head sinks back towards the bottom while your feet feel raised up in the air. I woke up multiple times during the night because I was uncomfortable. The tvs are huge and the view was amazing from our room. Love the proximity to Millenium and Grant Park for the Taste of Chicago as well as the Art Museum. Only a 5 dollar cab ride to get to the busier parts of the city and the red line train is a 2 block walk.;4;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg

Needed a quick, cheap, centrally located one-nighter and while customer service does vary among different staff members and departments, it works fine. Got there too late to try for any upgrade deal. My floor was a bit loud at times. And in the morning I was entertained by the alley I was facing. An open garage business with guys moving stuff in and out struck me as kind of funny. Enough for me to whip out my camera. I'd return under similar circumstances.;3;2;1;1;purV29eUqYRBrVvgqeyt_w
584;5/5/2011;C2zfAxlsB0FGm81a7e495Q;WgLtbfIO-6pHK4Tb3BkGtA;I stayed here for a nursing conference. Reservations were easy to get, the rate was great compared to the Grand Hyatt it was recommended we stay in, it was a 6 block walk from the Magnificent Mile, and free parking. Great, right? There's a billboard in the parking lot of the hotel. EVERY morning at 6am, work started on changing the billboard. Really? I could hear my neighbors talking in the bathroom, and the full conversation of the people upstairs. So quiet, not so much. Everything was clean, but smelled funny. Disinfectant funny. The bed was very comfortable. The facility had 3 elevators, and not all of them would get you to where you had to go. My car stayed underground and came out in 1 piece. No breakfast, but walking distance to lots of great places. The staff was great, very efficient. Until 5am when I got up to take a shower and had ice water. I called to the front desk and got a "run it awhile, it should warm up" after 10 minutes the water was still ice. In fact, after 14 hours, the water was still ice. I went to the front desk, and somehow it got fixed-well at least to the point I wasn't going to freeze in the shower. The knob was all the way to "scalding" and the water wouldn't pass to steep tea. The staff gave me suggestions for bus routes and passes, extended my checkout to 2pm, and worked with me on a payment issue for my stay, all of which was greatly appreciated. Would I stay here again? Unlikely.;2;1;0;0;purV29eUqYRBrVvgqeyt_w
585;7/12/2006;tKyVKh1qvLGVnTAidCTa7Q;lrvBE5PMCkvylXGSOJMsSA;It's nothing fancy.  But it's a place to hang your hat while you're in Chicago.  It has free parking, which is huge for out-of-town guests ... especially in this neighborhood (VERY touristy).  The rooms are pretty small, but I've found that for my unassuming family, they don't need The Drake or The Peninsula to make them feel good about themselves.  They'd rather spend the money they save & spend it on their darling daughter (hi ... that's me). Also, yeah, Pizzeria Ora is a heavenly alternative to the big ticket Chicago-style pizza places nearby & it's IN THE BUILDING.  No wait, equally as good 'za, & have I mentioned it's IN THE BUILDING?  Which, if anyone who has every survived a Chicago blizzard knows is HUGE.  Plus, I believe that when you stay there, you get free drink tickets to the bar.  Score!;3;2;0;0;purV29eUqYRBrVvgqeyt_w

The hotel has an excellent location as you are surrounded by restaurants, shops, galleries and other fun tourist attractions.

I have never had a hotel "find" anything I've ever left there and I was so impressed with the honestly and prompt attention this hotel gave to my lost item. The rooms are a bit noisy, but it's Chicago....what do you expect. If you turn the fan on on the window unit, it drowns out all the traffic noise and any noise from the hallway.

595;8/27/2012;SeqETSNO2HA4o8I6S02G0w;YdKlRsXg_TV50_bzzCgCig;Stayed at the hotel for an anniversary weekend staycation with my fiance. The room was nice and clean with a comfy bed and your usual hotel ammenities. The view was atrocious (a lovely construction site), so we just kept the curtains closed. We mainly stayed at this hotel because of the pool and their multiple restaurant options. Unfortunately during our stay the pool was freezing cold, there were only 4 total chairs available on the sun deck that were all occupied, and Shor was the only restaurant open during our stay (the food and service were more than subpar). We did get a really nice package deal, the romance package that included a bottle of sparkling wine, a chocolate fondue, and breakfast for 2 the next morning with late checkout. While the items included in the package were great, we had to specifically request all of it. If we did not alert the front desk of this, we never would have received any of it. I don't understand the point of having preferance selections when you book online if no one is actually going to pay attention to them. Overall, would I stay at this hotel again for a staycation? No, probably not unless there was some sort of great deal. Would I visit the restaurant again? Hell to the no. Would I recommend this hotel- sure, but only if you're here for a convention at McCormick place.;3;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
596;8/21/2012;Frrgq-Vk2wQ-jvfkyrjy4g;VBv17gn3h9W2AChr6fWZjw;My husband stayed here for a little birthday get-away from our apartment.  Got a steal on Priceline.  I guess I was just not that impressed. Pros: Beautiful modern lobby, extremely comfortable beds (I slept SO well and woke with no aches), and immaculately clean rooms.  New carpet and linens.  Extremely friendly service at the front desk, and check-in was a breeze. In addition to the standard bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner, they give you a travel size toothpaste.  Gotta take pleasure in the little things, right? :) Cons: Expensive parking - but if you're like me and not willing to pay $35+ per night, you can find free street parking a few blocks away, on the west side of McCormick place.  For a 4-star hotel, the room decor was pretty lackluster, the furnishings were updated, but not such that I felt like I was in a 4-star hotel.  No bathrobes, no showercap, no bath mat, no tea bags, no fridge, no complimentary high speed internet.  Poor TV channel selections, and though we're pretty tech-savvy, it was impossible to figure out how to order a movie (although the girl at the desk mentioned we could do that and charge it to the room).  When we checked in, I asked the girl at the front desk if we could get a room with a view of the city, and she did manage to get us up pretty high (17th floor) but on the south side of the building, so all we had was a view of McCormick place and a little bit of lake, really.  My husband and I noticed on our way out that most rooms on the north side probably don't have a good city view anymore, because there is a new building being constructed right next to this one blocking the skyline. Overall, the Hyatt Regency just doesn't seem to be my flavor of hotel.  I'm sure it's perfect for the business traveler attending a convention at McCormick, but I wouldn't dare pay retail price for it and I probably won't recommend it to my friends if they were visiting Chicago.   Hint: Get good at Priceline's 'name your own price'... I got this hotel at 70% off!;3;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
597;9/26/2012;NlMJYvvbTIhoRzEd1AmsTw;Quazn4nNfdqnFIJagiAfcA;On Sept 4, I made a reservation for 2 nights at the Hyatt McCormick Place in Chicago. I usually stay at The Wit (a Hilton hotel that always provides excellent service) when I am in Chicago on business. However, the rate was very high, so I decided to stay at the Hyatt since I had a conference at the McCormick Place anyway and the rate was about $100 less per night. I ended up not needing both nights, so I cancelled the second night more than 24 hours in advance in compliance with the cancellation policy. In fact, I was assured I would not be penalized. They did not put the bill under my door. So, as I was reviewing my e-mails today, I discovered that Hyatt cancelled and did not charge me for the 2nd night. However, to my surprise, Hyatt charged $464.85 to my American Express card. Yes, a small portion of that was for parking and taxes. But you increased my rate for the first night pretty significantly! The original reservation was $259 per night. The rep said when I cancelled one night, Hyatt had to charge me the going rate for that day. I was not informed of that rate change when I cancelled the 2nd night. The customer service rep (whose name I should have gotten but I hung up because I was so mad) was incredibly rude, telling me "It is what it is." Since I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I decided to try my luck with that department. At least that rep was more professional, but she still said there was nothing she could do. I have stayed in hotels hundreds of times, and there have been occasions when I've had to shorten my stay and cancelled a night. Never was I charged more for the nights I kept! I talked to our fiscal office, and they never heard of such a thing either. I could understand if I cancelled both nights and booked an entirely different date, but the rate should not have increased for the original night I booked. Sticking with the Hilton chain from now on.;1;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
598;8/4/2012;K7GAp7R25sg;gFDWrYz_eBWedCCaZX55SQ;The darn room keys barely work! You can insert/extract them slowly, medium speed, fast, ultra-fast and it's hit-or-miss on getting it to unlock the door. Same problem with both my card-keys, other folks were having the same problem which led to a lot of knocking noises at all hours. People would keep trying to get into their rooms or they would knock if someone was already in the room so they wouldn't have to use the key. The a/c is a bit touchy and makes the room either ice cold or super toasty, you have to keep adjusting it as the temperature isn't constant. Rooms are a bit dark and needs more lighting, the closet is in the shadows with no light. The bedside clock/radio has both an iPod/iPhone dock and a USB port which is very handy to recharge things. Only one outlet on the desk lamp so you'll have to crawl under the desk to plug-in something else or you can plug something on the other side of the room. The WiFi is free but has a 200MB data cap for a single device, if you want unlimited data it's an extra charge. This is the standard Hyatt data plan, also if you go for the premium data package ($15 extra/day) make sure you do it over WiFi so you can use up to 3 devices for that package. If you use the ethernet jack you will be limited to that specific jacked-in device. The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere if you want to puchase things like food or other things. There are 4 places to eat in the hotel with the cafe being the most convenient option selling cold deli sandwiches, chips, drinks, beer, Chicago dogs, etc. I didn't eat at the restaurants. Little coffeemaker in the room with complimentary coffee/tea and housekeeping staff is very good about keeping it well stocked if you use supplies. Front desk staff is friendly, bellmen and other staff members are all friendly and helpful so they do have a good crew from what I experienced. Bathroom was fine, the bath mat towel on one day was frayed and torn with a faded nasty looking stain on it. Complimentary toothpaste is nice, the glasses for water are ridiculously fancy and on the small side so if you use them to pour a drink on ice you'll be refilling it a lot. Had a conference at the exhibit hall which is across the street from the hotel (there are a couple of enclosed bridges connecting the hotel to the exhibition hall for use during bad weather, just walk at street level in nice weather as it's faster). For the amount of money paid the value isn't really there. The exhibition hall venue was a bit disappointing and though it's not the hotel I thought I should mention it: No soap in bathroom dispensers, late coffee service for our workshops everyday, freezing cold venue, slow food service catered through the hotel (they kept running out of food, didn't have enough tables/chairs). The good part about the venue is it's fairly easy to find an outlet to charge laptops, free WiFi.;2;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
599;6/27/2012;B2eQgkbe;Zcy6LGh1gVKkYiX8lenlJg;It's in the middle of nowhere and the in house restaurants Shor and Forno close at like 5 PM and serve barely edible, over priced food like the $15 personal pizza that's not quite as good as a pizza hut pizza but double the price. On top of that it took nearly and hour and another 15 minutes to run my credit card. Over priced everything including the room because it's a convention center hotel. The room itself was average at best, definitely not worth the price. The staff aren't great either. The front desk staff are rude. The restaurant staff are inept. If you're visiting Chicago and your company isn't putting you up here, don't stay here. You can do a lot better for your money closer to downtown for you'll pay here and you'll get better quality and much better service. The only upside - Toothpaste. Yep, toothpaste. They give you a small personal sized toothpaste in your room so you don't have to ask for it or buy it if you forgot your own.;2;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

601;6/17/2012;o5MWgkgzNKg4psbNd5oQfA;Lly8yjfZBz1EpAPlZal7og;I came to this hotel to meet my fiancé upon his return from service.  Our first night together since he had come back home.  Complete disappointment for his return home.  We were given 2 double beds. They didn't explain this and when we made it to our rooms and discovered this and asked for a switch they said no that they were booked to capacity, didn't even offer a chance to upgrade to a suite.    I have worked in the industry for a bit and no hotel is ever booked to capacity without a major even happening in the city.  No one was helpful at all with anything, housekeeping or front staff.  The only redeeming quality is the parking attendant.   The lobby was ok.  But the rooms were dated and the beds were not comfortable.   For a few bucks more I could have stayed at a better hotel in a better location.  When I say better I meant the HOJO or Red Roof.  This says it has four stars but there is no way that it does.;2;1;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
602;3/9/2012;jC41zzFk474OZLCGwS1YFA;b36vogbQ2PD69h15k456Tw;So, the over all experience here was good except for ONE glaring point.  Hotels should do a couple of things right.  1. Have clean linens and bedding  and 2. have room service that is on time.  That said the Hyatt had a nice gym and pool.  Decent equipment.  It was conveniently located close the convention center that we were working at.  On our last day we called the night before for room service so that we would be sure to be able to eat before working since we had an early call time.  Well they called 15 mins after the time they were suppose to deliver our breakfast telling us it would be another 15-20 mins and if that would be OK.  WE SO ANNOYED BECUASE NOW HAD NO TIME TO EAT AND FIND ANOTHER OPTION.  They had all night to figure out their scheduling to be sure to have our breakfast served on time.   Sorry Hyatt this was totally unacceptable and worse you left us high an dry with out having breakfast and going straight to work where eating lunch is not option due to how busy the day is.  Hopefully next time you get it right and in the event of screwing it up you offer something in return for your mistake.;2;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
603;8/2/2012;9w4SF1YT4gMKs59-Dv44cg;aGe-6obZhiSAbo_lAkPnhQ;I pricelined this hotel and was very pleased. Yes it's off the beaten path but waking up with the entire Chicago skyline each morning made up for it. Cabs to the loop were about $7-9 before tip and always easy to get one. The room was clean, the staff were nice. About a 10 minute walk to Soldiers Field and the lake. For a weekend away, this hotel definitely works. I was in Chicago to see the city not the inside of a hotel room.;4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
604;9/15/2011;U4R5jqs7AIyCKX9K1rjQzA;mdPLZI0h_bBjC5imWYfYbg;I have never been so disappointed in a hotel before until I stayed here. First of all I was staying here for the Chicago 1/2 marathon this past August. I stayed here last year and didn't have this many problems until this stay. First of all, they let you check in early online which is nice and then print out this barcode that you can scan at their kiosk near the front counter to get your room keys.  When I got there NONE of the 4 kiosks were working.  When I went to stand in the LONG line (which is why I checked in online to avoid this) the front desk attendant told me that i should check all the kiosks. I said NONE of them are working, shouldn't you know this?  They didn't have a clue what was going on. Second, right near the breakfast/starbucks area to get coffee smelled of BO! It was horrendous. It smelled like that last year and it was worse this time. How can they NOT do something about that. It was just disgusting. You felt like you wanted to throw up Thirdly, at around 4am we heard drunk guys outside our hallway screaming obscenities at either other for about a half hour. It woke us all up and we were trying to get a good night sleep for our race the next day.   Finally, you have to pay for parking, which we get. BUT it was a hassle leaving b/c they were so congested and the scanner thing wasn't working on the way out so we had to wait for assistance. I received  a survey from the Hyatt asking how my stay was. Well I filled it out and let them know I wasn't happy with things and will not be staying there ever again due to all the issues we had. Guess what? I NEVER heard back from their management. Disappointed that they do not care to better their services and keep customers coming back. I will NOT be staying there again!;2;2;0;2;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
605;11/29/2011;griCDBStOXUsfDq9ptt39Q;qEv3LrfTm95_VJfU0hFQwA;I have been living here for two weeks. I get fresh towels and sheets everyday... Without asking. The room is always cleaned daily and smells fresh. I hope to stay here again. The down side is the trip downtown. I wish there was more around the hotel to do.;4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
606;5/20/2012;-dz0yG2hjFV3S-Y2sPOUDA;Kkwp52HHPANMQb2OgrFLJw;It was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I was there for two nights and house keeping never came in my room.....sleeping on dirty sheets and looking at old room service is the worst, so bad I made it my profile pic! Seriously the worst 4 star hotel period oh yeah for the inconvenience they offered me free coffee;1;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
607;6/21/2011;U4DjgHH9Iw0;n2bUMPbNNUxz0N2WkyiMjg;I worked on a startup in Chicago in 2010. I have stayed in this hotel for 115 nights since then..so there's little I haven't seen here - good or bad. One time, I hadn't slept in three days and was looking down at my phone while walking, so I even saw the ladies room. It smelled like roses. As someone who travels a lot, the single most important thing to me is service. You get used to the TSA, you can live with bad food, but the last thing you want is someone pissing you off or not meeting your expectations. This Hyatt consistently went above and beyond and earned every one of their five stars. What's good? Very nice building/rooms, amazing view, incredibly friendly staff, easy taxi access, nice gym, and pretty good food. What could use work? The prices are tough - room service is overpriced, and if you aren't a Diamond member, wifi could get expensive. Also, although it's extremely close to downtown, it's not quite walkable, and there isn't much directly surrounding the hotel. Staying there as much as I did, it was like being at home. 99% of the time everything was perfect (I even got scotch and cake on my birthday). What mattered more, though, was that when things weren't right, like a messed up reservation or loud neighbors, they were taken care of immediately. The Hyatt O'Hare is a slightly more modern hotel (less convention-y) but I stay here whenever I can. I saw the staff do extraordinary things for people time and time again, so I know this wasn't all because I stayed there so much. I'm actually coming back in August with some friends just to visit. I highly recommend the hotel and still hope that one day, I will marry one of the girls from the front desk in the Forno Italian Trattoria.;5;0;1;1;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
608;8/8/2011;j7Wb2qrDAXFLYHc1uC-5pg;fPzM8rESloa6Leh0Ye7D5A;After walking 1.5miles from the Adler Planetarium to get to the Hyatt the Staff was super friendly even though I looked sweaty and gross with my giant back pack I was lugging around. Everything I would expect from a 4star hotel pool-check sun tanning balcony-check fitness center-check 4different places to eat within the hotel- check King size bed and extra clean +roomy room all a major check. Reason why not 5 stars its a little further away from downtown but the CTA runs right outside the hotel which makes it easy to commute, and no free wifi Come on 10dollars a day?! its 2011 starbucks and coffee shops give free wifi If I'm staying at a 4star hotel I would expect that to be free too but oh well. I would come back when I'm back in town.;4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
609;7/12/2011;uepBc9AxPahvczT5E3lTTg;d_gt7E-ldc5zAZ0TVUnTYw;I stayed here for four nights back in mid-June and had a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean and all of the staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful. That being said, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I was actually attending an event at the adjacent convention center. It's out of the way of downtown and, although the Chinatown L stop is only a few short blocks away, it's doesn't seem like a safe walk after dark or for a female walking solo (like me!). I did like that I was upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival and that they had a boarding pass printing station in the lobby. The free WiFi was hit or miss:you literally had to be a few feet from the lobby to get a good signal. Not a major issue for me, but if you're traveling on business it might be good to know. There is WiFi that you can pay to have in your room for around $10-$15 per day. Next time I'll be sure to stay at a more central location to downtown attractions.;3;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
610;7/18/2011;cs9xgCUdy7gODWafbN9jFA;iv_QXg5Zqlw72hqS-le6Bw;Was in town for the night and needed place to crash, got a great deal through priceline.  For the price i paid, the hotel was outstanding, and i really liked the self-checkin kiosks.   The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit out of the way, which is probably nice if you are doing something at McCormick Pl. I was using public transit and the 21 bus was spotty, it also doesnt run until 6am on Sundays, so if you have an early flight you're taking a cab.   A courtesy shuttle to/from the Cermak red-line stop would be a GREAT addition and give alot of added value to this hotel.;4;1;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
611;6/16/2009;K2Vx5WgxYiduBG6MHGZuGQ;XKAFikZAfddYv0Vg1PUkwA;I should preface this review that this hotel is very far from all of the touristy things in Chicago.  While it's not too far from the museum campus, you'll have to cab it, especailly with little ones. The room was very large, bed was SUPER comfy, and had a great view of the lake and Soldiers Field (how cool!!)  Everything was spotless, and service was spot on.;4;2;3;2;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
612;5/18/2007;FE6MG955dRjWbAMlCuBIXQ;FVbtQgcCmWmQ-D6IR5BfZg;Very nice lobby and lounge area amenities. Rooms are in good shape but overall are not that great - I hate that there is not a real closet but rather a rack with a curtain in front of it. While it is attached to the convention center it is still a hike. Also, the SHOR restaurant, Forno quick food and M/X bar are all good. I was especially pleased with the pannini at Forno. The best thing about this place? I dropped my Tiffany bracelet down the drain at 2am and the plumber came right away and looked for close to an hour for it - he found it and I appreciate him trying so hard...;3;2;2;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

617;9/17/2009;HugLiTQaLZNaheouKRGfZA;aoTnCXg4_sllZxNJeTDHAA;Let me preface this by saying that we were in town to see U2 at Soldier's Field.  The show was our #1 priority so the hotel was really secondary to the whole experience.  This hotel was the closest we could find to Soldier and it was "alright."  Our room was comfortable and clean.  The fitness center is well-equipped and open 24 hours a day which is a really nice feature. The downside: For what you get, this hotel is overpriced.  It's a totally average business-minded hotel.  The lobby is great, but the rest is very very average.  It is not close to public transit, downtown, etc.  Also, the folks working at the front desk are unfriendly and borderline idiots.  They managed to: - eff up our reservation - charge us for our room twice* - waste a lot of our time - almost lose our bags Needless to say next time I am in a similar situation, I'll be staying at the W or the Park Hilton and cabbing.  Way better service and more bang for your buck.   *Also..... to the folks at the McCormick Hyatt: I am still waiting for those charges to come off my card.  You will be hearing from me again.;2;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

The people were wonderful, the room was lovely, great view of Lake Michigan, and very convenient for the convention center. Check in was easy, but on the third day I checked my credit card and realized they made a mistake. They were charging me per night even though I had prepaid. I was worried it would be a hassle, but a quick trip to the front desk and they took care of it right away. There is a restaurant on the main level, an Italian carry-out type place and little "coffee shop" called the Daily Grind. The "lounge" advertised is not really all that. It is simply a more bar type extension of the restaurant. I did like that there were seating areas, with mini coffee tables all around the area of the restaurant and coffee shop on the main level. Also, free wi-fi not only in the rooms but throughout the hotel and the convention center. Made things much easier. Gym was awesome with another great lake Michigan view. Overall nice experience.;5;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

The comfort of the room was amazing, very nice beds, room can go pitch black so you get no sunlight, and the cleanliness of the place is spectacular. I didn't notice all the shops they have down under till the next morning, but they do have a small store and a very relaxing lounge area with couches. I priceline'd this hotel so I got a great deal.

The only two redeeming points were that - - The fitness center was pretty nice, not the best I've had at a hotel but nice.  But the water cooler they have is WAAAAAY over-lemony, like sucking on a lemon.  Gross, especially coming off a hard workout. - We got continental breakfast in the mornings of the conference which was actually pretty good.  Fruits, cereals, parfaits, pastries.;2;1;1;1;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow

Rooms are big, comfy big beds, my only complaint would be the super small fridge for a 2 bedroom suite.  We were obviously holding meetings there, we needed supplies (water, drinks, etc) to entertain our clients...  But we made it work.  Service was really good, but I do recommend you order room service with time, it takes about half an hour more than they say it will. They obviously have wireless service, shipping service, screens at their lobby with flight information, and computers to print boarding passes.

Our room was booked through http://Hotwire.com (which is probably where everyone else that day booked their room, since there was no convention that weekend) and so it came over with a single King bed reservation even though I reserved for 4 people - a knock against Hotwire, not the hotel. Hyatt was happy to move me to a two-double bed room. The room had nice beds and linens, but the pillows were uncomfortable. The elevators were swift and to echo everyone else's statements about the gym: amazing. For gym enthusiasts: free towels, including chilled ones - free headphones, free water, music playing, TVs on, tons of cardio machines, free weights, jump ropes, resistance bands, medicine balls, balance balls, a full range of ROM weight machines, roman chair, etc. - really - AMAZING. The locker rooms have lockers, showers, sauna!! The pool is silly, it's more of a kiddie pool than anything, but the gym is 24 hours, so that's a huge plus. There aren't a million TV channels, and the internet is for-cost but those weren't material to us. It would've been nice to access the internet for questions about where to go to dinner, but the concierge was more than helpful about that. The hotel has really thin walls, we travel with a sound machine, but I could still hear TV in other rooms at 4am - lots of doors opening/closing late at night in the hall, too. Toiletries were above average and nice smelling. Plenty of towels. Room included iron, hairdryer (on closet shelf), bible, chairs, floorspace, mirror, bench. The split bathroom was nice for people traveling with more than one person. Temperature in the hotel was just fine for us, perfect for sleeping. For-cost amenities are over-priced, but we avoided them by bringing out own snacks/drinks and eating elsewhere. I would stay here again!;4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
630;11/3/2009;1MlClnhuWm4Qv19BhZhjxA;s54TF5n6M3lFdFc8ysaghQ;First--I did not stay at this Hyatt, I am basing this review on the customer service I experienced regarding clients that were staying at this hotel for a conference. Trying to contact a helpful person at this hotel is like pulling teeth.  I called to see what needed to be done to get welcome gifts placed in each guests room (about 10 guests).  I was transferred around on the phone a total of 6 times and still no one could answer my question.  I was told a manager would call me about it later---never got that call. Once I finally did get answers to my questions, I dropped the gifts off on a Friday to be placed in guests rooms over the weekend (I gave clear instructions to the manager with a list of full names)  She assured me that they would get these gifts in the room (mind you its $3 per drop off). I called on Monday to confirm the drop offs.  First time I called and asked I was placed on hold for 15 minutes.  I ended up hanging up, calling back and spoke to the same manager I left instructions with on friday---nope, no drop offs---and no explanation. So I had to go into bitch mode, to make sure these gifts were delivered ASAP (she actually asked me "when would you like me to get them to their rooms?" I wanted to scream: YESTERDAY!) Is it just me or shouldn't a hotel have exceptional customer service--atleast a hotel at the Hyatt level?  Very disappointing.;1;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
631;7/12/2010;YcuPMssnQ2KFzl2neqtNsw;cqOPLW00drpjIV43ZaaS4w;Great location if you have a car.  Really easy to get on the 90 and/or lake Shore Drive. Front desk manager appeared genuinely insulted when she saw how great my  hotwire rate was (it was really great, less than half the price of valet parking at  the other Hyatt...) Room Window opened 5 inches-good by today's standards. Air conditioning was adequate through the night. (some hotels cut down on AC late at night) Only one front desk person was outstanding.  Two were rude. I rented two rooms, one for me, one for a friend.  In order to get to the room at night, if you have a rental car, you must pass your key card to get into the parking lot, pass it again to get into the elevator and again to get into your room. the key failed at one of the three key  points, on nearly every trip. At one point i had them make me three keys, and NONE worked.  my friend made through the three-key gauntlet only once without a front desk change of keys... other than that, the beds were great, room was clean. soaps were a little heavy--if  you want something unscented or not waxy bring your own.  All in all, a fine generic hotel experience with the usual chain store problems--no one in the hotel seemed to take responsibility for the issues.;4;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
632;6/13/2010;nRkbXpRaWMo3JYZ3ChcqTQ;ZG6c3GaUjBf-wNhSbKYbpA;I made a reservation for June 11th on hotwire. Had to wait in line with 15 other guests and only one poor receptionist. I asked if she could get her manager so we could expedite the line. Was told the manager was in her office!. Guests should be your main concern if you are the manager. So, facing a 45 min wait to check in I thought I would use the self check in computer. Oh silly me!. Of course that was not working either!. A concierge named Chris finnally checked me in. He was very polite. I gave him my credit card for incedentals and my hotwire reservation #. He swiped my card and said my card was over it's limit. It was not. I had to call the credit card company and have then explain to him that he was incorrect. Then 10 min later he was finnally able to find my hotwire reservation. I had called the hotel in advance and had been offered a queen non smoking room. Since I have severe asthma. When we got to put room it was two small beds in a smoking room!. I will try and never stay in this hotel again!. They need to train their front desk staff including their managers.;1;1;1;1;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
633;7/30/2010;b;RaE1cBKsuBkpd1jrV9HycQ;There were HUGE SPIDERS all over this hotel. The were on the pool chairs, in the lounge, in the outdoor seating areas, and even in our room! I got a few bad bites while I was staying there (and still have the scars over a week later!). The Hyatt is also in the middle of nowhere, in a deserted, fringy neighborhood. I'm a city person, so people drinking on the corner and shouting at me doesn't really upset me, but my 26 year-old suburbanite sister was really freaked out. In (safe) walking distance of NOTHING, not even a bullet-proof deli.;1;0;0;0;BqJ10kFkEJi5jdjRfyURow
634;9/29/2011;5qxG2uzhsNaVxMXgUM7irg;HMFAz4K5ZeMXcAhbEmMS-Q;We choose this hotel based on price/location. Now with that the hotel is smaller and not as glamorous as other Chicago hotels but better then other Best Westerns I have been too. The rooms are small which is perfectly fine if all you are doing is sleeping and relaxing in between all the wonderful activities Chicago has to offer. The bed was comfortable and I felt like most of the room was updated nicely. The location is the best you are right across from Grant Park, down the street from the Aquarium, and the Art Museum. For people that do not want to walk down to where all the shopping is on the Magnificent Mile then this is not your hotel. It was a decent walk but it was perfectly fine for my husband and me. Parking is valet but we did not use our car once we were in Chicago we simply walked or took pubic transit.;4;2;1;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg
635;2/22/2012;9Q8hMGnfHTKBp5tbNzqxlA;fkVV3pPLCsN0sFsusyIJ7g;The hotel staff was attentive and quick upon check in. After having trouble with the internet they were also eager and swift to help. The rooms themselves are clean but out dated. They feature the usual ammentities and an old fashioned television set. The location, however, is great. It is walking distance from a lot of the popular Chicago attractions: shopping, Grant Park, Milenium Park, just to name a few. There is no room service but I recommend take out from Yolk, a nearby restaurant.;4;0;0;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg
636;8/1/2009;acYoT8bpva15GzKZxE-Zgg;eysom1YBJ_9Qh6m3emAvpQ;Time/Date: Tuesday, 12:30 am Type/Quality: One of the cheaper hotels by Grant Park. It is very clean and comfortable:don't expect frills. Its what you want if your looking for site seeing, wandering around the waterfront, and the food/touristy districts. FREE INTERNET! THUMBS WAY UP. Price/Quantity : The company books cheap rooms, so it couldn't have been expensive Service/Accessibility: The venue is right off of main streets, and easy to find if your walking. It doesn't have a lot of parking but its perfect for travelers. The service is regular "chain hotel friendly". They will watch your bags if you want to sight see after your stay and they will leave a key for you if you are coming in late. Structure/Ambiance: Clean and comfortable. The internet is FREE! that makes it wonderful.;4;2;1;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg
637;8/5/2009;K7SCFuoxVVlWbre7mxXLOw;lEZoMl9cEOAXEp3ZlUmeIw;I was not impressed with this BW.  It was the 3rd one I stayed at in 10 days and it was the most disappointing.  :( When we were checking in the lady was not very helpful answering our questions.  We asked about parking and she suggested a public lot.  Later another worker said they had valet, so we did that, but why didn't she tell us??  They also neglected to mention that valet doesn't open until 6 am and we were leaving before that...How to get the car??  The morning guy was VERY nice and got it out for us and it was waiting when we came down. The room was clean but not very comfortable.  It was very cold on in the room and on the floors.  The Red Line train was loud and you could hear everyone who got on/off the elevator. I think we paid too much for what we actually got.  But I would stay here again if I had to, I just wouldn't choose it.;2;1;0;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg
638;5/8/2010;GWSBk0JNAaZsWJAJUXSSdg;eJh-KBsNV5yka717jk9R1g;Good clean hotel. The only downside was their wireless didn't work BUT they did provide us with an Ethernet cable in less than 5 minutes even though they didn't have one at the front desk.  We were able to connect but even with the cable the Internet was slooooooooow. The location is great as you are 3 minutes from The Metra and buses go by every 3-4 minutes right outside the door.   They have a local restaurant on their bottom floor, it is nothing spectacular but it saves you if you get back to your room late or if the weather forces you to stay inside.;3;0;1;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

640;10/9/2009;f576lIcwkMKJYd7QjHU9UQ;Y1T7sd4TKOe4utqV5hFdMQ;Slowest. Brunch. Ever. When Yolk up the street had a 45-minute wait for Sunday brunch, I opted to come here with my parents, who were in town for the weekend. When we were first seated, alarm bells should have gone off when we had to repeatedly flag down the wait staff for coffee. Matters did not improve by the time we ordered. It took almost an hour for our dishes--not complex to begin with, think oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and fruit-- to reach the table. Although the prices are reasonable and the place was not crowded, do not let these facts lull you into thinking that the service will be fast.;2;1;1;1;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

Can't say enough good things about Chicago.  I'll be back!;3;1;1;1;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

Holly nice desk girl. Night staff underwhelming. I'm not messy, but I never had a housekeeper in my room the entire time. I would like to have my coffee replenished and fresh towels, but had to ask for them every night because the housekeeper didn't come to my room.  Loud door slamming ALL night, and someone kept smoking in the hall.  The heater was next to the thin windows so it kept going non stop and that side of the room was freezing while the other side was HOT.  The wall thermostat was broken so I had to keep walking to the thing to adjust it.  Also, the lighting sucks in the bathroom. and NO water pressure in the shower.;2;0;0;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

645;7/1/2012;3EokP8cuildA6DwiV-mRYg;Uv2w0adcdzDm_w5_zHZmYg;Even though I live nearby, we decided to spend a night at the Ritz for my birthday.  What a fun and extravagant experience it was!  The hotel is beautiful, the service wonderful, and the atmosphere decadent! Some things I really loved and appreciated: The room: -L'occitane bath products, the amazingly comfortable pillow top bed, the humongous windows, temperature control, beautiful bathroom, and a waiting bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries to welcome us!   -The window drapes totally block out any bit of light which leads to amazing sleep. -Also appreciated the phone in the bathroom (which actually came in handy once when I needed to call down but didn't want to wake up my boyfriend), turn-down service which comes with bottled water, a wonderful view of the city.   -He also asked to have chocolate cake sent up to celebrate my birthday and what arrived at 8:30 on the dot was an amazing chocolate cupcake complete with candles, matches, and a bottle of Evian to enjoy. The hotel: -The lobby is gorgeous, with crystal chandeliers and a fountain and a jazz band playing in the evening.   -The service was super nice.  I actually had a cold and needed some Advil, and called down late to see if the gift shop was still open.  They asked me to come down to the front desk, where I was asked if I was looking for medication (indeed I was) and offered a tray of options.  Cost $9 but was totally needed and I'm glad I didn't have to make a late-night run to find a convenience store. -Also each time you call the operator for help they call you by your name which is a nice touch. -Attached to Water Tower which was great for a little shopping I had been meaning to catch up on. Some random things that could be better, but are not enough of a big deal to change the rating from 5 to 4 stars: -You have to take to sets of elevators to get to your room, and the elevators are a little small so sometimes you have to wait a little -Although my boyfriend added my name to the room (we checked in separately)--when I arrived I was treated a little like I was trying to sneak in or something, and it's interesting how the service is for a customer vs. a potential customer.  Very mild difference, but definitely different.   -There is a way to plug in your Iphone/Ipod into the TV to play music--however it is cumbersome (you have to download and sign up for this app called LodgeNet Mobile) and it takes a bit of time, and even then I couldn't figure out how to use it. -The wifi is free but not that good, actually turned it off and used my 3G network which worked a lot better. I admit I am super-high maintenance, but I loved loved loved the Ritz.  For a fun night in the city I would definitely come back again!  Can't wait to try the spa next time!;5;1;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
646;7/28/2012;HEyaKshWFs1BhuRvfaEXqw;drzHAHTHFnThHW0R0rOdDQ;This review is for the hotel cafe/bar and parking -- I did not stay here but visited friends who were (and forgot to check in on Yelp... #amateur). Coming from a Chicagoan, the location of the hotel could not be any more central:it's steps from all the major spots in the city. The lobby at the Ritz is lovely, but getting there can be a bit confusing as it isn't actually on the ground floor. I had my car valet parked (the prices are much higher than any garage), and then I was instructed to take the elevators to the 12th floor. Once I arrived, we went to the cafe for drinks. I had some of the best cappuccino I have ever had. I have no idea what it cost, but they were made with good espresso and had proper foam. I don't think I judge anything harsher in life than cappuccinos, haha, so if I say it was good, it was GOOD! They are 1/3 of a Starbucks tall (read: size of a real capp in Europe) but so good that I savoured every molecule vs. the mammoth Starbucks size which I gulp down in a few minutes. If it was $4-5, I would gladly pay that here because, although a fraction of the size, the quality was worth it. It also came with a wonderful biscotti that had cranberries in it, I believe.. Yum. Just yum. Our tray of pistachios was constantly replenished as were glasses of water:the servers were very attentive. There is also free Wi-Fi. My only complaint would be that there is no bathroom at the bottom. I didn't realize that I had to go until I was waiting for my car, and from there I discovered that I would either have to go back to the 12th-floor lobby or up to the food court at neighboring Water Tower. All in all, a pleasant experience. I wouldn't go back on my own, but if you want to invite me, I won't say no. :);4;0;1;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

I called the Ritz and they put me in touch with the doorman. He remembered the cab driver and, when that guy pulled up again, he rescued my padfolio and called me to say he had it! Kind of a miracle, no? I swung by on the way to my interview, got my padfolio, and tipped the doorman $5. Writing this, I feel bad for not giving him more.;5;3;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
648;10/18/2011;rdtnECTPt1juac3xqcyjIQ;ZBLZIOrO3DZJzDFlFO-bJw;WOW. Best hotel I've ever stayed at. I tend to like modern / minimalist hotels and while the Ritz wasn't that it struck a nice balance between old elegance and modern. The service was PHENOMENAL. The staff were what tipped the scale. Everyone was friendly and helpful. They help elevators open for you. Loved turn down service. Concierge was friendly when I asked for advice on places to eat. Facilities were great (nice pool and lobby). Location was convenient. The views facing lake Michigan were awesome. Loved that you could get your shoes shines for free by leaving them in a bag. My girlfriend joked that if they could legally walk you to the bathroom and hold your hand they would. It was a joke but exemplary of the extent to which they value customer service. Everything just came together. Very impressed. Video: View from our room: http://www.flickr.com/ph… Also, was very happy with the free wireless ( wifi ). It was slow but if that bothers you it is only $10 a day for faster wireless.;5;3;3;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
649;12/15/2011;f;H2DNqyt2CR5a8Gv3Jisqhg;Deca Bar is very nice for a jazzy time in Chi! IJazz Radio has free jazz at the Deca Bar on Friday nights. So you know I had to try it out. Though the bar did not start on time, the place was great, the food was gos food, and the wine was tasty. I tried a new wine line, Dr. Hermann (white):it was sweet, wet, and smooth. The price was a little above what I usually pay for wine ($9), but this was ok. I then tried something on the menu:the pork sliders. This was really good and I enjoyed each bite. I also like that nuts were served with the drinks...thanks for this! The space is so pretty. The were lots of seating around (comfy too). The sound for the music was also good. I liked that even though this bar is close to the hotel restaurant, you really can not hear them on the other side. Staff was good, service was ok. My only improvement would be for the hotel to have some professional signage about were the event was taking place. A few staff members did not know that the even is placing place nor its time. To my knowledge, it is open to the public, so we need to be aware of where we are going. Deca Bar was not listed in the ads by IJazz, so that is something all parties can work on. Other than that, I had a great time here at the Deca Bar and I can still taste those pork sliders...yum!;4;0;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

I found my stay at the Ritz-Carlton (technically a Four Seasons hotel) consistent with other Four Seasons experiences. Mostly the Austin Four Seasons, since I haven't stayed at tons of these hotels. From now on, any time I can afford it, this hotel brand is my number one pick. We were traveling to Chicago with a little one in tow, so a child friendly hotel was our number one priority. We arrived a few hours before it was time us to check-in, so the staff checked our bags for us, and we were able to go out to lunch and explore the city. Upon check-in, the reception gave our little nugget a stuffed dog to play with. When we got into our room (the lake view is great!) our bags arrived minutes later, then they brought us a crib complete with a care package of diapers, wipes, baby wash, etc. The location was perfect, and when the downpour hit on our first morning, we were able to relax with an amazing breakfast  at Deca and make our way to the stores attached to the lobby for some shopping until the sun broke through the clouds.;5;2;3;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

658;10/29/2009;UByM7N0mF-ylIGUuIWHCtA;DJHAt1ldC3-1UIxt1xJQPw;Most of the first afternoon of my neuroscience conference was spent running frantically through the convention center trying desperately to pick up a mobile signal (and cursing lack thereof) whilst checking out posters, bumping into friends, and juggling the week's worth of program books, so it's possible I looked slightly disheveled when I stepped into the elevator at the Ritz-Carlton. Mind you, I wasn't staying at the Ritz-Carlton, but a non-neuro friend of mine happened to be there for a wedding, and I wanted to squeeze in a quick visit.  I had her room number, so I was planning on just nonchalantly walking in and heading up like a normal person going to visit a friend in a hotel, but they have to make it so confusing for us plebians!  The lobby is on the 12th floor.  Who does that?? There was a fancy family in the first elevator with me, and it was clear that they were not pleased about having to share the same air with someone in a 2004 H&M coat carrying two bags, hair in a messy ponytail.  Fancy dad said to fancy mom, "you know what I noticed, these are the same elevators as at the Ritz in New York!" and really, it was all I could do not to jump in with "OMG I KNOW, isn't that greeeeaat??? I can't tell you how pleased I am to see that the old R-C is consistent in their design." When we switched to the 2nd elevator, they rolled their eyes and fancy mom said to fancy dad, "you know, at the Ritz in New York, you can't get in the elevator unless you have a key." It was then that I really wished I'd been dressed like a prostitute instead of a harried neuroscientist.  Just for fun, you know.  A little Pretty Woman quote fest, perhaps?   "Oh honey, I've got a runner in my pantyhose!  I'm not wearing pantyhose!" My friend's room was totally gorgeous, with a view of the lake and the ferris wheel.  It was all done up in decadent periwinkle blue (just like at the NY R-C, I imagine) with a giant luxurious bed and a 2-sink bathroom that was bigger than some NYC apartments (or the Blue Banana, if you're still with me and my PW references).   One day when I'm rich I'm going to come back to the Chicago R-C and I'm going to get in that elevator like a pro and with that awful fancy family watching, I'm going to hit the f-ing PH button.;4;9;10;14;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

Classic moldings, gorgeous floral arrangements (although I am pretty sure the orchids are fake), and picture perfect seating arrangements makes the lobby a great place for a drink, a date or afternoon tea with friends. I had a dirty vodka martini and my friend had the toasted almond martini... both were delicious.  Service was excellent, very attentive :)  I like that. What I love most about this place is that it's not a place to be seen. Just an elegant setting with great ambiance and service. I'll update the review when I stay at the hotel.;4;8;5;4;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
660;8/27/2010;iiektqngqcr1l3DVsaXouA;mHPauyLvuuPLXRUXvzi7tQ;This hotel has the most beautiful lobby in all of Chicago.  Guaranteed.  I know because we visited every darn hotel in downtown Chicago looking for the best lobby to take wedding photos in.  This idea was the perfect solution to a middle of July wedding where outside pictures would equal one sweaty bride, groom, and wedding party. The lobby has a beautiful fountain with lots of open windows that lets in lots of natural sunlight.  Past the fountain, there is a whole wing that leads to the ballroom areas and it is beautifully decorated with damask carpeting, beautiful chandeliers, and furniture that is equally modern and classic. The moment we saw it, thoughts of the Drake and the Peninsula were out the window. Of course, we didn't just sneak in with 15 people to take pictures in this beautiful space, we stayed here too!  We had an amazing suite with breathtaking views of the city.  It was probably the nicest hotel room I have ever seen, and was also the perfect space for the getting ready wedding photos....  And of course, the perfect space for our wedding night. I also got to experience the spa and I had an awesome massage and a fabulously relaxing experience in the steam room. It was the perfect stress reliever the morning before the wedding! If I was a total baller and could have a platinum wedding at any hotel in Chicago, this would absolutely be the one. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this hotel's amazing space for photos and experience the luxury of this hotel for our wedding night.  I am hoping we can make another visit on our anniversary.;5;3;3;3;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
661;9/17/2008;H5t9;0R5mhF_e9pf8ko5g8IHBqQ;This review is for afternoon tea only. My Mom and I love afternoon tea. We go whenever possible no matter what city we're in and usually the Ritz no matter the city is outstanding. It's usually a safe bet for excellent service and quality. Not so here. Now, I'm familiar with the Chicago Ritz. I've dined here many times for dinner and the greenhouse room is a gorgeous place to stop by for a drink (pink champagne is a must). But the tea? Expensive? Yes. Worth it? No way. So disappointing! Everything had been pre-done the night or days before and then must have sat in a refrigerator. It tasted like it too. It had that old food taste. And not just the soggy and stale sandwiches. Everything tasted old. My Mom thinks now that her salmon turned. She later complained of a stomach ache from something but we're not too sure what got her ill there. I probably dodged that bullet because after my one bite of turkey that tasted day old or older I was done with the sandwich portion. My poor Mom felt better the next day but had a bad night. So it was sort of like bad icing on a really nasty cake. There was nothing fresh. Even the scones seemed nuked and were cold in places rather than being recently baked. The rolls seemed pre-done somewhere else. And who eats a cold roll with hot tea? The tea was fair. I'm something of a tea snob and would guess they're buying in massive bulk at a cheap price. It's not Mariage Frères or anything high quality by any stretch of the imagination--but they'll charge you like it is. They treat their teas badly too. They plunked the green and the black teas down on our table at the same high temperatures and then let the leaves sit the entire hour we were there meaning the last cup of tea had turned bitter by then. It's like they filled the pots from the red spigot by the industrial coffee maker. This is not how tea has ever been served to us at any other Ritzes before. Each tea has it's own temperature and time. Usually this is completely respected and every attention is paid to the finest of details. Uh...not here. Add to that not one of the three servers working the entire room could give us any help in tea selection. We each said what types of teas we enjoyed and asked them to recommend some things and the servers went and asked each other before deciding they couldn't "decide for us" Huh? Hoookay...... I asked for milk for my tea (East coast girls don't do cream XD) and it took over twenty minutes for the milk to arrive. The ONE time tea was poured for us (the first), (and the pots were HEAVY--too heavy for my  Mom so I had to pour for her the entire time) was when I was in the ladies room. I came out to find tepid tea waiting for me. I also couldn't find a server to help when my cup had a huge sharp chip on the rim. After ten minutes of looking around, I gave up and drank from the other side. Ridiculous to have to do that at $30+! One of our water glasses had someone else's old lipstick on the rim. Yuck. We kept asking each other is this the Ritz? Srsly? Ew. Pretty room. Bad service. Bad quality. Horrible after experience with my Mom getting ill. Next time I'll try somewhere else. This is not worth it at all.;1;4;1;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
662;1/28/2009;slTwIh;4DDlXwIxDLoxN6ZSmqETtw;My fiancé and I stayed 3 luxurious nights in the Anniversary Suite for New Years.  We had arrived early so, we had the concierge hold our luggage until the room was ready.  During our wait, we ate at the cafe for lunch.  We waited 15-20 minutes for our meal. Since it was a minor inconvenience, the manager offered us 2 complimentary glasses of the Cabernet Sauvignon we were drinking.  I thought that was pretty nice...  I had the "Four Storey Hill Farm Young Chicken, Yukon Gold Potato Purée, Baby Turnips, Crimini Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Jus".  That was probably the most memorable restaurant chicken meal I've ever had.  The meat was so tender and had excellent flavor. Not too overpowering... The vegetables were perfect.   As we got to our room, our luggage was already set up for us.  I'm not going to blabber about the details in the room.  The pictures speak for themselves... That night, we attended a black tie event in the greenhouse area.  There was a live band, our own private ice sculpture at our table! And a gourmet buffet adorned with fresh sushi, rack of lamb, caviar, French breads and cheeses, oysters, and so much more.  It was a feast! The last night we were there, I also had tried the "Butternut Squash Lasagna, Butternut Squash Purée, Ricotta Cheese, Walnuts, Spinach"  -absolutely amazing... If you don't mind spending some coin for a luxurious hotel stay, this is the place to go.  Excellent service, convenient, great location, right at the center of the Magnificent Mile.  And I almost forget to mention I'm one of those gals that like 'free' stuff. -ha... I collected about $200 worth of L'Occitane soaps and conditioners.  Hey! It's good stuff can you blame me!? We had a fabulous time here...;5;1;2;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
663;12/9/2008;FmcABywYgD;FLzyGJwiBsem8fBjEHyjBg;My partner was offered a free night here, which we spent this weekend. Overall, our stay was fine. But nothing exceptional. Our room was oddly arranged, with the TV facing the desk and the chairs facing the bed and nothing facing the view. The chairs were highly uncomfortable, too. Also, $13 for a small pot of coffee in your room? LAME. I found the lobby rather ugly. It was nice to stay here, but I won't recommend it.;2;2;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
664;7/1/2010;-bMlpc0UQ9ofyetMDGGEOA;fYorzS4urCs9k1LtFFjh8A;This is not are review for hosting an event at the Ritz., or traveling on business at the Ritz. This is a "my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a night downtown" type of review. As such, our stay was a little underwhelming. The location, staff, and room service were all at a five star level but, sadly other aspects of our stay made us feel like this hotel is just not worth the price tag. Our room was a bit shabby, the mini bar looked to be on it's last leg and the carpet was coming up all along the edges of the room. While I was waiting for my husb to arrive, I tried to watch some TV. The cable service was terrible. Half the channels were out and it took about 3-5 seconds for the picture to appear when changing channels. There was also a slight error in our room service order (received decaf coffee instead of regular). We would have thought nothing of these small inconveniences had we been paying about $200 less for the room.  Next time we stay downtown we'll be doing  just that by booking a room somewhere else.;3;1;1;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
665;6/27/2007;i;CFNxTohUu5xr-mUPkBLT2A;Can you really go wrong with the Ritz? We stayed here for a little "getaway" one weekend. Everyone always knows your name, which I am still not sure how they pull that off. Service....impeccable, food the same, and drinks were great too. You really do get what you pay for. The room was a little "dated" in my opinion, but still had the comfy bed, fridge, and great bathroom. I can't say enough about the gym, I wish my condo had a gym like that. Headphones a plenty and great machines, and they actually had free weights over 25 pounds! Oh, and I also saw Juwan Howard pull up in his blue Ferrari, he looked a little tight in there, but it was still a sweet ride;4;1;1;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

On the positive: + Friendly and prompt doorman, he greeted us by name hours later when we left for the evening. + I really appreciate genuine courtesy, with no pretense.  We received that upon check-in. + The concierge knew we were in for the concert and had directions to Wrigley pre-printed upon our arrival. + Very clean, and well decorated room...spotless room/bathroom:drawer liners:white, I mean white, bedding. + Tasty and speedy room service - available at all hours (we ate at 1:00 am) + Lovely in-room breakfast...things that were supposed to be hot were hot and chilled things were chilled. + Early check-in request granted (11 am) + Late check-out request granted (Noon) + Great location + Beautiful lobby + Friendly and professional staff +++++ A lake view without requesting it...this never happens to us without an upgrade request. Stellar service example... - Although laundered, one of our robes had a nasty stain on the butt- ewhhh...we called their attention to it and we were rushed a new robe and our room-service bill was comped without even requesting that.  They just took care of it, and apologized three times for it. Room for Improvement - Housekeeping seems to have the glitches - stationary set had not been checked in a while...kinda ratty and marked up - stained robe in the room previously mentioned - morning paper/breakfast order had been placed via hang card, but  did not get turned in -  therefore our breakfast was not delivered at the requested time, and had to be reordered...when called to their attention they had it to us in record time with many apologies...the breakfast was part of our package so we were not charged for it. We would/will return.  Really appreciated being appreciated for staying. :);5;1;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

668;5/3/2010;iGksrzrfS0TUiWJGbnZIsg;dqwk2Zv5aKKZFmirn8kkZQ;I stayed at the Ritz on a business trip in Chicago. I must say that otherwise, this hotel is entirely out of my price range. The service was EXCELLENT and I loved my room... huge window... free wireless... comfy bed... large bathroom. It was all very elegant. My only complaint is that the general style of the hotel is a little too old school for my taste. Anyway,  all in all, it was a lovely stay. OH! AND the secret service was outside of my room all night the first night I was there protecting someone quite important... I never did find out who...;4;0;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

672;7/13/2009;p2ae6m5uo-Jq-xiHt7Sjbw;_YaCVIkKeiaq9h20z9QMKQ;With the name "Ritz Carlton," you enter this place with certain expectations. And I'm talking HIGH expectations. This was definitely not the case. My first impression basically sums up my experience here. My friend had picked me up at the airport and dropped me off because A) she's an awesome friend and B) I had just had knee surgery and had a full-leg brace and crutches and could barely walk, let alone manage my things. As we pull up to the hotel, NEITHER of the TWO BELLHOPS took one step towards us. Even after seeing me struggle to get out of the car, after watching me wrestle with my luggage (4 bags), and even after making eye contact with me, they didn't even flinch from their spots. I had to call them over before one of them reluctantly (and I could see it on his face) mosied his way towards me. MOSY?!? I can barely hold my purse and manage my crutches at the same time and this guy is MOSY-ING? It gets worse. He then proceeds to not say one word to us...no greeting, not apologies, nothing...and takes only ONE BAG! Did I mention I had FOUR? Before I could ask him to take the others, he was gone. In effort to keep this somewhat brief, let me list off the other terrible attributes of the stay: 1) after complaining to the front desk about the bellhop as I was checking in, she just stared at me blankly and gave a half-hearted apology. Nothing else was done. No comps, no speaking with the manager, nothing. 2) when checking in, she told me she no longer had king beds available and I would have to take a room with two doubles. That would be fine if I didn't have to sleep with a GIGANTIC BRACE on my leg with my husband next to me. Being that it was a romantic getaway, sleeping in separate beds was not the suggestion I wanted to hear from the front desk. 3) Although they moved us to a king room the next night, the second room had a constant yet intermittent rattle that would sound like someone knocking on our door. All. Throughout. The. Night. 4) They erroneously charged us for mini-bar items TWICE! Once upon checkout and then again when I just happened to check my credit card!!! What if I hadn't? I would've never known. 5) Lastly, when I called the front desk to challenge said mini-bar charge, they stated they would have someone from finance call me back. It has been over a week and I had to call them back myself. Never again will I stay at a Ritz Carlton. Not what I would've expected from such a reputable hotel. Truly disappointing and a waste of my money.;1;6;2;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
673;6/2/2011;TWliHL1VFHRPGJe9lVUZxg;yruTLOggpeMXoHu_O_Zd3A;From the moment we arrived, the reception staff at the Ritz were eager to please (and it didn't seem to matter I scored a discount deal on the room through expedia!). We were upgraded to a deluxe room for free, and within minutes of checking in, we scored a reservation at RL thanks to the very welcoming staff at reception. The concierge enlightened us on Chicago's must-see attractions and nighttime hotspots:she made us a dinner reservation at Mercadito and even arranged for a complimentary appetizer for our party, which was a welcome surprise as we were seated at our table later that night. Our room was sparkling on arrival and the housekeeping staff made sure to keep it that way throughout our stay. Overall great experience.;4;0;0;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

675;12/5/2006;DZ88QARjEaAD1JevHHknBg;J3Xd3a_pbOSx5YD4qw2SvA;the best service EVER. i had my birthday "coming out" party here and the attendants were phenomenal. l'occitane products, fantastic rooms, jaw-dropping interior design in the grand ballroom and in the lobby of the hotel. very pricey but not at all a detriment. you get what you pay for. the reason why i give it only 4 stars though is because the event-coordinator of the hotel was implying that there was something minutely wrong that most of my guests were of a certain discent which i found very very offensive. i know his point, that the ritz is this prostigious place.. pretty much wasp and probably never experienced this kind of event with so many, let's say, asians that weren't all so neatly groomed. but they were my family so i didn't believe it was right to question it- my parents paid twp arms and two legs for the hotel's ballroom services and we weren't disrupting the hotel in any way. he could have at least acted like it was alright. sheesh. and what's with the pool? just a lap pool? for a 5 star hotel i was expecting at least a nicer recreation type pool.;4;3;0;2;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
676;3/2/2009;YgLB9eWi2avBNCrqMJIP;JLOlSZ-HWXbTIiJxFEHb1Q;I always wondered what is so special about Ritz Carlton until I happen to stay there. As far as location is concerned, this particular Ritz is located in close proximity to the finest dining and shopping boutiques of Chicago.   As soon as I entered the hotel I was greeted by staff member who escorted me to the main lobby. The lobby has marble floors, thick carpet, lots of pillars, a fountain and chandeliers which gives it a very grand look. After the check in with friendly staff i headed to my rooms. The bedroom had dark colors like most of the European hotels with colonial style furniture giving a very majestic appeal. My bed room had view of the art museum and park across the street I received exceptional service during my 2 weeks of stay. They offer complimentary shoe shine everyday .I gave my clothes for laundry one morning and upon my return, I found two cane baskets on the bed with Ritz Carlton wax paper. My first thoughts were, hot fresh bread but when I opened it, it was my laundry, ironed and folded. I was totally blown away. they have a pretty decent gym/work out room with very courteous staff. they even provide Personal trainer service upon request. the locker room is even better than a country club with mahogany lockers, wool carpets and leather chairs. Honestly, I have never seen a locker room so nice. All in all, i was impressed by the personal attention i got . the hotel staff was extremely observant and seemed like the policy was never let the customer ask for it twice. Every evening upon return i use to find bottle water by my bed side, favorite music playing and bath robe placed on the bed. Perfect way to unwind after a long day. Not to mention having a cab ready at 8am sharp with out asking. As i mentioned, all the hotel staff is very attentive.;5;3;1;1;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
677;2/18/2008;xkA84WRxpaalU0sq9S5N4A;lEPe7NPIdyYa84T9rLmDTA;I have to say I'm oddly fascinated by hotel bars.   I've never stayed at this hotel but always find a way to visit the Ritz  in whatever city I can.  My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and order a Kir royal while I read the New York times and discuss current events with the bartender.  The Ritz here in Chicago is not bad- the lobby is large and spacious with a beautiful fountain which nicely drowns out the noise of your neighbor so you can relax.  The bar is located in the open atrium portion of the building so you get plenty of natural light which is fantastic.  The service, as you may have guessed-this is the Ritz, is exceptional.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I've been to the Ritz in New York and it is my favorite.  Take yourself there on a Sunday afternoon and relax...;3;3;2;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw
678;4/12/2010;WvfPX05xP;ZG6c3GaUjBf-wNhSbKYbpA;Just celebrated my sisters wedding here and spent a few days with my husband on the 18th floor. The wedding and reception was lovely.

679;10/30/2008;4k1LBqVnY5WrTVUW-Hzw8Q;mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw;I spent 2 luxurious nights here and I feel a bit odd giving a place like it less than 5 stars. But I have no choice when comparing my experience relative to my high expectations. To begin with, this particular Ritz can't seem to decide whether it's Pottery Barn or Roarin' 20s. Every time I walked from the 1920s bedroom area to the ultramodern bathroom it was like being sucked through a magical time warp. And yet, it took me literally 10 very annoying minutes to figure out how the "ultramodern" bathroom's shower worked because the valve's settings were all screwed up. And as for the 1920s aspect of the decor... it's just not my thing. I wouldn't downgrade the hotel by one star just because of that, but I'm just not a fan of the World War I era feel when I have the privilege of spending a few nights in the heart of downtown Chicago (which has quickly become one of my favorite cities in America, by the way). No other complaints whatsoever. The rooms are spacious. The views from my windows were awesome as they included both downtown and part of the lake. The service is top notch. The hotel is so fully-staffed that you can't walk 10 feet without finding someone to help you, which is nice because the hotel is so massive. I ate a few meals over 2 days inside the hotel and they were good (not excellent, but good). The location is of course perfect, if you want to be in the heart of downtown. The closest train stop, which I was adventurous enough to use to arrive from O'Hare, is barely 3 blocks away.;4;2;2;0;C5QxZbnHUdihyeUPzcZAVw

The service is fabulous, the location is probably one of the best ones and the decor is pleasant. The only thing where they lose some stardom is that it is very humid. Our clothes were constantly damped and the odor in the hall of our room proved that it was humid. Also the rooms are very small and though the modern deco makes you feel like a million bucks, there is little storage place and in the bedroom and the bathroom. Last point that surprised us was that a simple coffee was charged at breakfast. The breakfast price was quite expensive and I would have thought that the coffee would come with it. Or at least not been charged for a refill. So in general, totally in love with the staff, but hotel has its ups and downs.;3;1;1;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
686;4/30/2012;wFWTdhQ;96us9i9zB7QIxBtyRlhvDQ;My friend and I decided to use Priceline "name your own price" bidding war to book our recent trip to Chicago.  We bid for a 4 star deluxe hotel, but wouldn't be able to see the actual hotel chosen until our bid was accepted and paid for.   We ended up w/the Knickerbocker.  My friend and I ALWAYS murder words so to stay at a place called the Knickerbocker was priceless.  We're staying at The Kinkyfker. The Redenbacher. The Betty Crocker. Mutherfker. We looked at how much the room would've been had we booked w/them straight up.  We saved more than half the price.  Hands over our mouths we were like ohhhhhhhhhh y'all just got priceliiiiiiiiiiiiiined!! Joke was on us, though.  We believe the hotel puts the pre-paid priceline guests in the worst rooms ever.  Right at about 4 in the morning, we awoke to the sounds of rumbling and slamming and racket that should only be heard at a construction site or a honeymoon suite.  We called the front desk and explained the noise.  They responded with, "Oh, that's odd.  We'll investigate and see what's going on." We never got a call back.  So we investigated ourselves.  Turns out our room was RIGHT next door to the service elevators (hidden by a door that says "empoyees only" or some sht like that). At any rate, we were rarely in our room because Chicago brought out the rockstars in us so we pretty much just used the room to bathe and change.  2 things to note about their bathroom: 1.  Rain shower head.  Finally, my chance to reenact a music video of some girl w/long hair under falling rain.  But the water pressure was too light, so it took longer to get the shampoo out.  And I wasn't used to the soapy water all up on my face.  So much for that.   2.  Dual-flush toilet.  Designed to save water.  A button for number 1, a button for number 2.  Great.  But their toilet was hella high off the ground.  My friend was getting tired of giving me a boost. 2 stars mutherfkers.  2 stars.;2;14;13;20;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

You are close to Lake Michigan, shopping, dining, etc. The rooms are small but while on vacation, you are supposed to be out on the town! :)  The hotel staff is extremely friendly and responds promptly to requests.   Parking is expensive no matter where you go so if you don't absolutely need to rent a car, don't.  From O'hare, the cab fair is about $40.  In the city, you can walk everywhere, take the Ele train, or city cabs.;4;1;1;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
688;8/6/2012;w83KF5y5z;Ul8LcNLy3v9XdXjgvWPBuA;We had a great stay here and the price was very reasonable. We stayed for 4 days/3 nights on the weekend. The room was always clean and the bed was so comfortable. The shower with the waterfall and detachable spray-head were great! Our concierge Sheryl W. was an absolute pleasure! She got us reservations and wonderful restaurants that we all enjoyed. All 6 of us guys and gals really enjoyed ourselves! The two bartenders are a kick! Be sure and call "Floyd" by his psuedo name "RICO!" (As in Rico Suave)! This place was located in a great part of Chicago. We practically walked everywhere! Even to the Shedd's Sea Aquarium! I highly recommend staying here on your next visit.;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
689;1/12/2012;3W7muu;6--wberg4DYU3uHtgUuvYw;I was quite disappointed with this hotel.  You are paying entirely for the location (which is admittedly wonderful, sitting just off Michigan Ave), however the amenities are sadly lacking and the rooms are tiny. We had a standard room, which regularly goes for $190/night (although we had a Goupon for $89).  The room was spartan and small - the king size bed taking up nearly the entire floor space.  The bathroom has a tiny, uncomfortable toilet and the sliding door, while stylish, provides no privacy or sound dampening (hope you enjoy hearing everyone do their business).  The bed itself, however, was quite comfortable. If you forget anything (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc), the hotel has you covered - for prices that would make the mafia proud.  No complimentary toiletry items here, but you can buy a toothbrush for $5 or toothpaste for $8 from the minibar.  WiFi is $10 per day, which I found to be rather ridiculous.  Free WiFi is standard these days in almost every coffee shop, yet at $200 hotel it is extra? I expect far more from a supposedly higher-end place.;2;4;0;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
690;4/3/2012;5jsLTRCSCkefnlIBWswRhQ;n70xIenwXRLFy99oGKIoUA;This hotel was okay but not fantastic.  I was expecting it to be a lot like the Drake (which is directly across the street) because they were both built in the golden age.  But, believe me, it isn't anything like the Drake!   My best friend and I were in town for the Shamrock Shuffle.  We first checked in and walked into a smelly smokey room.  I went to go open up the window to get some fresh air circulating...well that's why it smelled like smoke.  There were cigarette butts in the window sill!  We went downstairs on our way out to tell them (I also took a pic with my phone and showed them as well) as I didn't want to be charged anything for the smokey smell thinking it was us who left the smell.  The receptionist apologized and said she would let a manager know but that was all the communcation that was made.  I would've thought a manager would've at least contacted me or something.   When going to take a shower, watch out!  You either have too much water pressure from the shower wand or not enough from the shower head in the ceiling.  I, got blasted in the face from the shower wand.  You apprently have to have a engineering degree to use the shower!   About the only positive of the hotel was David the bartender downstairs.  He was funny and hospitable.  Go see him! Overall, not a great Chicago hotel.  Will definetly find somewhere else to stay next time! Location was great though!;3;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
691;6/28/2012;edftMM-TvsF9PrhkSmg8ug;a6RrygQeLQ9d0ffAmQcxbg;Why is wifi $10 a day? Taco Bell has free wifi these days. The bathroom layout was inconvenient, and the air conditioner sucked.

692;9/16/2011;dCw;pLYECfDZx_FDWtJ2C8LvSQ;We went for a quick last minute  weekend anniversary get away and wanted somewhere nice but not too expensive. I found this place on http://hotels.com and it was the cheapest on a Friday ( considering it was a holiday weekend) and looked decent , and was across from the drake close to all the touristy things to do in Chicago. The downside is that we drove from Milwaukee and parking in Chicago is atrocious enough as it is but the hotels valet service costs $50-ish bucks and I was not happy about that. The good thing is there is a parking garage LITERALLY across the street that is only $35.. you can't take your car in and out though and that's only for 24 hours. SO we did that, problem solved. Deets on the Digs: Presumably re-vamped recently, outside of the rooms were kinda run down, I don't know if they pay attention to these things but door frames and floor boards were filthy and in need of a good coat of paint. The elevator was terrifying. I mean, talk about a death box. I am claustrophobic enough as it is but I could barely move with all our luggage. I overlooked these things because of the price and location and then get into the room and it is small but very luxurious. I read others reviews here about the showers and laughed because there's instructions IN the shower on how to use them and I have to say I don't think I've taken that many showers in a 24 hour period, ever. I loved it. The marble in the bathroom echoed and it kinda made me self conscious about using the loo considering you could hear everything. I would suggest some kind of better rug or something in there that would muffle the noise. Also the toilet was confusing, The flusher was on the wall above the toilet and has two buttons that do the same thing. I guess it's a "fancy" thing I don't understand but I thought it was unnecessary The bed was AMAZING.. if not for the fact that we wanted to sight see I would have stayed in and slept. I was so comfortable in fact I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Our bed at home is now an utter disappointment. We ordered room service twice and I have to say it was quiet reasonable. We split pancakes in the morning and they were delicious. My boy got late night cheesecake the night before and because they were missing an ingredient they gave us two pieces! Quite nice. Overall, knowing the small discrepancies here and there I would definitely stay there again.;4;3;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
693;9/29/2011;tZRWQpFLbscejMG98;w1lHu6I_xLDKHMXc4Cv5ig;One of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in....  amazing sheets, and perfectly padded for your comfort. The showers are also pretty neato too. Not only do you have a rainfall shower on top, but you also have the handheld shower that is propped up on the side, and that my friends, is nothing short of awesome. OH, and if you have room service in the morning, get the french toast with bananas.  And, get a side of bacon.  This is best if you eat it in bed. It's sexy trust me :);4;2;2;3;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
694;9/16/2011;bscGHVrtT-lWJbv4Bx994A;RdGgH2C655oklnPT3oZJ0A;We stayed here for 3 nights.  Great location as it's right off Michigan Avenue that you can easily walk to all the shops.  If you don't care for the hotel amenities, then this is is a decent place to stay. We were on the 10th floor, but right near the elevator which was annoying at times because we could hear people talking.  The room was smaller than expected, but I liked the modern decor and the 42" TV which was the biggest I've seen in a standard hotel room.   Bathroom was clean and up-to-date with a rain shower, but the toilet was surprisingly too high for me that it was a little uncomfortable.  The coffee and the coffeemaker were cheap and terrible for this hotel.  I think they need to upgrade both.   Internet was $9.95 a day, but we opted out as we did ourselves a favor by not doing any work.  From our window, we were able to see a glimpse of Lake Michigan.  Overall, a decent hotel.;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
695;2/27/2012;ehMZt2RyLzcr-i3hjEhr7w;aZmkHjoEHe2MRl2W_xAMfQ;As a frequent visitor to the the big city, I have stayed in a LOT of hotels mostly all through priceline bids and Groupons/Living Social deals. This one failed to measure up in too many ways for me to return. I went up with a group this trip and we didn't request rooms near each other, they did offer us adjoining rooms so that was very nice except they never sent anyone up to unlock the interior door so we just swapped a key and had to go in and out in the hall. Not too big of a deal but maybe annoying for the rooms next to us hearing the doors slam over and over. The elevators were tiny and although there were 3 one was broken with the door stuck half open. I will agree the bathrooms have zero privacy with every sound clearly coming into the room. No-name shampoo/conditioner and soap was pretty boring. Was also sad about the $10/day wi-fi and I don't know how they can continue that $50/day parking when there are 2 lots within 5 minutes of them that are $25 and $30/day. The valet parking does have unlimited in and out while the other lots do not. We wanted to have a drink in the lobby hotel when we got back from our nightly entertainment but when we walked up they were removing the bottles of alcohol and storing them away for the night. As we stood there discussing if we wanted to try walking elsewhere, a lady came up and ordered a vodka tonic with lemon. He made a tonic with lemon instead of telling her they were closed so then when she tried to pay and he said No charge, she got all confused (this wasn't her first vodka tonic!) and kept demanding they add vodka. He was telling her to go to her room and add it from the mini bar but I think if he would've just said we are closed, I can give you the mixer and you add the vodka, right from the beginning, there would've been less of a scene. Also, in the morning as we came down on our way to breakfast, we stopped for 4 coffees to drink on the way and it was over $20. For 4 black coffees, no lattes, no espressos, just drip brew flavored water. Didn't guess that was the average price or we would've waited until breakfast! I wouldn't buy another discount deal for this place but if I won it on Priceline, I guess it would do.;2;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
696;2/4/2011;INfNMVvguamtWQHaDFFqWw;EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA;I feel like this hotel should be rated much better in hotel class and overall rating than it is. I think very little credit is given where it's due because this is quite a nice place to stay. It has a fantastic location, the rooms are comfortably roomy for a city hotel and the price is literally just right. I was here for a week and I felt absolutely comfortable and happy to stay here. The room service was impeccable and very consistent, the bed was ultra comfortable, the showers were pretty awesome. The only complaint is that their toilets are so high off the ground. You know what I'm talking about ... The staff is friendly, the lobby is small but cozy. The bar at the lobby is nice and they have free wifi in the lobby. The bell men take extra good care of your bags when you need help or to check them in and I only paid a small price for being right around the corner from Louis Vuitton and Gucci every, single, day. I should take that back, I actually ended up losing 90% of my wallet contents inside LV since I saw it every day, day in and day out while I was there, but that's another story. I recommend this as a steps away place to Michigan Ave and a fantastically priced, well located, well amenitie'd hotel in the heart of Chicago.;4;3;1;2;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
697;3/27/2011;n71LT7RD8k0u7mGX3qKgiA;Y67p-eyoimult8npmwz0vA;The location was great and the rooms were fine:the bathroom was great in fact. In terms of customer service, however, it failed miserably for me and my students. I was there with 6 students of mine for a field trip to visit art museums. So as a group, we checked out 5 rooms. First of all, the hotel had a $75 authorization charge per night per room which I never had to deal with before, and it was something the hotel didn't inform us about when booking the room. For some of the students, depending on the bank, the funds will not be released for 3-5 business days. Problems: 1. When checking out, the bill that was slipped under the door noted that I had stayed there for one night (which was wrong since I had stayed there for two nights) and that I owed them for that night. Again, not true since the room was paid in full in advance. 2. The day after we arrive back home, a student of mine notifies me that her bank account had a $368 dollar charge from the hotel. First of all, it was only supposed to have been a $150 authorization. So when I called the hotel, I was informed that it was a mistake and they have no idea why the person checking her in did that. !!!?? How do you not know how to type in 150 and instead type in 368? So that is 200 dollars that this student won't have access to immediately, not to say she already had 150 dollars that she wouldn't have had access to. Pretty bad.;3;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
698;2/4/2012;74yi6pYGWJlWYDSx12KlTg;r7Wmm_v4aGK9xuZekUBqAQ;As with most http://Hotwire.com deals, we reserved a room and found out upon checking in that it was, indeed, a king-sized bed to be shared between four people. Aside from the cramped arrangements, the hotel was excellent. The hotel bar was expensive (as is anything in the Loop), and the ceilings were pretty low. My only other gripe was that the door to the bathroom was a sliding door, and left a rather large and awkward open space between the panel and the wall. Other than that, the room and hotel itself were very nice, and the location was excellent - right across the street from The Drake and footsteps from Michigan Avenue.;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

700;2/17/2009;hPcwoAJ7bts2ZzVgHbcdCg;FAxFj4HQChpKxF6KL0rMnA;This maybe the best hotel that I have ever visited, based on service.   First, we arrived about 3 hours before scheduled check-in and they let us into our room with no added fee.   Second, they had the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in.   Third, they had a huge shower with the rainfall spout. The room was a little small, but we were only there to sleep. Fourth, they had a couple very helpful concierges.  They made some great restaurant recommendations and were able to get us tickets to a show and give us bus/train information. Fifth, on our check-out day, we were up late the night before and got a late check-out, at no extra cost. Sixth, after our late check-out, they kept our bags at the hotel for six hours until our flight left, at no extra charge.   When it seems like some places nickel and dime you for everything, this place was a welcome relief.     Also, it is a great location, about a block from the Hancock Tower and Michigan Avenue.  If you are in town to shop, this is ground zero for upscale shops.;5;4;3;2;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
701;2/2/2010;ewe7mPdcZqN0c76cmw8L1A;AADT758x5G2bhwFBRDqLfA;Hotel Lobby Bar Project Review #8 - Martini Bar Drinking at the Knickerbocker lobby bar is like drinking in the company board room. It's not at all unpleasant but you feel like you're in that awkward little place between old-fashioned charm and new-fanged snazz. In other words, just kinda dumpy. My cohort astutely pointed out that the complimentary bar snack was the exact same cheesy pretzel mix that that have at our local VFW Hall. Plus or minus? You decide! The bartender may have been the best part of the bar. When we enquired as to what the large room was up on the mezzanine level he replied (in the friendliest way possible) that we were just looking it a series of mirrors meant to make the room look larger.  Nice trompe 'l'oeil, Knickerbocker. He was friendly, chatty and seemed slightly crestfallen when we asked for the check after only one round. Sorry Martini Bar, we have Chicago Fizzes to drink and toasted almonds to eat up the road. I think Knickerbocker might need to turn in for the evening. It's ok though, Diagnosis Murder is on followed by the evening news. Cheer up!;3;2;2;3;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
702;11/19/2006;RZBR-Vhh3Y6RkfzvuC06mQ;S-cs5LWNlKFqAmY327qSuQ;I stayed here during my visit from Boston in the early summer. My friends and I thought it looked good online and the location seemed good (well, coming from the Concierge). Watch the progression of my rating...(we'll start off with 5 stars to be fair) When we checked in, the front desk gave us a hard time about our online reservations and were quite rude. After arriving upon our room, we discovered that it was a smoking room, when we clearly requested a non-smoking room (my friend has really bad allergies). When we finally switched to another room, the view was crappy and was tiny (especially for four college girls with about two suitcases each :P) -4 stars However, the rooms were very nicely decorated and the pillows were ridiculously luxurious! +1 star Bathrooms were tiny:my closet back home is bigger (that's saying something!) For the four of us (where at least 20 minute prep time is needed before going out), this became *quite* a hassle. -2 stars We barely needed our rental car:we could walk everywhere! Location is very good, as everything was about 10 minutes away. +2 stars The restaurants in the surrounding area were yummy and we enjoyed ourselves immensely with all of the culinary delights and nightlife choices. +2 stars Parking is crazy expensive, especially when you're on a student budget like we were. Even if you parked at a nearby garage instead of having the hotel valet do it, everyday parking came to be pricey. That definitely put a dent on our spending for going out, shopping, etc. -2 stars The upstairs area and the lobby are gorgeous:chandeliers, velvet, gorgeous draping, etc. Very nice:imagine the effect it had on us the first time we stepped in! :) +1 stars So, all in all, 3 stars. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll probably try somewhere else.;3;3;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
703;9/30/2010;c-XVXhAk1iu3cQ5jmJIZ1w;4yiybZtqOAOkwO98rGSnUw;This hotel is getting 3 stars mainly because of the location. Because the customer service is nothing they should be proud of - that's for sure! The room was nice enough, clean and bright but very small, as were the beds. Our bathroom door did not shut properly which was fuckin' irritating. What I want to know is how you can say you have a martini bar with 50+ martinis and not make a cucumber martini? WTF! We stayed here four nights and it wasn't that bad. We got an OK deal on Priceline. But basically I would not CHOOSE this hotel to stay at again and the MAIN reason (HOTEL MANAGERS I HOPE YOU"RE LOOKING AT THIS) is because the check-in staff and front desk staff were incredibly rude, very disorganized and generally not appearing to be that interested in customer service. These people need MAJOR MAJOR training. I had to wait over 25 minutes for them to "find" a package which I stood there looking and pointing at the entire time. This was especially not cool because I told them immediately when I asked for the package that I pointed to, I needed to be in my cab outside to head to an event... which I was then late to.;3;2;1;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
704;5/6/2006;jL3o3TbS3ZYTi6ij;yfy3v_n7BWiGs6pTf58i6A;As the venue for our Law School Prom (yes, I did indeed say "PROM"), this hotel was very average. The ballroom was beautifully done and impressive with its high ceilings and flowery viney gilt doohickeys all over (I'm sure there's an architectural term for this of which I'm just wholly ignorant). Although the '80s-/'90s-/Miami-Vice-inspired light-up dance floor was slightly incongruous with these flowery viney ceiling and wall decorations, the light-up dance floor was definitely WAY awesome when the (horrifically outdated and spectacularly BAD) DJ played "Billie Jean," the highlight of my evening. Was the DJ that bad? Yes, he really was THAT bad. If I knew who he was, his review would make my Barnes & Noble review look like a feather floating in the wind. I did find it a little odd that the ballroom was a two-story setup such that there were twelve tables or so on the second floor, too. This seems like poor planning, and while it makes for a pretty room and more space for the hotel to rent out, it also makes for an inefficient means for the people seated up there to access the dance floor. ANYway, while the decor was generally pretty beautiful and slightly eclectic, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Granted, it was hotel food. I understand that. Unfortunately, it was reeeeeally bad hotel food. A three course meal (salad, entree, and dessert), the salad was the best of the three and that's mainly because it's probably really hard to mess up a basic salad as long as the greens are fresh. The chicken was bland and the deceptively rich-and-creamy-looking sauce was just that -- DECEIVING! The cheesecake (not on my list of favorite desserts in the first place) was oddly-textured. So disappointing. In the end, although the Drake would have apparently cost ~40% more for our tickets, I would happily have paid that amount because my experience with their food was in the past much more satisfying and the single-story layout is more conducive to cohesive group identity (i.e. being able to stumble onto the dance floor together without having to navigate any stairs).;3;4;1;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

I read some pretty horrible reviews about this place from some of the other hotel review sites out there though so I was a little nervous.   I've actually never had a bad experience from Priceline and this was no different.  For $60 or so, this place was great.  Perfect location, friendly staff, all the basics.  The room felt like it was out of the 60s with lots of dorky decor, but who cares, right?;4;2;2;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
706;2/7/2010;wqKGloz0olP1jNYEofR1fA;kyv0kf5489CW8inlNrSzNg;Went to the lobby bar with my cousin last night, around 1amish.  I was dressed up, and she was in her pajamas.  Was unimpressed with the round bar just sitting in the lobby, and very unimpressed with the menu that had $14 drinks.   That is when the very character-y bartender (stout black guy who has a lot to say and I approve) told me that his drinks were certainly worth it, and I'd be buzzed after one.  I have alcoholic genes, so I can drink most men under the table and never catch a buzz, but I digress. The one tasty, fruity martini got me beyond buzzed.  I was drunk.  So this yelp's to you, Mr. Bartender. I am only taking one star away because I still am unimpressed with the vibe.  But the bartender himself, gets 5 stars.  He even flirted with my shy cousin. AS FAR AS THE HOTEL ITSELF: I don't know what to say about it.  There was a swingers ball going on, and that was pretty exciting.  What kind of establishment is this?  Added to my "hotel bar" experience, in a cool kind of way.;4;4;3;3;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

The room was very small, but unless you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it is fine.  The bed was not as comfortable as I would have thought, but it was OK.  The rainfall shower was nice, but the pressure wasn't too strong (use the handheld attachment if you need to get shampoo out).

I got a pretty good deal on the room with a travel site, but given the price that it should have been...not worth the money. It was less than impressive, I've stayed in nicer hotels in Cleveland. But regardless, the main reason for my rating is that they have a ton of hidden fees, and on top of it all, they charged my credit card for items from the mini-bar that I did not take. When I called to ask if there may have been a mistake, I was simply told no and that I would be charged anyways. Moral of the story, I have a hard time giving this hotel anything but one star when they cant admit their mistakes, or they are just simply ripping people off on purpose. Either way, they will never get my business again.;1;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

Oh, the cold, cruel light of day!   When I return to Chicago, I probably will not have this place as my first choice, more like 2nd or 3rd choice if I will be staying close to the Miracle Mile area.;3;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
711;9/25/2011;tROZLovRC82BW3ikMGJZKg;HosSn1BrPCR_HGlpYuunYQ;I'll keep this one short-  decent hotel with a great location.  The prices are reasonable for a hotel right off the magnificent mile, and our room had been recently renovated, but was a bit on the small side.  The elevator was older and slow, but did the job.  The staff was friendly.  Its definitely worth considering again for a trip.;3;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
712;9/24/2011;Xr0Quo-f2NDe2AcmP7ftQw;3uJLBIQSjY2UfscuQhZGvw;I work kitty corner from this hotel, so I recommend that coworkers stay here when coming in from out of town. I haven't been in the rooms, but they say they are nice and clean and fine. I have found the loby bar a nice place to stop and get a drink with colleagues after work. Service was very friendly and responsive. Haven'd dined in the restaurant, but appetizers in the bar were delicious.;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
713;9/30/2010;KCj9XkO-bhEaklDf9QqA7Q;Zm41R3MIlWXc8iUfprMSMQ;My review is merely for the 11 hour period we were there between 10 pm and 9 am, but for what it's worth, those were good hours. We needed a rental car for the remainder of our trip, so we picked one up at O'Hare and made the drive here. Finding the hotel was pretty easy. The valet parking? I knew it was coming, and it was still painful. At least I didn't physically see the $53 charge till the next morning. The best part of this hotel, other than the clean, beautiful lines to it, is obviously the location. Just across from the Drake, you're incredibly close to so much that Chicago has to offer. Since we got there late, checking in was a breeze. We had purchased our room through Priceline and there were no problems. We were quickly sent out our way through the tiny elevators to the 9th floor, which had mostly a view of the buildings around it, but through one small opening, you could also see to the lake. Not that you can see much at 10 pm at night anyway, but I digress. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby. The added bonus to the whole 11 hour stay was the concierge who pointed us towards an excellent breakfast just a few quick blocks away at Feast. Head there for a meal if you're staying at the Knickerbocker. You won't be disappointed.;4;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
714;8/12/2010;PJLSabchRSVdAPbEZoxRmg;Z37fgYb4G74_aDZveSrP3g;It's been two years now and slowly....I'm becoming an expert on downtown Chicago hotels. That didn't sound right. Of utmost importance to me is noise & cleanliness, so I give this place a thumbs-up. The A/C is rather loud, which forces me to hit three stars instead of four -- but I must also add that the AC works quite well even so.   The breakfast buffet is better than most, and if you just want to take a couple of items to go (as I find to be most useful), they charge you very reasonable a la carte prices (well, as reasonable a hotel fare goes). Staff is courteous & helpful:service is prompt, and they have good in-room coffee for brewing.  I always consider that a plus as it enables me to be civil once I'm ready to go downstairs & use the biz center or get breakfast. If you want to get nitpicky, the gym doesn't have any floor mats. So what? It's clean and the equipment is modern and clean. The comfort, convenience and service make this a great bargain. I would book my boss here and he is WAY fussy about hotels. Check it out!;3;1;0;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
715;10/31/2011;MP39Op8JxNQ0hpQNncaVsQ;BIYDySs1Z8SO-dcmHjZPSw;Pros: Great location (50 feet from Michigan Avenue) Reasonable price (after using several web sites) Nice modern comfortable room Reasonably quiet Front desk and attendants were helpful and for the most part polite Good concierge advice (Giordano's and Gino's deep dish pizza are both within walking distance) If you love shopping: great shopping is blocks away. Cons: Internet was $10 per day One day we needed to use the internet from the "office". That was $20 per hour. If you have a car, parking is over $50 per day. There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away. This deserved 3 1/2 stars. What made me go with three stars was the memory of the day I had to use the internet downstairs and I ended up paying $20+ for the hour I used it. My next hotel had free internet in the lobby.;3;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
716;5/18/2011;dxDmAqoEAccPNzU;ecNRIlPjIVNKAGPEUxGXSA;This is a great hotel to stay in but beware, if you leave something behind you most likely won't see it again! I stayed here for a wok trip and had a blast. The hotel is very nice, concierge is extremely helpful, beds were comfy and the martini bar was delicious. However....and I know it's partly my fault but... I left a very expensive hair curler in the room to the left of the sink and 24 hours later when I called and realized I hadn't packed it, housekeeping said it was no where to be found! I swear to you I left it there, right in that spot, would bet my life on it and STILL, it's no where to be found by the staff. So I definitely recommend this place but don't leave anything behind!;3;0;0;8;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
717;5/4/2011;r4m-sLNwwBWrKOfkFu4JNg;wbDAM2qaWRdkuLNUbv7hPw;Pros: -Reasonably priced nightly rates -Modern, clean furnishings -Spacious rooms (at least our's was!) Cons: -$53/day + tip to park!! (tip: Drake Parking Garage across the street is $35/day, or there's a self-park garage a block past the hotel at 200 E. Walton that's $29/day) -Internet isn't complimentary ($10/day!! In this day and age where all hotels offer free WiFi, this just seems absurd!) -Horrible rain head in shower made it impossible to get soap out of thick hair! -Unfriendly front desk staff seemed like we were inconveniencing them to check in or ask a question Bottom line: Hotel is nice enough, but the 'hidden fees,' coupled with moody service, make it way overpriced for what you get.;3;0;0;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
718;9/29/2010;QUa8uqvVNRcIOjQ39rlaXw;nxlwBVBoqsKpHux-p6jqqw;I was at the Knickerbocker for my wedding and I can't sing enough praises of the staff. Each and every person we came in contact with was polite and helpful at every turn.  I couldn't have asked for a better evening. All of my guest were in awe of the beautiful space, delicious food, and 5 star service.  As were hubby and I. The champagne parade was a big hit.  We loved it! My husband was concerned that having our reception at such a luxe location would make him and his family/friends feel uncomfortable or out of place. I assured him otherwise and after 5 minutes of arriving at the cocktail hour he realized there was nothing to worry about.  Upon arriving we were greeted by a waiter and he had champagne in our hands almost instantly. Since there were only about 10 minutes left in the cocktail hour the waiters went out of their way to pick bride and groom out of the crowd so that we could get a taste of the delicous appetizers. Mm-mmmm the mini beef wellington...who knew such a small piece could be so flavorful. The only 'hiccup' occured when we got to Parlor G where the bridesmaids were scheduled to get hair and make-up only to find that many of the outlets in the room weren't working. This was definitely a problem with the hair dryers, curling irons, etc that needed to be plugged in. But about 5 minutes after placing a call to the front desk a maintenance staffer was at the room with extension cords and a power strip to get us by.  Also the internet access is like something out of the '90s...why not just charge it to the room? All in all I will definitely recommend the Knickerbocker to visiting guests or locals who want to get away.  We can't wait to return for our anniversary.;5;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
719;4/23/2009;1rdo3cek;tuYMK1U_uUtf8TgpJ0c9dQ;i've never stayed at the hotel but i did work with them to plan our med school Winter Formal. We got an awesome deal on catering and drinks and the staff was more than happy to have our group. The room where we were was amazing! The light up dancefloor gave it just what we needed to make the formal a huge success. they were more than accomodating and i would not hesitate to work with them again. my only complaint (and it was partly our fault because we got started late) was that they picked up dinner plates really quickly and some people were not done eating yet. other than that everything went off without a hitch!;4;2;2;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
720;10/28/2011;Bckuj79ACPGqrna0;fRGqrqWuKyrICwV0iQzN9g;They employee thieves as valets. The hotel itself is good, but if you valet your car with them, they assume that anything not bolted down is theirs for the taking. You want to stay at the hotel? Go for it, but if you think you're car is safe with their valets, you got another thing coming.;1;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
721;5/21/2010;-puMkS;qL8RwBOAwXJ5VSkR-DWl5g;The hotel is under construction. The elevators were crowded. The door staff ogled me every time I entered and left. The inside staff could have been more friendly, more helpful, and much better and pretending to be enthused about working in customer service.;2;1;1;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
722;1/26/2009;0ca-;FXWlQ19Y11B3t27YGkHfwg;We stayed here during our wedding weekend: 11.21.08-11.24.08. We had many questions in prepping for this stay, and our contact, Ann, always responded quickly and almost always with a happy result. Our suite was large, clean, and brand-new. The bedding was very comfortable, the whirlpool tub was great, and the TVs were awesome (although barely used). We appreciated the use of the steamer for my dress, the free internet and the tray of fruits and champagne. We enjoyed the carolers and extra Holiday cheer in the lobby. It was a shame that the renovations were not able to be completed, though it is beautiful all the same. And everyone was very friendly to us. And, of course, the location is unbeatable. The room was a lacking a few things, such as a hook tall enough for a wedding dress, good bathroom lighting and quiet ventilation. Also, a maid had left the door open when we left for over an hour (the deadbolt was engaged, so the door could not close). That could have ended very badly for us. Thankfully, all was fine, and they were able to compensate us satisfactorily for the scare, although it took some work to get to that point. We look forward to staying with you next year - hopefully, in warmer weather, so we can take advantage of the beach.;4;1;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
723;7/19/2007;4o;TOoMya2dG0AHCQUGqwu_bQ;What a run down dump.  A far cry from a 4 star hotel, although you can tell it has some history.  It's in desperate need of renovation.;2;0;0;1;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

727;9/29/2008;12tfEuDPvlQ1gZFsg-DapQ;4O6Yk-8miX5CAmU6EK--aA;I stayed here while on business.  Our room had been updated and was very comfortable although the lighting was horrible.  I understand the 'mood lighting' and don't mind it generally, but I draw the line at the bathroom.  You've got to brighten up the bathroom at least.  I couldn't see to put on make-up.  Annoying.   Everyone was super friendly and accommodating during our stay.  I didn't dine at the restaurants but I did feel the in room meal prices were too high.  We spent $55 on (2) egg breakfasts and a pot of coffee (after gratuity).  $55, Really?!  Are you kidding?;3;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
728;4/12/2011;-EmyMOefmqSP;jfpqJpSwQnL-6eblk7hIhQ;My elderly parents needed an ADA compliant room with two double beds. The room was elegant and accommodated them easily. The room was clean, quiet and the beds were "fresh" and luxurious. The door men were always ready to help them in and out of the car. Also, when they did not answer their phone the concierge personally went to their room to make them aware we were waiting for them. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch only. You don't need dinner because of all the restaurants within walking distance you will want to try from the Cheesecake Factory to The Rosebud Steak House, etc. The breakfast menu is simple and delicious and fairly priced. We had breakfast for $80 with tip for four adults. The omelets were perfectly made and the contents fresh and perfectly sautéed. The oatmeal, my favorite, was made well and that means it was freshly made with attention to detail. The bacon was well cooked, but not burnt as I asked. One note, basic single rooms have one king sized bed in a smaller room. If you need two double beds or a larger room there will be an up charge of about $30 or more per night. Parking approaches $60 plus tips for the door man so it is not recommended you stay here if you have a car to park. I made the reservation on Priceline and I saw no difference in how we were treated because of the discounted rate. The sales staff also has excellent email communication skills so you can get exactly what you need and confirmation emails to set you mind at ease.;3;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
729;5/20/2012;MrpWO7jhmZ8epKTqlzKnMg;LOi1qbpl2hTP0cwSDDuyBQ;This was our first stay at an Omni.  We booked this as part of a land air package via Travelocity. Located on the Magnificent Mile, it was a very nice stay.  We got a king one bedroom suite on the 20th floor.  Other folks in our group were on the 22nd and 25th (highest) floor respectively.  We had a view of the Trump from our window. Our bed was turned down every night.  Fresh linens replaced twice a day. You can request a courtesy refrigerator separate from the mini bar.   USA Today delivered daily. You enter from the street up to the hotel lobby on the third floor.  Then take another elevator to your room. There's a food cart with Starbucks coffee and breakfast items for sale.   You can print your boarding pass at no charge in the business center. Wi-Fi is available at $9.95 a day or free if you're a loyalty member.  Sign up for free to join the club.  I passed. Hubby worked out at the fitness center.   We also requested late checkout.  They gave us until 1:30 pm. I'd stay here again.;5;1;1;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
730;9/21/2012;0ZNF6CiFVGP7CTFVy17y0Q;F0l-K4GVtEdyyal1GKsRGw;Just recently returned from my three night stay here. We stayed in a King Suite on the 27 floor for around 480 a night. + The service from the staff was probably the best part of the stay at the Omni. The staff were extremely helpful and professional.  The turn down service was great as well. The room was a generous size. Complimentary wifi if you sign up for the select guest program, connectivity was great. - Our bathroom was extremely small. Two people could not get ready at the same time and the only other mirror to use to get ready was outside of the bathroom and above the bar. - The carpets were stained and our pillow cases had stains on them. - The decor was outdated. Overall, the stay at the Omni was disappointing. Considering the price we paid we would've paid a little extra and indulged in a more modern and trendy hotel.;3;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
731;5/15/2012;azwtNZAkybMkPYtiYf;DCnqvmdvbu04hTAv7DX-Mw;I came here for a stay over the weekend.  I have to say that the service was superb and the staff was all really nice.  They made our bed once in the morning and once at night.  The beds at Omni was also very comfortable, more comfortable than the bed that I slept at home.  The curtain was also thick and really good so it sheds out all the light.  They also had all the little stuff that made life a little bit better, such as liquid soap, shampoo, cotton balls, q-tips, sea salt for the bath tub, shampoo and conditioner, and lotion. The place smelled good.  TV also had cable, and I had wifi connection as well.  I had a good time at Omni and will be staying there again if I ever go back to Chicago.  Location for this hotel is also good because you are within walking distance in downtown Chicago so everything is a few blocks away.;5;3;2;3;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
732;3/10/2012;6IlVM5oXuh-bCRQSCZ3;g37Y_WmgPcJI9bf_kPV2Og;Babysitting again... got to enjoy a night sitting on my computer in front of the TV while the baby slept. Its not Peninsula or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel.  The layout of the room was a sitting room connected to a bedroom.  The bathroom was spacious and the living area included a wet bar and a desk.  The room was very clean and the housekeeping came down to turn down the room bringing milk and cookies - a very nice touch.;4;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
733;5/26/2012;gxiwj;o79k4DP4GmgWtl3QmUmpmg;Pros: 1) All suite hotel, great for kids, lots of space and two TV's.  Kids and parents could watch different TV shows. Fridge and microwave were put to good use with all of our leftovers. 2) Ordered room service twice and food was delivered very quickly. The burger is one of the best, if not THE best burger I've ever had. We ordered the burger twice during our stay. 3) EXCELLENT location. Walking distance to Giordano's, Gino's East, Rosebud Italian Restaurant, Water Tower Place, Navy Pier, Lakeshore, Apple Store, and John Hancock, and Eggsperience. 4) Really tasty coffee provided for free in room (2 cup coffee maker) 5) Housekeeping was excellent. They left extra toiletries, towels, creamer, coffee upon request. 6) Lots of drawer space for clothing. 7) Didn't get to use fitness center, but it looked nice and clean. TVs on cardio equipment. Cons: 1) Sink and shower wouldn't drain quickly enough. 2) Required to transfer elevators at lobby level to get up to rooms. From street, you take one elevator up to 3rd floor, then transfer to second set of elevators. 3) No Disney channel. (Nickolodeon available) 4) Bed comfort could be improved.;4;1;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
734;7/12/2011;9kqn8megNY3Tmyi1xB2qDQ;q2befPCMXcHMpRCS2NChWA;Join their select guest program, the benefits are real and significant unlike a lot of other places. Search and work for good rates.  Omni's prices are always going up and down.  I get the best luck when I call the hotel directly.  The website and toll free number are unyielding.  Great hotel, clean rooms, excellent location, great staff -very friendly, free room service coffee every morning for select guests.  Restaurant and bar are way over priced and I don't like the starbucks coffee they serve every day but I can overlook this.  I love starbucks and their specialty drinks but their ordinary coffee has always tasted a bit skunky to me.  Also the sliding doors for the bathrooms can't be locked.  If I weren't staying alone or shared a room on a business trip this would be awful. Thanks to Chicago's crappy zoning regulations, one thing that's really a shame and will change Omni forever is the Ritz-Carlton.  Ritz-Carlton is building a massive hotel just to the South of Omni.  I mean there may be 6 inches if that between these hotels and the Ritz extends just a about 4 feet closer to Michigan completely ruining the South view and corner room views Omni had on Michigan.  What were once top rate, top price rooms, are now the worst rooms in the hotel.  What a bummer.  Omni can't be happy. Still a great hotel that can be had a fair prices.  Thanks to the Ritz maybe even better prices.;4;2;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
735;8/6/2011;Qc-rI1MgkfdslTVsdo;gknmjr-3I0HFQX6o9d8Sqw;We took a large family trip to chicago and stayed at Omni in June. There were seven of us on this trip and we booked 3 rooms. Although we had three government ID's the hotel was only able to give us two rooms at the governemnt employee rate. They said this was due to the hotel being sold out and so there were no more discount rates avaliable? This did not make any sense. We stayed for 6 nights and 7 days. Never once was the room service the same. One night they would turn dow the bed all the way, the next just take the pillows off, the next they would hide the pillows in the closet.... It was weird. The hotel offers a Select Guest program, which we signed up for before even going to Chicago. When we got there the check-in staff did not mention it at all, we had to bring it up. With the beverage program, as a part of the select guest thing: I would mark for them to knock and bring in our drinks, but the only time it was brought in was the day that I ask for it to be left out..... so strange. The selecet guest program stated that the hotel had a pillow bar, you could pick a feather pillow or a foam pillow. We ask for feather but never got it. We ask a couple of times. The select guest program stated it included a nightly treat and a bottle of water, yet we never got either brought to the room. The internet did not work half the time and we needed the internet as we had to work while we were on vacation. Elevators were weird, you couldn't even take the stairs if you wanted to....who does that? The billing was really weird as well. They charged our credit card 1800 dollars when we checked in and then when we reviewed out billing statment when we were leaving we noticed that they charged us for the internet that we were told was free so they had to go back and credit us. Then it took about a week for the internet charges to be credited. This type of billing caused the fraud department on everyones credit cards to shut down the cards until we called to get things fixed ..... a hassel that could have been avoided had Omni charged per night or at the end of our stay. The location was nice, but we felt like we still had a long way to go for most things, other than shopping. Although this used to be the hotel that Oprah used, it looked more like something Jerry Springer would use. Overall it was just a plain old hotel. I would NEVER pay $219+ tax and fees to stay here again. I would have rather stayed at a Motel 6.;1;0;0;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
736;2/19/2011;e;EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA;Although the Omni is always a great choice, for some reason the bf felt like it would also be haunted. It wasn't. It was simply a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location in the heart of Chicago where you want to be if you're a first time visitor. Let me qualify this for a moment ... having been to Chicago several times for different occasions, I've come to discover that the whole Michigan Ave, Rush St, Lincoln Park thing is cool, but it's only a small part of what Chicago is really about. All those times I complained about having to go further than 2 miles from the area I was missing out on so much outside of what tourism has become of Chicago. One take on the Architecture Tour will show you all the other neighborhoods you're missing out on. Regardless, the Omni is nice, high class, great accommodations and very attentive staff. In most cities it's one of the best hotels and in Chicago it's no different although I make a convincing argument for some great boutiques I've had a chance to stay with. The restaurant has pretty good fares so room service would also be on par, but be prepared to pay a premium for having it in your room versus just coming downstairs, even if you're not dressed up.;4;2;1;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

Found a package for around $365 - not bad for a Friday night stay in the heart of the Mag Mile that included overnight parking AND $50 worth of breakfast. Check in - fast and smooth. Kids received a little Welcome Backpack thingie with little toys and a snack in it. Later that evening - cookies and milk were delivered to our room for the kids.

738;10/3/2011;J0IkN5PwtsfmBFzUSNMekw;THVA0yBdlQfW_R2jKaLkvA;Alright, I've stayed here a few times. Here is what's going on at this swank joint on the Mag Mile: I'm going to say I do NOT recommend making this reservation via Priceline or Travelocity or a site of the type. You will end up getting their "Studio" room which isn't really given in ANY of the room descriptions (as it different GREATLY from the regular one rooms that others will get. I learned this my first time staying. Needless to say, I was not happy that I wasn't getting the room type I had asked for. I spoke with their CS Rep online and wasn't given any remedy to make it right. Worst customer service call experience I ever had. Finally, the hotel manager offered a consolation to the misunderstanding. Before you book, also, make sure you save up for their Guest Rewards Programn, which entitles you to several freebies. The rooms are SWANKY! Very nice indeed. Modern furniture and the bed will make you just want to sink in it and never get up. Heck, you even get ROBES! The restaurant they have there is nice. Nice decor, decent food....but pricey. But hey, let's face it, if you're staying here, you're obviously not broke. Hotel staff is generally very helpful in anything you need, so don't be afraid to ask them. I had all my requests taken care of. It's prime location for all your shopping needs. My SO (Significant Other) was pleased with the location and was poised to make this spot for our stay as it is so close to so many retail stores. Downers about this place? The access to the lobby and elevators. They are on the 2nd floor which requires an elevator to get to. It's weird. Also, I'd like better customer service. Mine wasn't bad....but I've had better. I'm paying good money for this hotel so I'd expect excellent customer service.;3;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

You really can't go wrong staying at any Omni, just this was especially nice due to the service and location.   Located on Michigan Avenue, your close to shopping and tons of restaurants. The rooms have a full-sized living room with flat screen, desk and wet bar area. The french doors lead to the bedroom with another TV, and the bathroom is very modern stocked with premium bath products. For work or pleasure, it's a great stay.;4;1;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
741;2/29/2008;hhYjsGkrQBDsknirFEkohg;HYh0bX4pYtHIUoUndWIIew;Absolutely amazing property. My room is so beautiful, and the whole hotel is so luxe! Coming in late last night, with the snow falling, was magical. More to come!!;5;8;10;5;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
742;4/24/2007;BMku5LXxVQS6Onx5yswjxA;NyltIuiXtKMuqtVH85uyxQ;It may not have the same celebrity rep as the "Peninz" down the street but this hotel is fantabulastic!  It's clean, trendy (but not TOO trendy)and the rooms are a cute suite-style with a separate "sitting/pullout couch" area.  A major star for location - right on Michigan Ave in the Magnificent Mile Zone. My favorite part of the Omni is it's lounge - it's a swank but comfy bar on the 4th level.  The lounge looks over Michigan Ave so you can check out all that hustle and bustle while you cocktail!  Totally reminds me of why I like drinking in hotel bars - guess I will have to go on a new party circuit ASAP.;5;5;5;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
743;1/2/2011;kZnburzL-kns2XzWG0fywA;wRIE02C12BTZPxN5heZU1w;Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways, fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni. Location was great but there are a lot of other options. If you get a really good deal on the room, I wouldn't say no.;2;1;1;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
744;4/28/2006;EQBRf0Ijylywko-NNY3vwg;rmI7czP4-6aqLU-odBL9fw;The Omni is spectacular. My husband and I had our wedding ceremony, reception, and post-wedding breakfast here, and couldn't have been happier. Rooms are very elegant and cozy but are "suites" (tiny sitting room) which seems very posh. More importantly, the service here is impeccable. Claire, our wedding coordinator at the Omni, did such a great job. One great thing about the Omni, as compared to other hotels in the area, is that the lobby is on the second level so there's not as much traffic from tourists.;5;4;1;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
745;8/18/2009;FqzFDYR4edyQ;ZUg7_Sorbqmkz7Gw7yk00w;How cool is it that every room is a suite? I love it.   Pros: 1. absolutely beautiful hotel 2. in downtown, right on the strip so everything was easily accessible 3. there is a walgreens right across the street - perfect for buying some water and snacks 4. the concierge. gotta give it up for my man marcus. so incredibly friendly, so incredibly knowledgeable 5. the staff overall was incredibly friendly, and not in a pretentious fake way 6. the restaurant 676 serves pretty decent food 7. there is a starbucks cart right in the lobby! (but it's not free, boo) cons: 1. kind of a weird floor plan. you walk in, you take the elevator up to the 3rd floor (where the main lobby is), and then from there you can take an elevator up to your rooms. why not just have an elevator on the street that accesses rooms using room keys? 2. this really isn't a con, but i found this to be perplexing. the bathroom is huge. and there is only one tiny trash can, and it's against the far wall by the toilet. i would move the trash can so it would be more central, and every day, house keeping would move it back by the toilet. 3. the mini fridge is kind of small.  thankfully i'm the master of rearranging fridges to make things, like my cupcakes from more and my leftover gino's east pizza, fit in there. I had a great time at the Omni. It wasn't the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed in (one had a pillow "menu" so you can ask for pillows you like), but it was very pleasant.  Kudos to the staff, you made the stay very enjoyable.;4;3;2;4;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
746;6/14/2007;gV3JBaTuFfYANkXWm7ZMsw;nShq32BVmWcDvLVz6EDbkw;Full disclosure: I haven't actually slept in this hotel. I have, however, visited friends staying here, and let me tell you, this place is pretty dang swank. It trends toward new-money opulence--modern but luxe (I'm thinking of this in comparison to, say, the SF Fairmont, which feels like walking into Buckingham bloody Palace). My pals managed to get a suite with two double beds they seemed to love, plus deluxe bathroom, and separate parlor, which is awesome and, apparently, standard. Genius. Combined with great location--right on the Mag Mile!--it would make for a super shopping weekend or even a nice base of operations for any of the many summer festivals and events. Also, you needn't fear shoddy cleanup service. Housekeeping is very diligent. When my friends decided they'd rather stay in and skip the housekeeping, the response was: "What? You don't want housekeeping?! Okaaay..." It's a lot funnier spoken aloud, promise.;4;2;2;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
747;9/1/2009;1yquPVPcsaL-hzYDdlBwBg;Yrqtb4jaJvYsZ3qFqn4XBA;My review deals only with the restaurant in the hotel. I stopped here with a friend who wanted to visit the hotel that sponsors Oprah. The restaurant was quite attractive, informal but with an upscale atmosphere. The menu selection was good but I expected more from such a supposedly outstanding Hotel and restaurant. The dessert selection, my highest interest, was also lacking in variety. No doubt it was good. But it wasn't that creative and not one of my "favorite things". The service was great, the staff pleasant and the views from the windows were great. It was a good time. I'm not sure Oprah, given her status, would dine here. But she probably thought it good enough for her audience. :-);3;1;1;1;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
748;12/30/2010;52bMFyG9Ur6sBofETgQV7A;HwcqzCJ1tc4GbE2T4bmk6w;The Omni Chicago is a great place to stay on business trips. It's centrally located to everything important-- Navy Pier, John Hancock, Millennium Park, etc. The lobby of the hotel is actually on the 3rd floor which is somewhat weird, you also have to take the elevator from the 1st floor and transfer on the 3rd to get to your room (for security i suppose). I would suggest upgrading to a room with a "City View" as the standard rooms all face surrounding buildings and you'll feel like you're in a prison block. The suites also have a couple large TVs (over 40 inches maybe?). Since I'm an unapologetic snob at times, I greatly appreciated the old fashion turn down service (for those of us who are too lazy to pull back our own bed covers and lay out our own robe before bed). The only con would be the Valet Parking which is about $50/day, but that's more of a Chicago problem and not necessarily that of the Omni.;4;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
749;7/6/2011;6yo5s0skeLJAc5UID3AMjw;r5uF9SZbBgJ_XTfBvX2Iow;I stayed at the Omni Hotel and had a problem.  Why the 5 star review?  Read on.   I chose to stay at the Omni Hotel on an overnight layover after returning from a month in Europe.  I chose this location so I could take my teenage son out for some Chicago style pizza because, unlike me, he had never been before.  The check in process and staff were awesome, we were greeted with a smile and they made sure to take very good care of us right down to leaving chocolate chip cookies and milk outside the door for my son,complimentary water, etc.  Great start!  Our suite was well appointed and very comfortable.   In keeping with our "plan" we picked up a pizza and stored it in the refrigerator to take back to the west coast the next day.  The following morning we left our room for a little sightseeing before we left.  Upon return to our room we discovered the housekeeping staff had thrown out our pizza.  I contacted the front desk and they apologized and offered a credit at their on site restaurant but we had already had reservations at another restaurant and this didn't really replace the item that was disposed of.  We left a little disappointed and I wondered why they didn't just replace the pizza as the pizza place (Giordano's) was literally just around the corner.  I arrive home and within a day or two I receive an email survey from Omni hotels.  In the survey I describe the situation.  Within 2 days I get another email from the Omni hotel with their apologies and an offer to ship a replacement out to me in California via FedEx overnight for the Giordano's pizza that was thrown out! That is great customer service!   Every business should be run this way, when there is a problem they fix it.  They have definitely earned my future business!;5;1;2;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
750;10/26/2010;Szg8ASkuYTgTJgQzZf67BQ;77nx6WwlORdESRd462igZA;We're Chicago suburbanites but decided to stay overnight one weekend after snagging a fairly decent deal on Priceline.  Omni is literally right on Michigan Avenue (although it's probably better if you get a room that doesn't face Michigan Avenue for noise reduction).  Very ideally located if you intend to shop on the Mag Mile. It's a beautiful hotel, although the lobby/reception is technically on the 3rd floor so you have to take 2 elevators to get to your hotel room.  Not a biggie but during busy times, you'll wait a long time for an elevator.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated and very clean.  No bed bugs issues either!  LOL.  Bed was pretty comfortable.  Bath amenities are nothing to write home about, but it is a clean, decent bathroom.   We had room 1118, and it is a bit of a bizarre L-shaped room.  Didn't really seem like a suite to me, and the bed didn't seem separate from the living area space.  it wasn't a huge room as some other reviewers reported and we only had one flat screen TV, so maybe we didn't get a true suite.  But it is still a nice room.  hey have a nice turn-down service, too.  But maybe we got 1118 because that's the Priceline special. Only two complaints I have are these:  (1) Parking (valet) costs $49.  There goes the bargain we got on Priceline. (2) The bed in 1118 shares the same wall as the bathroom in the next room.  So whenever the people in the next room go to the bathroom or turn on their shower, that noise blares in your ear.  Loud as hell.  Every time they ran their shower or used the toilet, we heard them.  Also, there is a hell of a lot of door slamming.  Too bad they can't do something to soften the sound of the door.;4;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
751;6/4/2010;fW3seT2O9-U4pDG8mjvo5g;wmDVtRuA_JgkEnPjYXhVbw;I booked a 4 night, through the weekend, stay for my mother who was visiting from out of town. I know the area well and the hotel is definitely centrally located, walking distance to John Hancock, great stores and dining, and Millennium Park. It also appealed to me because all rooms are suites (which I assumed meant spacious) and the hotel has a pool. They assigned her a room on the 12th floor which had a horrific view of the building next door. Had I known it would be THAT bad, I would have definitely paid the extra $30 to get the room with a city view. I'm talking seal the window with bricks bad view. The living room area did not have a sofa but instead two armchairs, one of which did not have an accompanying ottoman. Website pictures made it look large and spacious but in reality that was not the case. Bedroom area was really good with enormous comfortable bed. Amenities: -Pool area was mediocre and filled with children when I went to take a look. -Also, the hotel has a complimentary car that guests can book during weekday business hours. A car was booked to take my mom to brunch - it was running late and she had to stand waiting with a friend on the ground floor area which had no seating. Her friend asked if they could just call them when the cab arrived while they waited in the seating area on the 3rd floor lobby. Hotel staff said they could not and admitted other guests had requested this service in the past. If the car booked is running late (fault of hotel) then it seems this is not too much to ask? All in all, I expected this hotel to be a great experience for my mom but was let down. Being the great mom that she is, she had no complaints, but I have a feeling if it were on her tab she would have had plenty :);2;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

The accomodations were all first class and the king size bed was super comfy. Also had a great view of the Hancock building from the room on the 20th floor. Location of hotel is very convinient off Michigan Avenue with a ton of stores to go out shopping and do a lot of sight seeing. Also before my stay here I enrolled in their Select Guest membership. With that I was able to get free Wi-Fi in my room, 2 complimentary beverages every morning, and free Chicago Tribune newspaper. Will stay here again if I'm ever in Chicago.

I forgot to put the thing on the door one night until after 2am (yes i was out partying late!! :)). No goodies. The 3rd night i forgot to put the delivery time (no goodies again).  The staff was friendly but in that very vague robotic customer service way.  The pool was great.

761;12/11/2010;RIQxs3;MInp33w5vvHeBo68BAPmgw;The Omni is geared toward business clientele.  It's all meat and potatoes, and very squared away.  Service is impeccable.  I was particularly needy when I discovered that I had lost my driver's license immediately after checkout.  Three staffers checked everything, including the cleaning people who by then had moved on from my room to another floor.  One evening, we had martinis in the onsite resto 676, which proved sophisticated and fun. On the down side, I would have been happier if our suite was not looking directly into new construction, or if the check-in people had alerted us to this detail.  But good for you, Omni, for finding great real estate right on the Miracle Mile.  It was a confortable two day stay, but as a leisure traveller, I will venture out to another property when I get back to Chicago.;3;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

763;3/6/2011;vYEamwOuptmiAW3wCB4jhA;qa0NC1gfvEIawNY12dJG5g;Very disappointing price/value ratio. Have stayed at Westin River North numerous times and chose Omni expecting even greater luxury and service proportionate to the significantly higher cost. Room was nice but no more special. Internet access was additional $10 per day. We requested a room with a view which they honored but the windows were high on the wall and the view was, well, Michigan Avenue.  Business Center computers were $16 per 15 minutes. Staff was very professional and bar was nice. But overall we didn't have the 4-diamond experience we expected. We will return next time to the Westin and know that we will have a very luxurious stay.  And our view will likely be over the river, Michigan Avenue and Chicago City Center.

First night we were awaken by the burning stench of ammonia. The cleaning person and engineer quickly found the cause, the refrigerator had a leak and fixed it! They charge $10 a day for wifi! Really makes no sense to charge for wifi in this day and age! however sign up for their rewards program and its free. Finally we decided that we were going to return to Chicago a few days after we checked out and thought we might as well stay at the omni, however even though we stayed there five nights and paid well over $1,000 they still would only give us the rack rate of $285 on a Saturday night.

We only stayed one night so we didn't encounter the housekeeping staff at all.  Our room was clean and modern, so no complaints there at all.  Valet parking was quick and easy and the hotel was located close to everything we came into the city for.  For the price and location, we'd definitely stay at Hotel 71 again.;5;1;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
772;4/15/2012;UsbGD5IsBYksJUtXwVpihA;7t-rkbaAItmAyFDeLEI2Fg;The location is prime. That's one of the biggest things you look for in a hotel when visiting a city for the first time. If you have never been to Chicago & are unsure of what area to stay in (as I was), don't worry, just go with Hotel 71. It is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. If you go right, you'll hit Millennium Park in 5 minutes. If you go left, you'll hit the start of The Magnificent Mile in about 5 minutes. The further down Michigan you walk, the more upscale the shops become. So yes, the location is prime. However, there are still some negative points worth noting. We stayed in room 2414:it is a corner room with magnificent views. It was also very cold, being as it is April. We blasted our heater full blast, but for the life of us, we could not get warm. I was beginning to think something was wrong with US, until I called the front desk to have someone take a look at our TV because it wasn't turning on. When the repairman came, he fixed the TV and I told him about our heater. Well, he fixed the heater, but then the cold air wouldn't work. Why do we need the cold air after I was just saying how cold we were? Well, we had the corner room with magnificent views, right? Which meant, windows around 3/4 of the room. Although it was cold and windy out, the sun was still shining, so when we would come back to our room in the afternoon, IT WAS BAKING HOT. The windows do not open out (& rightly so, as it is the 24th floor), but with the AC not working either, we had to close the curtains for some relief, which sucked because we did have such a beautiful view. There is a mini fridge under the TV. Perfect for keeping our water cold. It came in handy, too, for our leftover deep dish pizza. But when I called room service to ask for a set of utensils, they refused, saying that they can only bring me utensils if I ordered room service. Well then, why did you give me a damn fridge in the first place? I suggest that any hotel that gives you a fridge in your room should be willing to heat up your leftovers & supply you with utensils. It only makes sense, does it not? Valet is $49 a night. I didn't rent a car, so this didn't bother me, but still, that's a lot, City prices, I guess. What was annoying about checking in though was the nightly incidental charge. I prepaid through Expedia and then called the hotel directly to ask if they required a deposit for incidentals. They told me no. I specifically asked and again they said NO. Upon check in, the front desk tells me there is a deposit of $220, which came out to something like $70 a night. He tells me he cannot take cash for it, it must be put on a credit card. This was incredibly annoying because I did not account for an extra $220 in my travel budget. The clerk kept calling it a "hold" but come on friend, let's call it what it is - a fully refundable deposit, granted you do not order room service. Unless you want a fork, in which case you'd have to order room service. Blah. And how come the doorman doesn't open the door??? This is the ONLY hotel I have stayed in where the doorman doesn't open the door. If I have to open my own door, it's because there is NO DOORMAN. They don't even say HI or WELCOME BACK whenever we came back to the hotel. Maybe Hotel 71 should stop by a Kimpton hotel & see how they do things. There's one across the street... But location is prime & the views were magnificent. Free wi-fi, although it was spotty & only seemed to work in the bathroom, but we learn how to pick our battles, I guess..;4;3;0;2;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
773;3/16/2012;OWLrykonNJeS739mg5SJuw;sFMhJk36ZH5aB7K5rO72lg;A fabulous boutique hotel with unbelievable views and amazing location! My family and I stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend because we had a wedding to attend down the street. A bit pricey, but since almost every room was literally booked downtown that weekend, we decided to go for it.  It was a great decision mostly because we didn't have to drive back and forth between the burbs and city, and the fact that we felt super fancy having an awesome view of the river and Trump Tower. The hotel staff were all very accommodating, and really made us feel welcome. I would wholeheartedly recommend Hotel 71 to anyone that needs a temporary home in our beautiful city!;5;2;2;2;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Causing havoc for new arrival guests.  Fitness Center was filled with water buckets.  Hotel staff is not attentive. Front desk concierge blatantly rude when you ask for city directions. You need to figure your own way around town. Don't expect recommendations or directions from the hotel staff. Hotel housekeeping keeps room service trays in hallways for a full day before pick up causing the hall to smell.  Bellhop staff not helpful. Toiletries are not refreshed unless you specifically ask. Toilet water pressure is extremely low. After a two weeks business stay with no other options, I was glad to check out of the hotel.;2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

777;1/20/2012;Hd9HfB4TmPEOYbjq26fnAA;q2OtkN-2BuJWjRbbdqhU3A;We chose Hotel 71 as basecamp for our wedding this past October.  We also had our rehearsal dinner there. First things first, the rooms were very affordable for downtown and were so nice.  Depending on what side of the building you were on (hopefully river side) the views were absolutely amazing!  The beds were plush and comfy, the tub in the bathroom was divine (although this may be only in the suite, not sure) and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality considering the price we paid.  Plus the location is perfect!  It's right on the river, across from the Trump Tower...easy walking to a lot of the loop and near north attractions.  Our guests loved it!   I worked with several people during booking, all of whom were so polite and helpful.  We were actually in one of their suites for the weekend, we used it to get all the girls ready for the reception in and it was plenty big enough.  After the fact we decided to stay an extra night, fully intending to move to one of the regular rooms, but they told us to just stay put in the suite at no extra charge. How nice! The restaurant attached, Hoyt's, is pretty good.  They have a really great mac & cheese with bacon and truffle oil (yum!)  And as a bonus, the bar is open till 2am - which was nice for the wedding party :) We also had the rehearsal dinner here.  I worked with their catering manager, Rebecca, during the whole planning process and she was just wonderful.  She bore with me as I planned remotely, sending runners in to check out the space, and working with me to make the menu exactly what I wanted.  We originally had planned to have it on the 6th floor in one of their newly renovated spaces (which are very nice).  A few days before the event I got a call from her saying that the ballroom space was open and would we like to upgrade...no charge.  The views from the ballroom were absolutely amazing and it made for an unforgettable dinner with all the people who are closest to us! We had an absolutely amazing experience at Hotel 71.  The rooms themselves, the view and especially the service were above and beyond what I could have expected.  I'll never stay at another downtown hotel if I can help it!;5;1;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
778;11/27/2011;tJouugKTWYsW;c7_xsZYNs-_G6IceEW2WoA;Love, love, LOVE this hotel. When traveling to large cities for tradeshows, I'm pretty much expecting higher hotel prices. Still $230/night for what I got was a great deal. Plus, it was on the shuttle route to McCormick Place. The regular rooms were booked and since it was getting close to show time, I upgraded to the junior executive suite for only $20 more a night than the regular room. Couple that with a 20% discount for pre-paying and it was a pretty good deal. Posh interior, working elevators with low wait times and generally really nice looking. The suite had a wet bar and fridge, very nice lounge/desk area, huge sleeping area with chaise lounge and a phenomenal bathroom. Garden tub + seperate shower with rain head - LOVED it. Hotel 71 is close to EVERYTHING. Seriously, the best location. The river is across the street, the Tribune building just to the right and fantastic architecture all around. Nice little restaurant/bar extended off the lobby and an array of food/drink choices all around. The staff was super friendly and my room was fantastic. I will say I can see how others reviewers may be irritated with the thermostat - I had it set on cool for the most part but I'm pretty sure it stayed the same temperature the entire time. It was comfortable for me, but I can how others might find it a bit stuffy. The business center was a little on the small side, but had everything I needed and everything worked.   I'd definitely recommend this place for business or pleasure and will for stay again the next time I'm downtown.;4;3;1;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Let's start with the bad though. I know parking in Chicago sucks, but 45$ a night? Felt like I was just throwing money away. Now the great...got a room on the 37th floor with a river view - spectacular. Great river view-decent northward view - see pics. The location is also great - near the Loop, River North and Mich. Ave. 4 Blocks to Art Institute. The morning noise was pretty bad starting at about 8am. LOUD shuddering construction going on somewhere across the hall. nOt good but we left each day by 10am so not intolerable. Room was $184 a night.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

We took advantage of the Groupon offer ($110 a night for a standard 2-queen bed room). The service was fast AND friendly. The location was amazing. The room was HUGEE (for comparison, it was about the same size or even slightly bigger than our 1 bedroom suite at the Intercontinental Chicago). The furnishing was relatively nice too, MUCH better than I anticipated (no ugly yellow checker-board pattern to my delight!) The only minus that prevents this from getting a 5 star is the horribly worn out bathroom. Our room was pleasant, but our bathroom was not. It's extremely old and worn out. Pro: VERY spacious room. You would not find a room this big ANYWHERE in Chicago for this price point. Con: Furnishing may not be up-to-par with other boutique hotels, but I personally think that the very spacious room easily makes up for that. It really comes down to decor VS. space. You could either choose another boutique hotel with amazing decor but small space or Hotel 71 with lots of space and a nice, but not amazing, decor.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

I'm really picky particularly about the A/C issue I've read about... our room has afternoon facing sun and Voila, A/C worked perfectly keeping us at 68 degrees even though it was moderately hot and humid outside.. The gym facility was pretty good too... we worked out at 1PM so was empty, but can imagine prime time can get crowded, but it was good for us... No restaurant in hotel per se, kinda a bar style place, but wife is from Chicago so we drove to Andersonville and had great breakfast up there.. I don't know what they are using for their beds, but we slept fabulously and that is so important... comfy and supportive... The room is very spacious and the bathroom is huge with his/her sinks so no bumping into each other a large tub and separate shower. Bathroom beautifully done in beige/peachy colored marble - nice! That said, I think we paid adt'l $20 for the renovated bathroom :-( Location right on the river, between Michigan and Wabash so shopping and restaurants are nearby... easy to get to, near Lakeshore..

The price wasn't too bad ($200) considering we were right downtown Chicago, within walking distance of Michigan Ave, the river, and Millennium Park.  What a great night.;5;6;6;1;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
784;5/27/2010;5O5lmD-bwjIYLaj4msH9;EvXwnFVVYVWPMIT-7AyKZg;Yeesh....did not have the best experience with this place.   We kept talking about all those things we needed to do before the wedding, and finding a nice hotel for the night of was one we kept forgetting about.  A Groupon popped up a couple of months before for Hotel 71.  Sounded nice enough for a fine downtown hotel price, so we bought it. The Groupon advised that we not call until the next day to book it.  Fine.  I called around 9:30.  The woman who answered was very rude and already flustered sounding.  So far we weren't off to a good start.   Then about a week later I have a charge on my credit card from Hotel 71 for $250!  In a panic I call and find out the woman had booked my date incorrectly and we were charged the no show fee.  With barely an apology it was refunded - which as everyone knows takes a few days to clear back onto your card.  Lovely when you're paying vendors left and right for wedding stuff.   The week before I called to verify we actually still had a room and we did, so so far so good I suppose. Day of wedding we arrive exhausted around 10:45p.  The front desk staff were super duper friendly and even went out of their way to go find a cork screw for us to open our bottle of wine the caterer had stashed away for us to take!   The room itself was eew.  Leopard print chaise lounge you didn't want to touch.  I didn't sleep a wink that night the bed was so uncomfortable - and considering how exhausted from the whole week of events leading up to the wedding, this was BAD.  I ended up watching the sun come up through the windows of the buildings across the river.  It was bad.   Again though, the staff was super sweet and friendly when we left!  The one redeeming quality about this place were the kind ones working - except for the icky woman on the phone. For our out of town guests that come in through the year I won't recommend this place, unless they can sleep like a rock on anything and don't mind paying a pretty penny for it!;2;6;1;2;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Anyways. Besides the stupid parking fees, I was pleasantly pleased with this hotel. For the price it's actually pretty great. We upgraded  (for 50 bucks) to a megasuite which is about 5 times bigger than my San Francisco apartment. It had three flat panel TV's, one of which was in the bathroom. Classy. Make sure you get one of the renovated rooms. They're pretty. I'd stay here again, just not in the middle of winter when the temperature is oh 10 degrees.

786;2/23/2007;jh5US9ejNvy1T;eydaYzZbJ-2cLcEDA5d5hQ;I stayed here on my recent trip to Chicago based on the recommendations on several yelpers when I asked for a modestly priced boutique-style hotel in a good location. Things that I liked: * Check in took like 4 seconds.  I hate it when the person checking you into the hotel spends like 5 minutes pecking at their computer and making faces to try and check me in.  This was the way it's supposed to be.   * Large room.  Lots of space to spread out and a large window bringing in lots of natural light. * Location.  I had several meetings around Chicago, and because the weather was nice, I was able to comfortably walk to just about everywhere from here. Things that could have been better: * No one serviced my room during the day until it was too late and I was back to my room late in the day.  No biggie, for me, but a bit surprising. * I had to ask 3 times to get a smaller pillow.  They set me up with these gigantic pillows (who sleeps on those?) and I requested a smaller one for my 2nd night but it was like pulling teeth to get it. * They tried to overcharge me when I checked out.  Probably an honest mistake, but if I hadn't looked at my bill, it would have set me back an extra 50 bucks.;3;4;1;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

788;10/8/2009;yLc3sSNvK6kghzqgaAdc9g;rkycWb53TaYk27F1POlsww;I'm not picky about hotels/motels--I've seen my share of holes punched through walls, leaky ceilings, the creative use of duct tape on a front door to make one feel especially secure at night--so when we were planning a trip to Chicago, I was happy to look in the HoJo/Travelodge/maybe-questionable-but-cheap range. And then my sweetheart found some kind of crazy Internet deal for three of us to stay at Hotel 71 for about $80-$90, making my mind boggle when I saw on their Web site that the going range is somewhere in the $200-$250s. Yay. It's huge and modern and the lobby helps you instantly forget the grody motels of travels past--there's art here! And a fireplace! And people at the desk smiling at you, waiting to help! We didn't have any of the mentioned problems re: lackluster desk attendants or elevator slowness, and we were charmed by the size of our room (you could do several cartwheels in both the room and the bathroom!--it was a corner room. Maybe that helped?), quality of the beds, and view. And they have room service that delightfully includes bread pudding ($5!) and sundaes ($6!) that we never got around to ordering. But just knowing it was down there if we wanted it made me sleep a little more sweetly. While there were a few minor bummers (no vent in the bathroom (three people taking showers in quick succession makes things awful steamy), $43 a night valet parking (I know it's the going rate but it bums me out all the same) ), the location and view and overall niceness of the place/lack of duct tape more than made up for it.;4;2;1;2;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
789;10/16/2007;zipwJCenJjkDrLyMceA3nQ;WJnyWEe_YK7JO47fcovBVw;This is an oddly mismatched kind of place...many things going for it....and several...well...not so much!   Location: Absolutely Great!  In the Loop at the lower end of Michigan Ave., all the good stuff downtown Chicago has to offer is close by.   The hotel is trying to be an upscale boutique hotel. About half the rooms have been renovated and about half have not.  The rooms are spacious in size, though maybe a little weirdly laid out.  I had a renovated room, which was trying to aspire to the more upscale hotels  but fell short in a few areas.   There is a 32 inch Plasma TV...and a glassed in shower with another TV in the bathroom.  The desk is weirdly tall compared to the chairs if you want to work in the room as I did.   The staff was mostly very helpful, particularly the room service people and the meeting & event people, though the front desk people (although pleasant) seemed a bit clueless about the issues that people had to deal with while I was there.   The biggest issue for me (a business traveler) was that the internet in the guest rooms was down for 5 of the 6 days I was there!  A major inconvenience!  I was amazed that it wasn't fixed within 24 hours.   One of the 4 elevators didn't work the whole time I was there, and the restaurant was closed for renovation, so later guests will hopefully avoid these issues.  Also the doorbell on our room went off for no apparent reason at 4:45 AM several of the nights we were there.  I did see that some people who reviewed complained about noise...Our room was nice and quiet, except for the aforementioned doorbell, which appeared to be an electrical problem, not a prankster. For meetings or events, the Penthouse on the 39th floor is absolutely awesome!!!  I held an event there and it was a great venue, and the staff very helpful.   Overall...a good place to stay....if a little random :);3;2;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
790;10/17/2007;qpu7H19ZMh1ARW2cnNMohg;UhYYT7VPI_K5O3JJ06UZog;My husband and I stayed at this hotel last week. Overall, this hotel was just ok.  I give it three starts because it did the job, but I probably wouldn't stay there again when I go back to Chicago. The room was big, it is in a great location, the view was nice, there were plenty of pillows, a spacious bathroom, and the staff was very friendly. What I wasn't too crazy about was of course, like most reviewers mentioned, the elevator.  I mean, come on!!!  There are two sets of two elevators:one set for the bottom half of the hotel and the other of course, for the top half.  You'd think that this would help the situation, but it actually didn't.  I mean, one of our two elevators was out of service the entire time we were there.  Between pressing the button to call for the elevator and getting off at whatever floor we wanted took literally about 8-10 minutes each time!!!  Holy crap, invest some money and get those things fixed.  Did I mention that each elevator can only hold 7-8 people WITHOUT luggage??? Ok, that said, there were just a couple other things that I would have liked different.  For example, they had a coffee maker in the room and gave us coffee packets but no sugar or cream, not even powdered.  The shower had absolutely no water pressure, so it took forever to wash the shampoo out of my hair.  And the hallways were really dismal and depressing looking.  There is also a huge gap between the room door and the hallway, so you might want to put a towel or something down to block out some of the voices, because you can hear every word spoken. I was also disappointed that there was no restaurant/bar in the lobby.  It is actually being renovated, but I knew that before we went on the trip by reading yelp reviews.  :)  They made up for it however, by rolling out a large cart (not as tacky as it sounds) and serving drinks in the lobby. We had a great time in Chicago, and like I said the location was great and we didn't spend much time in the room so the stay was bearable...;3;2;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
791;9/6/2011;0tCRk3P4642x-2OCFGhi2g;GqzoKYXv6F1O85bhywyoSA;I have no complains whatsoever about this hotel.  I wished we were able to do a late check out but that was the only thing they were not able to accommodate us with since they had other tenants coming in that sunday.   They were kind enough to change our reservations from 3 nights to 2 nights since our flight was canceled the night of in Vegas at no additional fee.  This hotel is AWESOME on location!  What more can you ask for since its right at the corner of Wabash and the riverwalk!  You are only about a block away from the bar/lounges area across the river, towards the Trump tower also! The hotel is also about 1.5 blocks away from CTA, if you are thinking about going to the airport.  Very do-able for someone that doesn't like walking either!  We upgraded to a river view deluxe king room, which was totally worth it.  The view was gorgeous and our bed... omg our bed made us not want to go out since it was so COMFORTABLE!  That is the most important thing in a hotel for me, the bed and hotel 71 won me over there.  Our room was more than spacious.. more than we could ask for at the rate that we got through travelzoo.  I was quite pleased.  The hotel itself is a large boutique hotel, with very nice and trendy decor.  They have a large office area for customers to use for internet/printing, large gym, and a restaurant/bar named Hoyt's that is open until about 1am everyday.  When it comes to reading all about the cons from other yelpers, those cons mean nothing to me since we were mainly outside, discovering Chicago, instead of trying to stay in our room.   We were accommodated with VIP Shedd Aquarium tickets, which saved us so much time with no lines from the hotel.. There's another plus. I am more than happy that I stayed at this hotel on my trip to Chicago and I wouldn't mind coming back with its perfect location of the river and magnificent mile.;5;2;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

I can't talk about the cost, because our room was paid for as part of a wedding party we were attending (thanks, E!), and yes, valet parking is the standard downtown $45-50/day.  So if you're stuck with driving, you'll pay the price. Our room was definitely larger than expected, well-appointed (though my wife thought it was a little dark -- more lamps needed?), and comfortable.  There was a large medical convention group staying there that weekend as well, but despite the hotel being full, our room was always very quiet.  The bathroom was also quite large, but the tub/shower looked like it had seen better days, with the chrome tarnishing and some of the grout starting to flake.  The adjustable shower head was also no longer adjustable. In spite of these small missteps, we loved being able to walk everywhere in the loop, and we loved the cheerfulness of the front desk folks every time we returned for the night.  It felt like our personal urban oasis.;4;1;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

The rooms are very sizable and have great amenities. I particularly loved the shower (overhead). The only negative I encountered with Hotel 71 is parking. Not surprising due to its awesome location. Parking is expensive and you cannot get your car on demand. For me it wasn't a big deal. There are a lot of parking options (and much cheaper!) if you're willing to walk a couple blocks.;4;1;1;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
794;5/5/2012;5Ce7ABZIGSOnJcGS9HfI3A;jj_zW-i45VFKJ3aJw91RgQ;I'm a little biased on this review, because my wife and I have been spoiled at other hotels we have stayed at.  Not that Hotel 71 is terrible, they just don't measure up to some of the other hotels we have stayed at such as the Westin and our new favorite, Hotel Monaco.  One thing that is important to us is a great view, which Hotel 71 has, but the other hotels we have stayed at have a place at their windows where you can lounge and just relax and enjoy the view.  You have to stand and stare out the window at Hotel 71.  I know I'm being picky, but you would be surprised how nice it is after walking around all day in Chicago and to be able to kick back and just watch either the city lights or the river (Hotel Monaco actually has a little lounging area built into all their windows - very nice).  Also, the walls must be super thin, because we heard our neighbors, talking, not shouting, until 2:30 in the morning!  On the plus side, the rooms were clean, but are starting to show wear, which is ok.  I know hotels can't stay pristine forever, but I just haven't seen this at our other favorite hotels. They also need to have in-room safes.  This is pretty standard in hotels now, so I was surprised we didn't have one in our room. On the plus side, their personnel are very friendly and do their jobs well.  Good customer service is important to me and this is why I'm giving Hotel 71 3 stars.  I think Hotel 71 is a nice hotel, but there are other hotels in the area that are better, at least in my humble opinion.;3;1;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Got a great rate here, and was slightly skeptical as most "boutique" hotels I've stayed in tend to favor style over substance. The hotel is in a great location, the staff was friendly and helpful and the interior was stylish without being gaudy. Used the workout room which was modest, but adequate and had a great city view. The room I stayed in was very large (another rarity with boutique hotels), the TV and cable options were slightly below average, room had a great city view. Bathroom was also spacious and nice. Had one incident with the hot water being too hot in the shower and a staff member was sent up almost immediately and fixed the problem within 5 minutes, and was very friendly.

797;3/31/2009;Rle93s3Kr4TKxLCeU;4u4jJoK_dy5P00f-jQZvRg;I booked a room at this hotel prior to reading the reviews and was a little nervous rolling in. I have no idea what half of these reviews are talking about. Parking: its downtown Chicago, deal with it. Every hotel I have stayed at downtown charged at least $35 a night, so they aren't out of line. I stopped by a few self parks near by, and there was almost no savings, so I just valeted every night. Plus you get in and out. Elevators: Either they changed this problem, or other people stayed at a different hotel then I did. It was a concern of mine after reading the reviews so I made sure to time them. The longest wait I had was 45 seconds. They had 4 elevators 2 serving the first half and 2 serving the other. It worked well. Rooms: Mine I believe was an older one. It was still clean, fairly updated, and without any complaints. My view was of some surrounding buildings and a bit of Michigan Ave, but I didn't care. The location is stellar (within a short walk to every el line in the city), and the price is right. If you're not a chain hotel points whore or some super high maintenance jerk,  you should have no problem staying here.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
798;6/4/2010;kyBlg6bJ;1OXAtzF27jqS9BIww0BO7w;I love this hotel -- even though the first time I stayed here, I rolled off the bus, hungover and half-awake into a very dark lobby and couldn't find the right elevator to get to my room... It's a cute boutique hotel on Wacker on the South side of the river, but close enough to everything downtown (Miracle Mile... Navy Pier, blahblahblah).  It's also in close proximity to the El so getting to Northern neighborhoods (i.e. Wrigleyville, Boystown -- Halstead) is easy enough.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
799;9/22/2010;Ww0XLqyx50DjeHIbSVXwQQ;xicUX7Z7LNVzaUQluEW26w;This is a very pleasant hotel, though it's not the most 'sought out' hotel in downtown Chicago. The staff there is great and I didn't encounter much difficulty checking in, getting my room or ordering when it came to dining at the hotel's restaurant located in the lobby. Price wise, this place is superb. Good deal. The rooms were super spacious and had nice contemporary decor. I had a basic suite with a king-sized bed. The bathroom was a girl's dream, being that it was spacious and included a sliding door closet. Wacker St., where the hotel is faces, offers a great view of the skyscrapers and the waterfront. During my stay, I was lucky enough to see the set-up of the filming of 'Transformers 3,' so this hotel was quite popular then. Wi-fi is also included at this hotel.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

In the heart of downtown, right by the River and Trump Tower, near Michigan Ave and the Bean at Millennium Park! Too bad didn't get around, was on a business trip.. The room was clean, although the bath tub wouldn't drain. I'm not the complaining type so I just left a note to housekeeping and they had it fixed the next day. Room service was very good. Had an awesome Chicken Salad sandwich with a side of fresh fruit salad. In the morning, the good ol' egg white omelet with side of fresh berries oatmeal. The room was also quiet (maybe because I was on 28th floor!) but there is plenty of action if you have time to check out the city.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
801;10/14/2011;1nO71uUl22D2Nuf8GujmDA;RDAheZ5rFAEqPrpR4rxJdA;Stayed here for the Chicago Marathon. We were allowed to check in early and assigned to a fantastic room with tons of space and a SPECTACULAR view. The bed is awesome, pillows were not my style but comfy enough - other hotels are worse! The staff is VERY friendly and helpful. You need toothpaste? they have it, shaving cream? got that too. There were a few hiccups (Marathon related) but nothing significant to really complain about. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here again!!;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

804;7/27/2009;LV6pmjQMtNTo0ohN-55nkw;6M99nmFvtdvwPow0Z9bo-A;If nothing else, this hotel was located in the PERFECT location for visiting/tourist-ing Chicago, and our river-view room had an amazing view. We got to the hotel, and we were actually able to check in about 4 hours before the 3pm check in time, which a huge positive! The space of the room was ok. Nothing special, definitely not boutique-like, as I was hoping it would be. The interior reminded me more of a Holiday Inn than of a hotel that...well, charges as much as this one does. The room size was perfect, even roomy I would say, for 2 adults, while the bathroom size was pretty standard. I know there are some complaints about the elevators, but we were on the 28th floor and had no problem at all. From the lobby, we actually didn't have to wait for one the whole time we were there, and anytime we needed one from our floor, we didn't wait longer than a minute. My biggest complaint was that every single night we stayed there (3 in total), I was woken up by noise in the hallway. Once from noisy elevator traffic and the other two times from a group of drunken girls yelling on the floor. As an NYC native, I have no problem sleeping through noise, and I actually brought/slept with earplugs in all nights, so I think this is really a testament to how thin the doors are. My only other big issue was that the bed was quite uncomfortable. I mean, when I'm traveling, I'm really paying for two things: a bed and good nights sleep:and this hotel couldn't meet either of those. Lucky for them, their location bumped up their rating from 1 star to 3. In all, if you can get a good deal on hotel71, then it might be worth the stay here. If you are a tourist like I was, it more than likely is worth the stay. If you end up having to pay full price, you may be disappointed.  Oh, and if you do end up booking some nights here, make sure to request a room on one of the higher floors.;3;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

The hotel is located right in front of the Riverwalk near the water. You can see all the bridges at night it's so beautiful. The room was good. Flat screen TV, nice bathroom and very large windows. I did have trouble with the TV. It seems that it wasn't plugged in properly and we went without it for a day. Who needs TV when you are on a vacation? They don't have a pool so leave your trunks and bathing suit at home. Bring a laptop cause each room has FREE WI-FI.... That is not a typo!;4;0;1;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
806;2/23/2010;xE6NfpU;ly5ZK97XZoLYR63PxBYRTA;Even though I live in Chicago, I thought a night away from the house on Valentine's would be romantic.  I chose the Hotel 71 for the proximity to the restaurant we were having dinner at, the price and the view of the Chicago River.   The rate of the room was very competitive for the area ($169/night) and the view of the river was great, but I was very underwhelmed with the room overall.   Its my understanding that they are in the middle of renovations and our room had not yet been upgraded and it was VERY obvious.  The porcelain in the tub was peeling, the closet door was off the hinges, and there was a gaping whole in the entertainment center where we expected the minibar to be.   The overall decor of the room is also the antithesis of romantic.  The comforter and curtains are an ugly brown gingham and they clashed terribly with the leopard-print sofa, which would have been awful all on its own. Service was also lacking.  The bar was small and indescript.  There was no ice bucket in the room and we had to call down for one.  And though the hotel seemed far from full, we were given a room RIGHT NEXT to the elevator. This hotel would be sufficient for a business traveler on a budget, as its near The Loop and the Magnificent Mile. But it is NOT a good selection for a romantic getaway.;2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

815;7/26/2008;I92o-uSHqtMTKI8LAH-DFA;2Dr-IrL_eDjVpr7XYtdLig;If not for check-in, I would have given my experience at Hotel 71 five stars.  The premium room was great for what we paid, stylishly furnished, comfortable, quiet, and with an amazing bathroom (seriously, can I take that back to Boston with me??).  The location could not have been better: we bought 3-day CTA passes and barely used them since we could walk almost everywhere.  Prompt and friendly housekeeping and a fantastic 12th-floor river view were icing on the cake and even the elevators were never a problem (!!). Now for the bad part: check-in.  I'm relatively young already and look even younger, which I think wrote "take advantage of me" on my forehead.  When we checked in, we were asked if we'd reserved a premium room with one king, to which I responded no, we'd requested two queens (I was traveling with my brother).  He paused for a minute and told us he'd given us a city view and sent us up to the room.  Well, it turns out he'd given us a standard city view (which wasn't even available on Expedia, but we booked anyway since we got a deal on the premium room).  At first I thought I wouldn't complain since it was probably because they'd gotten the wrong information from Expedia, but I looked up the price difference ($70 per night for four nights) and marched back downstairs, determined either to get the premium room we'd paid for - or at least a standard river view - or to receive some sort of compensation.  Another staff member was very friendly and apologetic and put us in a premium room.  Halfway there, I realized I hadn't mentioned needing two queens and, lo and behold, there was only one king.  I elected my brother to go down to the concierge this time and they finally put us in the room we'd requested: a premium river view with two queens.  Since the room we'd originally reserved was obviously available, I'm not sure why they didn't just put us in it in the first place. That being said, Hotel 71 was indeed a great place to stay in Chicago.  If you can, stay in a premium room.  There is a BIG difference, and I should know!;4;1;1;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
816;7/27/2005;R;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;Formerly the Executive Plaza, the Hotel 71 (named after its numeric address on Wacker Drive) has a nice location along the bend of the Chicago River. This makes the rooms on this side much more desirable than the ones on the opposite side, which looks over an alley and assorted buildings. The standard rooms are very sizeable and comfortable here.

I parked a rental car in their overnight valet throughout my stay.  My last night there, the car was damaged.  I didnt notice it until after I had left the hotel, and stopped at a gas station.  Despite multiple assurances that the issue would be handled accordingly, five months later I still receive phone calls and other correspondence from the rental car company, stating they still have an unpaid repair bill. The service at valet attached to this hotel is sickening.  I waited for 30 minutes to get the car one day, AFTER placing the requested phone call ahead of my departure.  When I left and checked out from the hotel, the car tenant had this evil grin on his face I and was awarded an open door to my rental car.  Gee, I wonder why.

You are at the downtown (near michigan street) and all the day/nightlife awesomeness that is Chicago is around you. Public transportation, restaurants, tourist attractions, bars, clubs, weird people and you're on the chicago river. Also, the rooms are fairly spacious, but older. Oh and Batman Dark Knight was filmed at this location. The down side is it is pricey and there are only a couple elevators that service the hotel - so mornings are a pain in the ass to get up and down from say the 30th floor to the lobby.

Next, I ordered room service since I was crunched for time and found it to be enjoyable...no complaints.  I liked the room I stayed in and did not find it to be as small as I expected after reading other reviews.  It was certainly larger and, dare I say nicer, than the room I stayed in at the Hard Rock Hotel during my only other visit to Chicago.  The bathroom was huge and nicely decorated with a shower and tub and two vanities.  I did not have a problem with the elevators unlike other reviewers.  In fact, there was one waiting for me on several occasions.  The only things I saw as lacking was there was no refrigerator in the room and the bar in the lobby is lame compared to the one at Hard Rock.  Other than that, I'd much rather stay at Hotel 71 on my next visit to Chicago.  It doesn't have the "cool" factor that the Hard Rock has but in many aspects, I found it to be a better hotel.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
835;8/26/2010;SHjohnB5HfoXY;BV_PMkjyPO0838VmlPwqfg;The location and view were amazing but make sure your room is far from the elevators.  They were so incredibly loud that my husband got very little sleep.  Also the internet was painfully slow... used a groupon and they charged an extra fee for using it.  Seemed dishonest as I had asked if there were any other fees when I booked it originally and was told no.;3;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
836;7/20/2010;4uarYeRkgX92wrUSjza2Fw;PGFoh8YPSJ209GJ9Miy7Pg;This hotel is like Joan Rivers. It looks okay on the outside, but everything inside is falling apart. The wallpaper in the hotel room was peeling off, the hot water handle "on" the sink in the bathroom fell off, and the shower faucet sprayed water so strong and aggressively it almost knocked me out of the shower a few times. The towels in the bathroom were cheap and overly linty. There was also no mini-fridge (which is always greatly needed) and the TV was a piece of junk (not a newer flat-screen as their web site indicated)--the reception was also horrific. Great location (despite filming at the time) and the staff were pleasant enough. I later noticed in the lobby cobwebs hanging from the crookedly positioned valances and lights. That should've been our first clue. Anyway, we also ate at the restaurant in the hotel. Very mediocre. There was even a piece of hair or thread on my hamburger bun. Gross.;2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
837;12/12/2009;TJRzgDb68NtUIWJ685CMaA;5VkVBkM1vXu5m2hvXs_mIw;Besides the location and the view, this is by far the most overrated hotel in Chicago,  Our room was severely outdated and literally dirty.  The window had duct tape around the edges (presumably for "insulation").  The sink & shower faucets leaked water everywhere (mold is definitely growing behind the scenes).  The linens felt like sandpaper and there were no extra blankets or pillows.  The closets didn't even have hangers in them.  The television (they advertised flat screens) was a Zenith from the early 90's.  Room service was fast, but the food was mediocre and outrageously expensive.  The only thing slower than the elevators is the valet.  You can expect your car 20 to 30 minutes after calling for it, despite the fact that the garage is attached to the hotel.  If you're on a budget, don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a lot for very little with this hotel.  There are plenty of budget hotels in the city that are much, much nicer than Hotel 71.;1;1;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
838;1/20/2007;34gL-xZscjhEe3M4k6e8xQ;8c53BdBWPcbioN3WZJWdCA;i'm breaking up with this hotel.  we had a really good thing going for a while.  it was my back up when the westin on michigan ave was full.  when you travel as much as i do, you've gotta have a plan B. so we had a few really good nights together.  i asked for exactly what i wanted and the staff would always accomodate me.  i paid they provided service...nothing outrageous. well, the last time i stayed at this multiple personality pensione, they may have been trying to break up with me actually.  i think they were caught off guard cuz i showed up with my 3 offspring and all this homemade italian food in shopping bags which i needed to quickly deliver to my sister.  maybe they thought we were a family on the run and they wanted no part of it.  instead of checking us in they told me they had no record of my reservation.  excuse me, come again, i beg your friggin pardon.  that's fine if you are stupid, i understand not everyone is born with the most useful set of DNA, but come on, i have a confirmation number. so rather than stare at me like you have no idea what to do, just give me a room now so i can unload my crap and get a cab to deliver the now overdue food.  have you ever tried discussing your rights with an idiot?  it just doesn't work.  they don't know the standard rhythm for this sort of thing.  since i was already dealing with the manager, there was really nowhere to go but out on the street.  i finally convinced her disclose their clearly defunct system for online reservations and found the obvious error.  your online reservation is not actually a done deal when you reserve online.  what?!  you mean to tell me if i make a reservation using the website i can't be gauranteed the room i was just confirmed to have been charged for.  yes, that's right folks, you read it correctly.  allegedly, they look at all the online reservations a few times per day so if you happen to have made your reservation after the last time they checked and show up before the next time they check, they actually have no idea why you would be standing at their front desk expecting lodging.  hmm, i wonder if they've ever heard of this new fangled thing called real-time scheduling.  the manager could not have been any more rude, obnoxious, or just plain dumb if she tried.   but finally i did convince her to maybe just to humor me, check the online reservation log and update the reservation file in front of her and lo and behold she found our name.  but the fun didn't end there.  my car which i left out front in a line to be taken away was still there when we went down to get a cab.  their garage was in fact full and they were really sorry but not sorry enough to have a list or directions to any garages that they might have possibly called in advance to make sure there was room and would keep a car overnight.  i guess that was my job.  so now that i made it through hoop number one and actually won a debate with an idiot to get the keys to my room i had another hoop to maneuver.  this could not have sucked more.  i ended up having to drive around for 40 minutes before i found a garage that would take my car overnight that wasn't already full.  this ended up being a giant pain in the neck.  if you ever are forced to stay here and decide to use the internet to make your reservation...you might want to call first to see what time they plan on merging their reservation files and figure out what to do with your car in advance.;1;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
839;3/26/2010;mZbhyo7JIGuOGbmCTaJ0Fg;298ADv1z0ZpF1R0q9q6nlQ;well, its hard to beat the price.  location is great too.  For the money, i found the hotel very typical.  Not nice, but for close to $100/night, what do you expect?  As a frequent business traveler, I've paid more for a dive in Fresno...  My room was comfortable.  Front desk, check in was nearly over-formal for the style of the hotel.  The lobby was clean, nicely decorated.  I wouldn't be embarrassed having a business meeting there.  Pleasant doormen.  I had a corner room which was decent sized and had a great view.   There is a free business center which i used to print copies for a meeting.  Free wireless internet throughout the hotel.  I complained about a slow drain in the shower and it was fixed in a jiffy.  Its surprising how many ppl complain about the decor - the leopard chaise was fine - I actually stayed in a VERY high end hotel in Paris with similar color scheme, including a leopard print chair.  I'd have no problem staying here again.  The biggest problem is that it lacks any identity.  If you want identity, wander down to the Peninsula and fork up $600/night.;3;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
840;9/19/2010;XUE8aOC1ZiQanenGHKdodw;60unW-r0-xd_5_U8dHwmEg;Having spent plenty of time at downtown Chicago hotels, I cannot recommend Hotel 71. I stayed in the Executive Suite and was very disappointed by downtown Chicago standards. The hotel itself seemed as if it were under construction in some of the hallways:ceiling tiles pushed in with wires exposed, the door to the meter room on our floor was open and not secured. Walking the hallways you could hear conversations in every room that you walked by. The suite itself was way below standard, it contained four closets, no of them were in the bedroom, seating for guests around the table in the sitting room was limited because there were only two chairs for the table, there were two televisions, but of the were both tube televisions. The bathroom was sub par and must have been inspired by a motel. There was nothing high class about this suite. I suggest if you want to experience a true hotel suite experience you go somewhere else. Hotel 71 is overpricing what they offer in their suites, you can find better for their price.;2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
841;9/18/2012;A8Or;9NPKooC5kN7qmxiS7B_X5w;Terrific business hotel if you are working downtown. The gym is small but serviceable,  the rooms small but very clean and the restaurant that is attached serves wonderful meals. The best part of this hotel for some meeting clients is the European style lobby. It serves as a first rate office away from home with high speed internet, meeting areas and coffee in the morning . Staff are super polite and  helpful. The area has loads of good place to eat. If you have the time the lake front is an easy stroll from the hotel.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
842;9/24/2012;QRMMpqajI;GxPDJujwVOzraJe_TJ_QHw;I'm not quite sure why this place gets 4 stars. I just spent 3 nights at the Allegro and will not be returning The Hotel: It's old. And dirty.  Like something the cops would raid in Training Day 2 The room: It was the size of a large closet.  The closet was the size of a large cardboard box.  The blinds are old and fold down with a drawstring that takes about 2 minutes to fully open or close.  Not ideal.  The bathroom is great if you enjoy being able to brush your teeth while evacuating your bowels and washing your hair, because all are within an arm's length. The elevators: There are 3 elevators for a 19-story building.  Be prepared for a long wait during peak times.  I actually took the elevator down to go up at around 6pm since they were all full on the way up. The staff: The only reason I give this hotel 2 and not 1 star is the staff.  Very polite, professional and reliable.;2;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
843;8/30/2012;wtUDzj2OAWzO0eg;AVfwXXqM9KOi_rZ_ALxxoQ;Hmm...not so sweet the second time around. I was in town for a wedding and chose to splurge and get a hotel room for two nights.  I had multiple offers from friends to stay with them to save $$  but I wanted to do this.  Should have stayed w/ friends. Don't get me wrong, I still like this hotel, it just lost its luster from my original experience.  I booked my room about a month beforehand on Orbitz and it was still a shit ton of cash-ola.  Two nights was $367.  Yikes!   Check-in and check-out are a breeze, if you pre-pay.   The room was very clean and the a/c worked lovely.   But the bed was definitely not what I remembered it to be.  It was like, lumpy or something.   Maybe it had been used a lot....?  (gross.)   I do love the mirrors in the room.  You kinda have to see it for yourself.  So all in all, it's a nice hotel with the fun perk of wine happy hour.  Who doesn't love that??!;4;2;2;2;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
844;8/18/2012;0dL0;iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA;A-OK.  The reservation desk is on the second floor.  Confused the hell out of me, especially when I arrived during the manager's reception, which was crowded as hell.  The room was cute but the walls paper thin.  Also, the bathroom was claustrophobically tiny.  There was unused space in the room so I think they could have redesigned to make the restroom slightly larger. Free wi-fi if you sign up for their loyalty program.  All they want is an email address.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
845;6/5/2012;Dse;jqp5BEMzEUIWTCt6pezS2Q;I needed a hotel that was a little less spendy than the $200+ rack rate of the conference hotel (and yes, that was with the conference "deal."). Luckily for me, my travel agent (aka the bf) found Hotel Allegro, which was a mile away, for less than 50% of what I would have spent if I had stayed at the conference hotel. Yes, this is less than their advertised rack rate. I have a great travel agent. Hotel Allegro is a Kimpton hotel and after my experience, I must say I'm a fan. A complimentary wine hour (5-6 pm) every day? Don't mind if I do. In the afternoon, chilled water with slices of lemon and lime and either lemonade or a tea spritzer are available for you to quaff after walking around under the blistering sun. In the morning, coffee (hot and iced) and tea, along with a myriad of newspapers (by the way, you can get a paper delivered to your door gratuit), are awaiting you. Hotel lobbies are usually such dead spaces, but here, they're a lively and yet tranquil place for hotel guests to sit and relax. The only drawback is that the morning coffee is of Yale Club quality* (http://www.yelp.com/user…). The room was sumptuous and comfortable. After joining some hotel program, I had all the free wifi I wanted. The maid was scrupulously honest. I left some money as a tip for her (labeled in an envelope "for the maid"), and when I came back, the money was left untouched because I guess she couldn't read English (I read somewhere that this was not uncommon). So the next day, I left the envelope on the bed where it was clear that the money was intended for her. The rest of the staff was also very courteous and accommodating. I had a lovely stay at Hotel Allegro and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. *If you can't be bothered to read my review, it means that the coffee is extremely weak and watered down.;4;4;2;2;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
846;6/11/2012;ja;VyOUa2qgnFjrVdVi3S_7ig;I stayed here from June 7th - 11th fora a birthday weekend getaway, and I found myself pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Comfy beds, trendy decor, two on-site restaurants and a world class staff. I made a big mistake though, forgetting to tip my wonderful house keeper, so to whoever you are - I was in room 602 and I hope that this review makes up for my lack of appreciation. It's completely out-of-character of me and I sincerely apologize. Thank you so much to the Kimpton staff for being some of the most hospitable team members I've come across. You've definitely earned my loyalty in the Kimpton Hotel family and I'm looking forward to a repeat visit. I hope this review finds you and your future guests well. Great hotel, Great location, and one memorable experience to keep forever. Thanks for being rockstars.;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
847;8/12/2012;HbTSlishwp8Yi3b;79LjNkAODyzlwW2X4AqkfA;My husband and I were in town from London, UK for a wedding and stayed at the hotel through part of a very reasonably priced wedding rate.  When I made the reservation online a few months prior, I noted that it was also our anniversary weekend and I would happily pay for champagne and strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arrival.  At check in, the woman at the front desk wished me and my hubby a happy anniversary.  It had been a few months since I had made the reservation and during that time I had gotten some rather unexpected news that I was pregnant (Btw Yelp friends, this is why I haven't Yelp'ed any restaurants lately--morning/all day sickness doesn't allow me to be very adventurous!)  I thanked the woman, confided our baby news and told her that we no longer needed champagne (no point in me getting bitter with the hubs as he chugged down "our" bottle).  An hour after we got to the room, there was a knock at the door and a staff member dropped off sparkling water and a bucket of (what I thought was) champagne.  I sighed and briefly considered just giving the bottle back...until I looked a bit more closely.  Hotel Allegro has popped a bottle of sparkling apple cider into a champagne bucket and included a hand written note congratulating me and the hubby on our anniversary and our new bambino.  BEST HOTEL CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.   Although I didn't get to indulge in anything but water during the 5-6 PM wine hour, my hubby loved it.  Close to all the downtown hot spots, the location of this hotel is spectacular. The only cons...small rooms and not the thickest walls in between rooms.  Without a doubt, I would happily stay there again though!  Absolutely amazing hotel experience with great customer service.;5;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

849;8/16/2012;fPe6WpXuff8zqqUe9FIudw;iLE7_fiv2W_ReMtNUT2xFw;Weird hotel layout. Hotel bar closed at 12 on a Saturday night during lollapalooza. Staff at front desk always seemed harried and overwhelmed. Rooms were tiiiiiinnnnyyyyy. For the price expected better but the room just felt like a mini attempt to be "hip"...it was as if my mom's "decorator" friend designed it. Word to the wise for hotels...if you want to make an older building look updated don't update it with older looking pieces and shabby bathroom fixtures. Also the mirrors all looked as if they had been through the great fire. It was a bit unnerving. I just wanted to look good, but I couldn't tell a thing in them. No wonder I had no free drinks that night! Overall a disappointment for the Kimpton brand.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

851;6/12/2012;u7uWwudlqFo6Dm4O-rT1ag;ZaNDLa0-XkUrxfcT-0ippg;Honestly, I usually like Kimpton's. This one has the worst Feng Shui (why are there mirrors across from the bed? Just creepy!). The walls might as well be made of cardboard because you can hear EVERYTHING happening next door. Pros: Hotel staff is nice, except the lady at the free wine hour who carded me. Seriously? And of course I didn't have my ID because I'm staying at the hotel. Not going all the way back up then down just for your tiny glass of wine. Other pros... clean, bed is relatively comfortable, AC, convenient location... iPod dock. Free WiFi if you register with Kimpton online. Cons: See above plus tiny rooms, even tinier closet, noisy, noisy, noisy!!!!!!!! Decor = not my style. And oh, THEY CARDED ME at the free wine hour which was full of business professionals. I was dressed like a business professional, am pushing 30, and that's just kind of embarrassing to be honest. But again, the worst part is that the walls are made of cardboard and you can hear everything happening everywhere. Bring ear plugs.;2;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

I liked the sweeping staircase--kind of reminded me of the one from Titanic. The lobby is pretty standard, I don't understand why people rave about it. The service didn't really stand out. The concierge was not very good. She didn't really give me any helpful tips/information like they usually do. Her only suggestion was informing me of the 4-course Valentine's Day dinner at the hotel restaurant. Our room was small-- but since we didn't have any luggage-- the size didn't bother us. We also didn't hear any noise from the other rooms and the hotel was quiet overall. We got free wifi by signing up with their rewards program  so that was nice. The bed is hands downs my favorite part of our stay. It was hard to leave it :/ The location is probably its biggest selling point. It was too cold and windy to walk but I can imagine that it would be super nice in the summer. Cab fare is about $7 plus tip to the restaurants off of Michigan. I would rate my overall experience as 3 stars but I'm taking off one star for the non existent service. I will probably pay the extra money to stay at Hotel Palomar next time.;2;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Big comfy bed! Their evening wine hour is cozy, and casual offering beer wine. Sometimes, servers circulate with little bites. I tried the Zumba class once, which was a fun work out with 8 or so other women (including a couple Kimpton staff). They had pitchers of water in the back of the room. As other Yelp reviewers have noted, it can be cramped, but seems like a decent room rate for its location and excellent Kimpton service.;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

We've stayed here for many years and have never had any problem. We usually get one of the smaller rooms, but since we are out and about so much it's perfect. This last time we had cocktails and then appetizers and drinks later on in the lounge, and the bar service was professional and spot on.

857;12/11/2011;rW5eTTZo1yk;Wj5GZi04C6MOqOkTbKY4tA;From first glance you can see that this is an old building, but the insides are very modern. The decor is very nice, especially the oversized Christmas ornaments. The lobby is equipped with modern leather couches that are comforting and stylish. The service is exceptional, everyone was extremely friendly. Was here for a corporate Christmas party and had a blast. The cocktail hour included a never ending open bar. The area that the cocktail hour was held felt a bit crammed, but it was cozy. Since people were not sitting on the couches, they were just getting in the way. If possible I would suggest for them to move the couches around a little for the cocktail hour so there is more standing room and less of moving through a maze.... The dinner served was mouth watering. The steaks were tender and the tilapia was soft and flavorful. *** the steak is cooked medium rear, so if you like it more cooked, get the tilapia. The dessert was not good, at all, maybe only the chocolate covered strawberries but it's hard to mess that up. The cakes and pasties were just not appetizing, the texture, the contents and flavor were all off. The rooms are "small" but I've seen smaller rooms in Europe. In my opinion how much room does a person actually need in a hotel room. A bed, a desk, and maybe a tv..check, check and check. The pillows and the actually bed were soft and comfy. I am always in the lookout for a better pillow, I might actually email the hotel and ask what brand pillows they have so I can purchase some for my home! They provided validated self-parking for $25, ooooor you can do what we did and park less than a block away in the outside self-parking area that has a $14 weekend speacial :) The rooms run about $160 a night on average, and I think that for the location in downtown Chicago and quality if hotel that is a great price. Also, if you are an out of towner, this hotel's location is superb :);4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
858;8/1/2011;QvmBB5mBmgQY0;_JqZNeHVGE2Er1DilS5iEA;My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Allegro for my birthday weeked. It was wonderful. Check-in was smooth and the clerk was very nice and accomodating. We had the standard king room but the bed felt more like a queen. There wasn't much of a view but the did have plently of sunlight. The rooms are so cute. They are small but there is a lot of detail put into them to make you feel like you are in a much bigger space. The bathroom is super small but the french style doors added a nice touch. While my boyfriend and I were getting settled in there was knock and the door. It was room service. The hotel sent us a bottle of champagne and a small box of chocolates as a birthday gift. That was a very nice touch. I joined the Kimpton InTouch program (which is free) before we arrived and for an added bonus we were given free wifi and $10 credit for the mini bar. The valet service was super fast. Everytime we called for the car they had it waiting for us when we arrived down stairs. Our stay was prefect and for an added touch we were given bottle of water for the trip home. All in all this is was a great stay and we can't to go back.;5;3;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
859;11/15/2011;nwI6cb2s4;BhjseQElPkSE1qs7tqx0SA;Stayed here over a 3-day weekend.  Interior is very modern, trendy, and has an upscale feel for Gen X & Y-types.  This place reminds me a bit of the W-Hotel chain, but not as trendy. The Bad:   The room was fairly small. Disappointing.  The desk and bathroom tops were not very clean - they were full of stains.  The biggest annoyance during my stay was how thin the walls were.  I could literally hear the girls next door complaining about how some guy wasn't giving them any attention at the club - word for word.  I dont wanna hear any conversations from next door when I want to fall asleep (after 1am?) especially when the going rate is  $160+ a night.  Oh, and I could clearly hear a couple having sex on another side of the room.  Nice. (not really)   Advice to management: install more sound insulation between rooms. The Good: Service is friendly and attentive.  The hotel provides free wine (to guests) in the lobby at 5pm.  Nice.   There is a lounge called Encore on the first floor (didnt go, but it looks like a nice place to hangout for a drink).  Hotel provides a nice breakfast every morning, including plenty ice water (with lemon) in the lobby and freshly-popped popcorn in the afternoons. Location is next to the Chicago theater district and is fairly close to all the tourist spots. For $160+ a night, I expected a little more.  Not sure I will come back here, unless I get a great deal.  For the most part, the hotel is fine, but dont expect a quiet space in your room.  If you are looking for peace and tranquility, you may want to look elsewhere.;3;1;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
860;10/11/2011;SnbI949-yceutL9KH2d0ZA;woZhhAj9QrzMYBJ8M7uJFA;Hello Chicago! On my 1st ever visit to Chicago I stayed 3 days/ 2 nights with the girlfriend at Hotel Allegro. She was there for work so I tagged along since I'd never been to Chicago. Hotel Allegro has a prime location in the Loop & was only a short walk after getting off the CTA Blue Line. The lobby & common areas of Hotel Allegro are grandly & sharply dressed. The girlfriend & I arrived early morning so our room wasn't ready yet. Front desk service was thoughtful as they offered to stow our luggage & call us as soon as our room was ready. Free coffee, tea, etc is available in the lobby in the morning. We grabbed coffees & set out for some breakfast & exploration while our room was prepped. The call came while we were still eating breakfast. That was fast. Back at the hotel, service continued to be thoughtful as staff confirmed that the girlfriend was on an extended business stay & made sure she had a quiet room high enough from the street, on the corner & away from the elevator. The room itself was clean, smartly decorated & felt like it had been recently renovated, but smelled faintly of paint. Being a Queen Deluxe room, it was on the small side. While it had all the basic amenities, there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room. Free Wi-Fi is available in the room if you're signed up with Kimpton's Loyalty Program. No problem. I see this as a better option than paying $10 - $20 for 24 hours of internet access. So I signed up, got free Wi-Fi & Kimpton has since been nice enough to not assault my email inbox with loads of junk. For my 1st time in Chicago, Hotel Allegro was a great place to stay. It's a hotel that's been deftly redone, is centrally located, pays particular attention to service & has nice but smallish rooms. Any future trip to Chicago may also include a stay at Hotel Allegro.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
861;10/15/2011;9vH;9unR5cAeDx1CPtKH2Hctfw;Stayed here for a girls weekend because we got a great rate.  Location was very good.  We could walk to most of the Chicago tourist attractions.  The decor is modern and cool.  The rooms are tiny - I'd guess because it's a historic building - and there's no ventilation in the bathroom so everything stays wet all day.  There's also no coffee maker in the room, because they have coffee service in the lobby every morning.  They could use to update the elevator systems.  They're extremely slow and everyone lines up to cram into a car because they'd rather be up against someone else than wait another 10 minutes for the next one to come along.  A plus is the complimentary wine in the lobby every afternoon.  Overall we had a good stay, but I do think the quality doesn't quite live up to the price. Oh, and sign up for Kimpton preferred guest program (free) to access free wifi.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
862;8/5/2011;d0gRM3cIev573Sw4EXv;C_aCzdTcV6g57UbfvbflSg;Sometimes ya just need a staycation. That's what brought us here and we loved it. Loved: *the modern fun decor *the price *the layout of the lobby creates lots of cool seating areas *aveda bath goodies *a nice selection of complimentary items(incase you forget your fashion tape) *comfy bed *helpful staff *only about a half mile walk from the train station But seriously what is up with the crazy slow elevators?;5;1;2;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
863;7/7/2011;-7;uMLAo3ALUySWisGSlWX93g;Stayed here for the 4th of July weekend. PROS - - PET FRIENDLY (at no extra charge) - walking distance to a 7/11 (that sells hard alcohol!) - 10 minute walk away from The Bean and Willis Tower - cabs are always available - free wine everyday at the lobby from 5pm to 6pm - friendly staff - easy to find - 2 blocks from the O'Hare train line (Clark/Lake station) - decent room prices (we paid $110/night) via http://Hotels.com - free internet access - they have a "recyclables" trash can in the bedrooms! go green! :) CONS -   - the non-suite bedrooms are notably small. - bathroom mirror area is very small as well. only one person at a time.   - Room walls are very thin.  We were able to hear our neighbors' conversations and their tvs! we were also awakened by people having conversations in the hallway. good thing we weren't in the room that often! - no mini fridge - ice machines NOT available on every floor - on demand movies are $18.99! I'd stay here again, but I'd definitely book a larger room (i.e. a suite);3;0;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
864;7/25/2011;9zsC10rcDYREg3hZOGhbYg;ONQhvkryJEaeLDZ8uBq2VQ;We stayed here: 1. Because they are pet friendly 2. Because they had the best rates downtown 3. Parking was only (ha) $36 for the night I was researching places to stay in Chicago for a good week before deciding on Hotel Allegro. It was nice they weren't charging the $50-100 pet fee other hotels in the area seem to think is normal. Also, they didn't have a size restriction. Our dog isn't huge, but she's about 50lbs and a lot of other hotels have a max of 25-30lbs. Dog racists if you ask me! There isn't any grass near the hotel that we could find (within 5 blocks at least) so if your dog needs grass to go, I would look elsewhere. Parking was a bitch. The parking garage isn't connected to the hotel, so you're stuck lugging your suitcases, purse, dog etc. down the busy sidewalks of Chicago. It's only half a block away but when you have a ton of crap, it seems like miles. The room was nice and CLEAN. And it was really quiet the whole time we were there. My only complaint about the room itself was the fact our thermostat was broken and we were freezing the whole night. It was stuck in the "on" position at 67 degrees, there was no way to turn off the fan or anything. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave quite easily from this location, and the Sears tower is close by.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
865;7/12/2011;tEVngiL6EwLz6uuQxicV5w;0TWqlGuQYMwgpiNCi5we2w;I came for a training and stayed 2 nights. The food that they catered was semi decent but nothing mind blowing, but that could have been because of the menu the facilitators chose. The decor in the lobby is funky/retro/neat but the rooms were tiny!. There was barely any space to pass between the dresser and the bed. Also the bathroom doors weren't real doors, they were more like shutters. And as others have complained, you can hear everything that's happening in the hallways and the rooms next to you.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
866;4/1/2011;H3cGdhDt5r2bpsZ3lXLDzQ;vZsPmGkI-vRl-w3y9RAxFQ;I've stayed at the Allegro several times in the past 5 years. Yes, the rooms tend to be small - but it's an historic building in downtown Chicago, and that's to be expected! From what I've experienced staying in other hotels in that area the Allegro's rooms are a fine size, and much nicer than most as far as decor and amenities. On our last visit (a weekend trip) we were offered a last-minute upgrade and got a huge 2-room suite for a fantastic price. We loved it, jacuzzi tub and all. Also, they've updated the wallpaper, furniture, and bedding since our last stay -- gorgeous. Staff were nice and helpful as always, the evening wine/cheese party was a plus, and the location is perfect for a weekend touring around downtown. Probably the only complaint I might have is that noise can be a problem - we could hear the person in the room behind ours when he talked on the phone. Of course, that might have just been because he was shouting... Oh - last but not least, they have FABULOUS swag bags for the kids. If you're traveling with little people, make sure you tell staff when you make the reservation.;4;1;0;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
867;4/2/2012;gG0yeucpn0MoBAO9BGzRuA;WNSLaaRk_x43N2MmPs2ztw;Beautiful hotel - very modern and stylish decor, front desk and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I didn't give this a five star because our room was tiny. Besides for the size I loved the view and modern amenities.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
868;9/6/2011;-t24AK9TvWJHJRiTVsYLxg;MGgVFzNlMPGxqUHREhdiPQ;I cannot believe this place gets such high reviews.  Maybe everyone who gives it 4 or 5 stars stayed in suite??  Or is hard of hearing?  Or enjoys using a converted closet as a bathroom? I only booked this hotel bc I got a special deal, at full price it's a total rip off.  I have no idea what a suite looks like, but the rooms are teensy tiny, even by urban city hotel standards.  The bathroom is even smaller and the sink splashes water on you.  The walls are paper thin, I was woken up at 2 am by a girly laugh fest  (I decided it was the universe paying me back for the hotel guests my friends and I woke at 4am when I stayed at the Hilton in SF).   And the service isn't all that great either.  I put in a request for a rollaway when I checked in and when I went to check on the status was told that they had none available.  I still can't figure out why I can't request one ahead of time.  It took a good 30 seconds of hard staring at the lady bf I got an apology.  I had to ask multiple times for late check out and despite the fact that I got the ok to check out at 1pm, I got a knock at the door at 1230.   Yes, the lobby is beautiful but I'm not sleeping in the lobby.  That hardly makes up for the shortcomings of the place. I loved Chicago and will come back, but def will not stay here again.;2;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
869;7/11/2011;xXh7Uj-u1PkmP7YfbHK2TA;vYXiZHg5cqxsCU3OCBwidw;Very tasteful and "funky" decor.  Staff was super nice.  Wine hour is a wonderful touch.  Rooms were a little on the small side, but larger than I was expecting for a downtown "historic" hotel. We had no noise problems (maybe we were the ones making noise for others though?! LOL) Cabs readily available.  Walking distance to Union station and Ogilvie transportation center - and madison st. water taxi.   Overall, nothing was amazingly outstanding, but everything was very nice.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
870;5/23/2011;QeiGkSS1YXUxFxE7u3bTGw;XAFj3zEXusHYJW_UBuIi4A;Stayed here for my sister's wedding.  The rooms were nice, and I hear we got quite a discount on them.  There was a computer issue that resulted in us being placed in an occupied room - and then a second time the desk receptionist misheard my name and put us in my aunt's room.  They were extremely apologetic and gave us a $40 voucher for the hotel restaurant as compensation.  It really wasn't that much trouble for us, though. If you join the Kimpton InTouch membership club (free), you get free wifi connectivity in your room as well as Raid the Minibar privileges, which allow you to get up to 2 items, for a total of $10, from the minibar for free. The hotel has a lot of great lounge areas, and the 312 restaurant is good as well (separate review for that).  They did a fantastic job with the cocktail hour and reception, and everything else was great. I've since lost a key to my car, and I've called them numerous times to check back if it's been found, and their lost and found office is fantastic.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
871;5/19/2011;HRZbeHSdb6hhwLj9mO4CtQ;abSv4EROV16qmh0W-xHZAA;What can I say... I LOVE this place!! I booked a vacation through Orbitz and this was the hotel that came with the package I chose.  The location is perfect (close to everything you need... restaurants, shopping, theaters) and soooo cute!! Beautiful lobby with free "wine hour" every night from 5-6pm (you can't beat that!!) Our room was a little on the small side, but for two people (and the price) it was a DEAL!! The staff was so friendly and helpful too!! The concierge became my best friend that weekend!!  I loved this city (and this hotel) so much I will definately be back SOON!!!;5;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
872;10/21/2010;6occ7ZHMR-O5AEuySlKs1A;nt143HoSFyPLsVNaI1fGrQ;I enjoy the Kimpton Hotel chain- I feel like I know what I am getting, and am rarely disappointed.   Thanks to Yelp - I knew in advance that my room would be teeny tiny- and in the Loop, I wasn't expecting much more.  The room was fully functional for what it was.  The decor was a little interesting - my husband joked that the TV stand/mini-bar looked like they gave a 2 year old a marker and let them go to town.  Bathroom was super small, but had everything I needed and was actually the best decorated part of the room.  Our bathroom sink had an extended counter where there was room for toiletries unlike some of the other reviewers rooms.  We did not have a noise problem in our room whatsoever - I never heard a thing in the hallway or on the other side of the wall.  Wi-Fi is free if you sign up for Kimpton In Touch membership. The lobby is fantastic, especially the hidden sitting room behind the fireplace wall.  I enjoy the Kimpton's hour long wine reception btw 5 and 6.  A perfect starter before heading out into the city for dinner.  They also have a Wii in the lobby which is a great distraction for the younger travelers.  There is both a restaurant and bar in the building as well. The elevator situation is less than ideal - long waits and overcrowded.  I suppose this is to be expected in any tall building - What can you do?  Location in the Loop is nice, and located not too far from access to the El and the subway. My husband gets the government rate - so if you book early enough, can't complain for $158 a night.  It was also an anniversay trip, so the hotel sent a bottle of champagne up to our room free of charge. The only negative at this point - I made a local call from the hotel room - and got charged $1.50.  Not the end of the world, but since when are there charges for local calls??;4;3;3;3;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

874;7/26/2011;woQ-pq6WhSIV4e3DKN1HQA;ceLfRakgt0FspxmvKYHqVA;This hotel was extremely nice for it being downtown. The prices are great and the staff is very friendly. Though this is a pet friendly facility, no pets ever got in our way or were too loud. There's a restaurant called "321" hooked up in the hotel. The food is pretty good and the waiters are almost too ridiculously funny and nice. Then there's the Encore bar..which I'm pretty sure only tourists hang out there, so if you're into annoying tourists..I say this is where it's at. OH AND TOURISTS ARE SO RUDE. UNGRATEFUL, AND ANNOYING. I couldn't believe Chicago was filled with such snotty middle class white people in the summer. ANYWAYS...The lobby is really cool! They serve coffee in the mornings, water and ice tea in the afternoon, and wine at night, for free! It's also a cool place to hang out since the rooms are so small. However small the rooms may be, it was a nice room. Most hotel rooms you'll find in ANY city will be that small. Especially at such a good price. I would come here again.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
875;8/1/2006;bCXzgxxzk-djC02AO47Rrg;mD5PC5VxquYuufqQZBGz4Q;The design and over-all look to the place is fun and refreshing from your standard generic hotel fare -- sure to attract many a hipster.  But it seemed like it was mostly old ladies in town to see Tommy Tune in Dr. Dolittle or some other show, as this place is smack dab in the theater district. The price is right, and the staff are actually pretty helpful.  We had a tub that wouldn't drain and by the time we got back from breakfast it was fixed.  Not bad. The TV is the sadly the same 2001 fakey flat screen Toshiba that I have at home -- and it had a bad hissing problem until I figured out the volume settings were all wonky.  But still, not bad.  The wifi was working and the Chivas in the wet bar was only 5 bucks so I was happy. Then came Monday morning.  9 am.  It sounded like a guy was having a wrestling match with his vacuum cleaner outside our door.  Tried as a might to sleep through it, I just couldn't.  The guy was yelling, banging around, vacuuming up a storm, seemingly in the same square foot of carpet right next to our door for at least a half hour.  And right as I'd given up all hope of not having to get out of bed and calling someone -- he moved on.  Not the way you'd want to be woken up after a long night. But aside from that incident and the small nit-picky things, it was a good place to stay.  It was too bad we weren't around for the free wine services -- that seemed like a nice bonus.  I can't say anything about the restaurant or the bar that are next door, they looked a bit over-priced and well, not the kind of places I'd go to.  But those places probably have their own yelp pages.;3;4;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

878;10/16/2007;iuhX5nUv2f3ud7RWmDcrqA;fBP2Rsng1osoRBgyWx2kag;Stayed here on my birthday one year after seeing Aida at Cadillac Palace.  Two seconds into the room I turned around and headed back to the front desk. Being located directly outside of the El was not on my agenda, and I live only 30 minutes away so for that price I would have drove home. They upgraded us to a 4 room suite.  Large at least 10 person tub, elegant sitting room, wonderful robes and slippers - and one of the most comfortable  beds ever.  The room service was ok - I liked ordering from on screen, but the food itself was so-so. Again being a vegan I was limited to a bagel, fruit, and juice. Very friendly and accomodating staff, I would not stay in anything less than a suite here though, the regular rack rooms are tiny and not worth the price being so close to the El;3;4;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Spent four nights at the Allegro and I really didn't find anything to complain about, save for the peak time rush hours on the three small elevators.  I also can't find the words to really rave about any particular aspect of the place, either.  It was a solid three-star experience. My room was small and a bit quirky (two separate closets and only three small drawers to work with), but it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfy.  Huge flat screen TV and iHome were nice touches, but the flat screen is WAY too big for the room I did not unlock the minibar for fear of setting of some kind of remote alarm and starting WWIII, and then getting a bill for having done so. The third star is solidly-earned for the 5:00 - 6:00 FREE wine happy hour.  A very nice touch. I attended a conference in the hotel as well, and all of the various fixin's were ok:  coffee and pastry in the mornings:cookies, soft pretzels, and chips and guac in the afternoons provided a nice variety of sugar rush fixes. All in all, a solid hotel, but $289 per night seemed like a stretch.  This is the third hotel at which I've spent significant time in Chi-town in the past year, and The James still holds the torch.;3;3;2;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
880;10/1/2009;KCZ7zeVV2iRcEOYBd0XkHw;THE2FJCXhH4F9DRUzWUbUA;I was excited when we booked this Kimpton hotel through Hotwire, especially after having a fun experience earlier this year at Hotel Monaco in Denver. I was expecting more free wine and cheese and hotel full of quirky character. I got all that AND a mirror in front of our bed. "Why is there a mirror on the wall in front of our bed?" He looked at me when I asked that question. He's not complaining:he loved it that there was a mirror in front of our bed. Cheers to Hotel Allegro for keeping it kinky. P.S. Just valet it if you're staying overnight. $44 for self-park vs. $49 for valet. Yup, that's what we get for staying at a hotel in the Loop.;4;3;3;4;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
881;6/24/2009;OpyA3fsZIfRCP3AB0F8ZTQ;T5snvtxYBKOMN6O41RSpsw;The Hotel Allegro and I had a 10 month relationship, from 5/2008 until my wedding day in March 2009. We had our ups and downs, but when we finally parted and settled our bill, I couldn't have asked for a better time together. Here are the straight up facts - wedding related, and not. 1. The wedding coordinator, Kerry, despite her insane schedule, got back to me in a reasonable amount of time.  While sometimes I wanted answers ASAP, I had to remember not everyone checks their work email at 6pm Sunday night. Kerry was extremely patient with my now husband and I while we flipped flopped between action stations and a plated meal until the last possible minute.  She understood our situation of planning from out of state and only being able to meet in person a couple times before the big day.  And throughout the process, Kerry was nice, yet didn't give us any B.S. 2. Free Wine Hour. 3. Food = awesome.  Fully surpassed everyone's thoughts on what wedding food usually tastes like.  People are still talking about the mashed potato bar, beef wellington puffs (appetizers), and the pasta bar. 4. Rooms. During my 4 night stay, I was in a spacious suite, but even guests and parents who stayed in regular rooms never complained about the size.  Everything was comfy, clean, and well decorated. Not to mention the location of the hotel was perfect for out of town guests to see Millennium Park, Daley Plaza, "Marshall Fields", State Street, etc. 5. Decor.  I heart the decor.  It made for awesome wedding photos! 6. Free Wine. 7. Room Block.  Due to the tanking economy, the Allegro kept dropping their rates.  We had to renegotiate our block rate a couple times, but in the end, everything worked out okay. 8. Free Wine.  Did I say that yet?  Because every guest staying at the hotel thoroughly enjoyed it. After my relationship with the Allegro, part of me doesn't want to stay here ever again.  Why?  Because I had such an amazing wedding weekend, I don't want anything to mess with my memories and current thoughts!;4;4;2;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The sucky part of the hotel is the actual room (I've stayed here a number of times, it's consistent).  Old A/C wall units will dry you out to a crisp, and a 1 degree change on the thermostat equates to a 10 degree swing.  The bathroom is uncomfortably small, even for a boutique hotel.  It's small, even if you were in Europe at a boutique hotel.  Lilliputian.  The basin is a joke, but at least the shower is made for adult-sized people.  Carpet is old, walls are thin.  Beds are decent though, and if you're an In-Touch member you do get $10 mini bar credit. Fitness center is serviceable so at least you got that going for you.;3;3;4;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
883;8/7/2010;7pS3qyZelxsOwQPqqxAnsw;aKN3Fq2uaRJTwZRPlI5GcQ;Why is it that hotels feel they can impress you with a monster lobby and then cram you into a tiny room? I don't know about you, but that just don't seem to add up. In fact, the Allegro doesn't just have one lobby - it has two. You walk in on the ground floor, with a very impressive staircase leading upwards to, wait for it, the real lobby! It's an elegant, gorgeous and spacious room that's well-decorated and filled with people. It actually took me a moment to find the check-in desk, as it was tucked away in the corner of the room. ...or maybe I just got distracted by the free wine bar. As I would later learn, there is a complimentary wine tasting everyday which includes red, white and house sangria. Oh baby. I checked into the hotel, was given my room key, headed upstairs and found - a tiny room. A bed, a TV tucked in the corner and just enough room for a desk and a night table.  When the bathroom doors open, they almost touch the opposite wall. Everything felt cramped in the worst way possible. The room was also decorated with this 1970's wallpaper of a white background with brown circles and squares. I looked at it for a few minutes and actually felt reality start to slip away from me as I slowly began to loose my mind. Thanks Hotel Allegro for that experience. Plus, they had this funky rounded sink that splashed water on me every time I turned it on! Every time! Gah! There was free Internet, which was nice, but you had to first sign up for a really annoying honored guest program to get it. Somehow, I felt less than honored if I had to jump through hoops to get Internet - but that's just me. So, for the splendor and free wine of downstairs, I'm giving a 5, but for the room, I'm giving a 2 - and rounding down to about a 3. And that's what I have to say about that.;3;2;1;2;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Not my favorite Kimpton, but they definitely had the lowest price of the Kimptons in Chicago while I was visiting.;3;1;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
886;12/15/2008;jOUZJ1epOVdwVC;mgoDA8SYlSJrQ50fkMCFeA;I loved this hotel- it was worthy of dancin on the bed once I plugged my ipod into the docking station/alarm clock. I gotta get me one of those! Upon arrival, my first impressions were of the good location, only a few blocks from the river and Millennium Park. Next, the lobby was decorated very chic and modern. The complimentary wine happy hour in the early evening was perfect. We took a few glasses up to our room after checking in with no problems and were pleasantly surprised with the hip decor of the rooms. The bed looked super cozy and proved later to be just that. The room and bathroom were a little on the smallish side but normal for Chicago standards. The concierge later recommended a great pizzeria for dinner and printed out a map for us to give the cab driver. He also suggested a few tourist things for us to do and reserved tickets for us on the Architectural Boat Tour. Very helpful! Be forewarned, the movies are expensive to rent and watch on the big screen LCD TVs in the room. That's my only complaint!;4;2;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
887;3/28/2009;fKYUaVQKHJmz-TlHrLKqAw;Ohhrhu1RkqfVciIVx_W5HQ;I am pretty shocked this is a Kimpton hotel. It is sort of like a knock off or half brother of a Kimpton. The room seems run down (wall paper separating, drawer knobs wobbly, base boards beat up, broken toilet). Yes, they had the nice Aveda bath products and nice minibar, but the comparison stopped there for sure. Next Chicago trip, I'll go back to the drake for sure.;2;2;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
888;4/8/2010;bRiFguiyxifjhJvJfOA4Yw;wgjWF0vbrn86IIBcAoZ7aw;My friend's company had an event here, and I went along as his date. This hotel has more of a modern twist to it than, say, the Drake or the Palomar House. The lobby and the suites are decked out in geometric and Art Deco patterns -- some pretty wacky and colorful, but tasteful at the same time. The room was smaller than average and lacked a decent view, but it did have a very nice flat screen TV and French doors leading to the bathroom. The booklets on the desk would have been helpful to me had I been a tourist. We had complimentary drinks in the lobby before dinner, along with some delicious little hors d'oeuvres. The banquet room is a little more old-world looking than the rest of the hotel. All the food was pretty delicious, from the Caesar salad to the chicken to the chocolate cake and coffee. The round tables for eight were nice and roomy. Sometimes I feel squished in and crowded at banquet tables, but not here. After dinner, we had some more drinks at Encore, the hotel bar. The round bar in the middle is nicely designed, and the cocktails are prepared with care rather than quickly thrown together. Bottom line, if you love Art Deco and want to stay somewhere close to the theater district in the city, this may be a good option. But with more classic hotels in the area offering similar prices and more of an old-Chicago atmosphere, I'd rather stay at one of those.;4;2;2;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
889;5/24/2009;zYGps68tESg8zaX5oLifgw;310aqkwHk5K9IMWH0c0YcQ;The concierge was so very helpful we enjoyed him very much. the location is great, especially if you like the theater, and there's lots of good shopping and restaurants nearby. Kimpton hotels are fabulous, so, the rooms may have been kind of small, but the decoration and music and attention to detail more than made up for the room size. I enjoyed my stay very much!;5;2;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
890;1/23/2010;3V3Yoa861y2hfX4ALra7XQ;-Vy8Q4uAt-X7KzlTjnxmXQ;Having our wedding at the Hotel Allegro was hands-down the best wedding-planning decision my husband and I made. We checked out a number of historic hotels downtown and left each one feeling pretty "meh." We saw blah ballrooms, met with indifferent hotel event coordinators, and we were starting to think we wouldn't find the spot we were looking for, until we saw the Allegro. The ballroom is gorgeous and was perfect for our 150-person wedding. It's modern, but with many historic touches, and we loved the urban feel of having the L go by the ballroom windows during the evening reception (but you absolutely couldn't hear the train). And we got so many compliments from our guests on the food. We didn't hire a wedding coordinator, and yet every part of our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to the amazing Allegro staff. From the doormen to the bellhops to the desk staff, I have never met a friendlier and more helpful group of hotel employees.  The catering/event staff in particular made the entire experience painless. My feelings were reaffirmed when my husband and I came back to the Allegro to reshoot our wedding photos recently. Shortly after our wedding, we found out our photographer had lost our wedding photos (wedding tip: when researching photographers, ask them how and when they back up their photos).  We decided to throw on the ol' tux and white dress and take some new photos with a new photographer, and when I contacted catering managers Kerry and Alyssa they couldn't have been more sympathetic or helpful. When we came by to retake the photos they surprised us with the hospitality suite for the afternoon (easily one of the coolest hotel rooms in the city) and a bottle of bubbly. We got some great photos in the suite, lobby and ballroom. Kerry and Alyssa really helped make an unfortunate situation fun and memorable -- four whole months after our event.   The Allegro is a fun, stylish hotel all on its own, but the staff is what makes it a particularly special place for an event.;5;4;3;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
891;4/12/2007;8HBeo69OcAu4u6VvRkgXHw;VeuwCtfmB4VyXWuUYbZp8w;I didn't stay long enough to get find out how everything was, but honestly how can you screw up a one night stay?  Well I'm sure there are ways.  But overall I had a good stay.  The decor was that of a Kimpton - eccentric and themed.  They wanted you to feel like a rock star so the decor reflected that.  The bathrobes in the closet were leopard print and zebra print.  There was Mr. Bubbles bubble bath for the bath.  My favorite amenity was the Aveda products.  I also had a end suite which had a separate sitting room area complete with an oversized round stool in the entry way. I ordered room service for breakfast and that was probably a mistake.  The coffee was terrible, tasted pretty water down so I didn't finish it.  It was also pretty spendy but room service usually is.  Don't order fruit yogurt, they take plain yogurt and add strawberry jam to it - or at least that's what it looked like.;3;2;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
892;11/2/2008;vrkfV8wZaqpnd-WdyzHJKw;-xXMng-AgRWe80kqg8zzfw;There's a certain ridiculousness about this place.  The decor is absurd.  It's like some sort of satanic Eyes Wide Shut wannabe mixed with Ikea mixed with some Ansel Adams/Norman Rockwell musical-note visual art (no nod to actual MUSIC however, unless you count the date-rape disco being piped into the lobby area).   THE ROOMS ARE TINY!!!  I reserved the room online and wondered why it was so cheap for the area, but the web photos looked so nice.  Well, because it's like a 10 x 7 ft. room with a dinky washbasin in lieu of a sink, cruise-ship style.  FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT STAY IN ONE OF THE REGULAR ROOMS WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD!  You could go nuts enough to write in a bunch of ALLCAPs at the memory. I did appreciate the power strip embedded in the side of the desk.. They have a drink at their bar called the "Crimson Cooler" -- it's made with organic hibiscus infused vodka, muddled organic strawberries, organic agave nectar, and thai basil.  It's my perfect drink.  The bar was closed to the public though for private parties half the time we were there, which was rather disappointing and annoying. I'll be trying another hotel next time I visit the windy city. (I feel like such a honkey writing this review.);3;2;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
893;3/24/2009;LaP-9BZJDoTMC21Wv81S5g;0G43iKmKRMdGWcmvfSH7sw;Stayed here Valentines Night and was very pleased. The rooms are very modern and hip--as is the whole Hotel. We thought the size was just right for a nights stay, or even for a weekend. We loved having the iHome and the huge TV. The bathroom is a bit small, but you aren't sleeping in there, are ya? One of the best accommodations about this hotel was the complimentary breakfast--it is one of a kind. It is not the typical doughnuts and coffee table. It is a little bar area that a woman controls. Each person gets a juice, coffee or tea, a piece of fruit, and some kind of bakery good. Each item was fresh and delicious. And we loved the spunky seating area.;4;1;2;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
894;12/3/2009;H1l6xuMqyhiTw1gLC7AzpQ;4I7aa289QLmeKm-YabKbYg;Strengths: Hotel was trendy and clean.  Staff was pleasant.  Gym was nicely sized and equipped.  Hosted happy hour was AWESOME. Weaknesses:  The location is not that great.  Yes, this is in the Loop, but in hindsight, as a tourist we should've stayed north of the river.  The bathrooms are pretty tiny. Opportunities:  More leniency with the hotel restaurant vouchers would be nice :) Threats:  Being that I'm a first time visitor, I cannot compare with other local hotels.  I would say that this Kimpton was much cleaner than the one I stayed in when I was in DC. Total:  $89 per night;4;1;2;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
895;1/2/2012;c2166Yhnha0HLEYwmHFF6Q;EFO7sC7has8tZBJoUdnwXA;This hotel is nice, Its got great, fun, style. The lobby is really nicely done. I like the way the room looked but the bathroom sink was tiny. The King size bed was perfect, so comfy in fact that I looked for the brand on the mattress for my own house. The staff were great too. I do have a major issue though and thats the fact that I remember being in this hotel in 1995 and I was BLOWN AWAY with the original Art Deco style of this building. Now, only the elevator doors remain. It breaks my heart to see the destruction of architectural heritage. I dont know if it was the Kimpton people or some other company that "remodeled" this place but I cant think of anything else when I walk through it.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
896;1/19/2010;gvaVzX4-QPO6-Q7hAY;5sd33XzAaQdAURimI670WA;It is funny, I did not appriciate this hotel as much until I stayed at a few other places.  I originally thought it was small rooms and that was about it... but read on. The more times I stayed here, the more I enjoyed it.  First off, I have always found the service to be great.  I feel welcomed when I check in, and feel like they appriciated my stay when I check out.  That is big... hotels are a service industry and many lose sight of that!  Overall, I would say the service here is top notch (and I have stayed at many of the more pricey places in the area too). The rooms could be hit or miss... but are always clean and everything is working order.  The closets can be small or not there, so when checking in be sure to make sure you get a room with a decent closet if you are staying a few days!  I have had tiny rooms, regular rooms and suites.  The suites are very large BTW. Here are the downsides or things to watch for (and again, I am giving it 4 stars so you could see it does not matter too much): No coffee makers in the room... I have coffee 24/7 so that is a bit of a challenge.  There is a Dunkin Donuts next door though, no biggie. The elevators could be SLOW during peak times.  If you need a speedy exit, choose a low floor or something close to the stairs. If you like it uber quiet, be sure to ask for something away from the trains. Upsides: Aveda bath soaps.  Sure it is a small thing, but they are nice products and not cheap. iHome alarm clocks (I forget if all rooms have them or just the suites).  Charge your iPod and wake up to your music.  Good stuff! Nice TV's.  I never turn mine on, but if you are a TV nut they are good. Eco-Friendly:  I'm not a tree hugger... but if you are the non-leg-shaving type you might admire their efforts! Free wine hour/happy hour:  Usually have some good apps and wine plus some seasonal drinks (spiked hot toddy the last time) Helpful staff:  Always a plus! Well done Kimpton and Allegro.  I'm sitting in your room as I type this, back for maybe my 15th stay here.  For 1/2 the price of some of the other spots, I'm glad I stay with you!;4;3;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
897;10/12/2011;KdEWjpHJsMw-r2KftcmCAQ;WmaOYTwaDAEAR7qS-fBSrg;We stayed here 3 nights on our first trip to Chicago, not really knowing the neighborhoods or preferred locales. To our surprise the hotel is in a great location, walking distance to a lot of restaurants. If you need to go further out, a $5 cab ride will get you there. Encore Liquid Lounge was a perfect spot for us to unwind that first night, as well as a good starting point every night thereafter. This is a renovated hotel, so you need to come with proper expectations. You can tell this is a very old building, with rooms that are very small compared to newer hotels. But that's the way it was back then and I've experienced the same in similar hotels in other cities. Given all that, they've done an excellent job on the renovation. The rooms are clean and up-to-date. The bathrooms are beautiful. The lobby is done really well and makes a great place for the nightly wine-hour. The standout for us was the staff. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, everyone was incredibly considerate and polite. We always ask everyone besides the concierge on what to do and where to go. Julio gave us great recommendations and presented genuine thoughtfulness. Definitely seek this gentleman out. We would and have recommended this hotel to others with proper expectations in mind. For the price, this is a great value. *I've seen other reviews with complaints about the thin walls and noisy hallways. Luckily for us, we didn't experience any of that. I know we had neighbors on both sides, but other than a door closing, didn't hear a peep.;5;1;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
898;6/5/2009;XiVKABLLuJdc4zeA;xHr52vm-A265XmKguvbrzw;This is a pretty good hotel for the Loop, but I think I came at the wrong time. It was way too crowded, the elevators took FOREVER, and the gym was packed to the gills. It's understandable that the gym and lobby would be busy with a full hotel, but the elevator problem was a real hassle and very frustrating. I waited maybe 25 minutes to only have the elevator finally come, but so jam-packed that I couldn't get on. (Walking down 19 flights in heels didn't appeal to me that day...) Apart from that, the hotel is in a good location, the rooms are clean quiet, and the staff is friendly. Housekeeping responded so quickly when I called about my broken iron, and the front desk gave me great advice on finding a yummy pizza restaurant. Overall, not a bad stay.;4;1;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
899;7/2/2009;ek2XGfAnrd7mPT-N1HNtwg;T9jWAlVTjWI3lyBI8ncBqQ;I'm a fan.  I was looking for a business hotel for one night in central Chicago. First the location is great.  2 blocks from the Blue Line metro stop which runs straight for the airport.  It's close to Millenium Park where I'm going jogging in the morning, and close to the offices of the businesses I'm visiting. The hotel has been recently remodeled and upgraded.  The lobby is plush and comfy:the $109 room I got from http://Kayak.com was clean, modern, although not super big. Surprisingly this was the 2nd least expensive option available.  The cheapest option had abysmal Yelp reviews, everything else for $30 or $40 more didn't have stellar reviews either.  Allegro is a good middle of the road choice for the casual business traveler. What I also liked, and which prompted me to give the 5-start rating, is that they didn't nickle and dime me for things that should be a commodity.  I can't stand it when hotels charge me $10+ for 24 hours of wireless access.  The Allegro has free wireless if you sign up for their (free) customer loyalty program.  That's a fair trade.  Same with things like toothbrushes.  I'm always annoyed when I stay at a $150+ a night place and they charge me $5 for toothpaste.  That's just ridiculous.  The Allegro actually has a list posted in the bathroom of the toiletry items that are free (all the most common ones are) and the ones they charge for like nail clippers.  And the fee is moderate too. Tumbs up also for the fluffy duvets and super comfortable bed. It seems run by conscious people that care about the customer experience.  Recommended.;5;1;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
900;6/13/2008;CQayl0U0OpHw4pHSSOL;YoejZWcd86pa_Nj-Bo8TMA;I'm attaching my review from TripAdvisor. I love this hotel. I just find it very charming. I love the new decor, and the location is great. Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. Valet's good too - there was this guy Chuck at the valet when I stayed here a few months ago and he was just the nicest guy. Haven't seen him the last 2 times I stayed here though. Also ordered room service for breakfast once and it was great. Like others have mentioned, the rooms (and sinks and closets) are definitely smaller, but in my opinion they're enough for 2. I've stayed here with my partner for over a week before and we had everything we needed (although a microwave would have been nice). It just sort of feels like living in New York, you have to be neat and make sure every space is being used. I've also stayed at the King suite before - nice separate living room space, but you can only sleep 1 comfortably on the sofa bed. My friends opted to lay the pillows on the floor and slept on the floor instead. I get the feeling that the hotel doesn't have all its processes down yet. Sometimes I make requests (such as pillows or pet bowls) and they take a long time to be fulfilled. Sometimes it takes multiple reminders, and sometimes it takes me to be proactive by going downstairs to the front desk. They certainly seem to be improving everytime I stay here though. and if anything does go wrong, the staff does its best to remediate the issue, an effort which I am appreciative of. My biggest issue with the hotel is its thin walls. Of my stays here, I've heard neighbors' passionate nights to phone conversations, and I'm not even a light sleeper. My worst experience was when my neighbor decided to wake up to Josh Groban 45 minutes before I wanted to wake up. An unfortunate incident likely resulting from being in an older building, but somehow I still like this hotel a whole lot and keep going back. I now request for quiet rooms in my Kimpton profile, and it seems to have helped in my most recent stay.;4;1;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
901;10/22/2009;8k1J3zkRNkdrusDdIi8dfw;47xVd-iwg90CozEECYhI9A;Thank you for giving me the worst room on the planet. The website for this hotel was so gorgeous that my friends came expecting to be awed...instead what I got was probably the worst room in the entire hotel. It was the size of my college dorm room, the bathroom can be more or less described as an 'efficiency' and my view (way up high on the 10th floor)...brace yourself...was of a parking lot across the street. What made it worse was that it was 2 steps from the elevator so all I heard during the night were the dings of people going up and down. Which brings me up to my next point...I had 2 friends over to watch tv for a few hours before going out and management called my room 4 times to complain about the 'noise level'.  At one point they said 'we are going to have to ask you to leave if this keeps up' ...not a great thing to say to a guest? especially when that guest has to listen to the elevator all night. In summary, this hotel should not be considered a 4 star. I've stayed at holiday inns that were much more quiet, considerate and BIGGER. Maybe they just like to yank my chain because I bought it off of priceline but at this price point, I would've been better off putting up an extra 50 to be pampered, not insulted.;1;1;0;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

The location was good for us.  We didn't hear the El, like another reviewer mentioned.  It wasn't right on the Mile, but that was fine.  We didn't mind walking a bit.  The conceirge was great about giving us restaurant recommendations that turned out to be winners.   Our room here was VERY small with a small bathroom as well.  It was recently redone and everything was lovely.  The bed was incredibly comfortable with high quality sheets and comfy duvets.   I haven't been back but will probably stay there when we return to Chicago.;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

You have to join their Kimpton program, but it's a snap. The rooms are charming, Art Deco-ish, and Euro-sized but that's cool as long as you're not a bigger person.

No worries:I got off on Cumberland and took the streets into downtown.  We pulled up to the Hotel at 7:38PM.  Yeah - I know right?  The doorman and bell person were ON POINT.  We simply hopped out, opened the trucks hatch, they took my last name and our bags, gave us 2 tickets:one for the valet and one to pick up out luggage upon check in.   Nice! We walked 7 seconds to the show next door with NO worries. Upon arriving back at the hotel to check in:we were given double bed rooms on a high floor as requested:small rooms but hell it was efficient.  We ordered room service, laughed loudly with no repercussions from the neighbors or the front desk, and when we went out dancing it didn't take forever for them to bring the wheels around. We all had a great time and would return.;4;0;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

911;9/9/2010;s96qhWbEwqrbbScqmeR6cw;bEf3xvHgeEmRFr6celPgjg;The decor is unique. It's out there - definitely clashing wallpapers , furniture, and colors, but it works. As for the rooms..they're tiny. And the bathrooms are tinier. The sink in the bathroom is awkward because it doesn't have a lot of depth...so washing your face means splashing water on your legs too. Some of us actually opted to wash our faces/brush our teeths in the bathtub because it was less messy. A really important note: THE WALLS ARE SUPER THIN. You can hear everything. Let the staff know - they'll probably comp your room for you.;2;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

913;9/18/2010;5lgycEeA0kL3t1E7AF69ew;N4WlL20Cv5bhqaZymc92ag;The 5-6pm free wine happy hour is getting to be the standard at hotels the world wide.  Hotel Allegro has a gorgeous multi-room lobby space where they offer their version of happy hour and it's definitely what stood out most about my stay.  There's a Wii, which is a great conversation starter and a fun idea in general. After checking in and seeing the lobby I was a bit disappointed by the room.  The decor was nice, but the room was quite small and unfortunately the view, even from the 18th floor, was an eyesore.  But I've come to learn that's pretty much par for the course in Chicago.  Otherwise, the snack bar offered some healthy, organic treats and the toiletries weren't tested on animals which is important to me. The gym is impressive for a hotel and I was able to get a decent workout.  I didn't eat in the attached restaurants in part because the breakfast was outrageously expensive.  A coupon for dinner is provided for the attached restaurant, but I didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  The menu looked decent. I would stay here again and recommend it for sure.  I found a great deal on http://hotels.com, it's in a great location near an L stop and the shopping district on State Street, and I looked forward to coming back to Allegro after work each day.  The only qualm I have is the surcharge to use the internet.  In this day in age, most travelers bring their laptops everywhere they go and it's a common courtesy for any hotel to provide free internet access.;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
914;8/15/2011;7t0S48Hf;my2QdiHb5c9i67otCSL-bA;As a positive the hotel itself is in a decent location, located in the financial district. Keep in mind that a lot of places roll the carpet up at 9pm because of this location. There is a bar next door to the hotel but it was not open on Sunday...or at least the Sunday I was there. The rooms are very small, the decor is nice and everything was very clean. They do not have a restaurant onsite but to offer limited room service. The rooms are equipped  with stocked mini bar and snacks. Wifi is available as well.

915;6/1/2011;BbEJfygLrRCtQH5SBT-i1A;s7lyoCAlevNi5NaslaUwVA;Let me preface by saying I work for a hotel brand that is not Kimpton.  I made last minute plans to head back to Chicago and decided on the Allegro.  Great Choice.  I used to live in Chicago for many years so I know the layout and CTA well so it was nice to have a hotel which was very accessable so that I wouldn't have to rent a car. Like a few other people who booked there, I was expecting a room that was smaller, I guess I'm used to many historic type hotels rooms in NYC which have basically enough room for the bed and a little walking space, nice molding on the walls but not a whole lot of space to walk lol.  I had a premier king room which basically was a king room with a little more space, well, I had plenty of space.  Nice amenities (Aveda), housekeeping is fantastic as they cleaned my room somehow when I wasn't there.  I was impressed because I was in and out throughout my 3 day stay and never saw them in my room.  I was also impressed by the fact that I looked down onto the L tracks but never heard the train.  Maybe I was too immersed in my work but it definately wasn't like some street noise I've encountered at many other hotels.  Room service, the person answering the phone was very thorough and the food was fast, hot and correct.  The hotel is very conveniently located so that if you want to see/go anywhere in the loop you can really walk.  If you need to hop on the L, its centrally located to Wells and the Lake st stops.   Points to help out When you first walk in, there is a flight of stairs which you have to go up to get to the main lobby Definately join InTouch before you check in Use the hotels services ie concierge, fitness room;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Room service was very nice and so was the front desk. The couple of complaints I have are mainly about the room. I was given a mini bar key, but there was no mini bar, wtf? Ok, I can live with no booze...but the room also felt a little grimy and small.  I don't think I'd stay here again, unless I was staying in a clean suite.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
917;8/26/2010;mj9uPvGGSEhcSEeWu;s2-_-92s_IvvGYGOupXGEA;This is a great hotel which is rather unique. The big CON is they have small rooms. It's a renovated older hotel so its not like they designed it this way to begin with but it was rather tight. I, for one, don't mind since I rarely stay in my room that long... I am a up and about type person. For some people, this is a big deal since they need a large room. Don't let that deter you though. The staff here is great. Very helpful, very service minded. They mailed a post card for me an gave me an umbrella when I asked where I could buy one. My friend got upgraded to a suite because they made a small mistake. These are good service minded people. I like the decor but it could be a bit much for some people who like a more traditional feel (Kimpton hotels are mostly like this though, its their thing). As other people have mentioned, they have wine every day for an hour or so. Really really really cool of them. It's also a good way to meet other guests. If you get a deal on this hotel... I'd say check it out.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

923;8/31/2008;vB5RgUHmq9;uqdUPWJVsdWzDHnILxey_g;We went to a wedding here recently, and the food and service were great. Later a few us went up and continued the festivities in a rather nice suite, complete with pool table and bar. My only gripe is with the Nazi doormen.. I understand the laws in Chicago about being 15-feet from the door when smoking, and not having an open container on the street, but you're not a cop, and you know there's a wedding going on. Quit taking out your frustration of having a crap-ass job on your guests. Other than that dickhead, the hotel was really nice.;4;2;1;1;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
924;5/18/2010;SkrFFTXnmjydoa5OAmod5Q;cLePLju2DvpZDw6PNDbMOg;I am a frequent guest of Kimpton Hotels and an "In Touch" member. I have stayed at the Allegro once before, well over a year ago and prior to the massive renovation. The good: - The location is touristy, but convenient. The El is very close by, as are multiple bars and restaurants. - The renovation is definitely a huge improvement. The palette is pleasing and the rooms are much more restful. - The beds are comfortable, as expected at a Kimpton hotel. The bad: - Leave your toiletries at home, because there is absolutely no space to place them in the bathroom. Literally...zero. - The closets are extremely bizarre. They removed the main rack to hang your clothing and replaced it with two face-out racks...you can't see your clothes all at once, as you are forced to stack them on top of each other. Also, you'll find tacky apparel the hotel is trying to get you to purchase, taking up the majority of hangers. - The doormen (with the exception of one, Fidel) are surly and I found this quite annoying. I was told which cab to get into, as though I'd never hailed a cab before (I am from NYC). While approaching the hotel on several occasions, the doormen would yell at me what door to use (there are three, all of which work...) yet not once did they bother to open it for me. Where is the service? - While check-in was pleasant, the woman who checked me out was both rude and abrupt. Not only was I not asked how my stay was, but I was hastily shoved a receipt (no envelope, no review of charges) and shoved aside for another guest who was checking in...at noon. I travel very frequently for business and pleasure and normally have the Kimpton group on the very top of my hotel list. After this horrible experience, I will likely reconsider my loyalty and may make a beeline back to the Starwood group.;2;3;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
925;3/1/2009;DhywqYG4nLitLZKKOm7TCQ;7IxHNhFo-jLtEXawSIffog;A total steal.  In February Kimpton offered $44 off best rate rooms to celebrate the man himself, Obama.  Our room totaled $103/night and despite the reviews, I thought it was spacious enough for a weekend with one other person.  The bathroom was tiny yes, and you can hear *everything* going on in there from the bedroom but hey, it happens.   Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo and conditioner + bath soup and face bar, beautiful and cozy linens and a very attentive staff as I've come to expect from Kimpton!   Great location -- walking distance to Intelligentsia and a few other key spots, and quiet on the higher floors.  I'll definitely be back if there's another deal!   Otherwise, I'm rather anxious to try the other Kimpton spaces in Chicago.;4;1;1;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
926;10/11/2005;E9xu8B6IjysmnVpEmNLFEw;5F_ASUSCHFf3YotkKioZ5w;I would definitely stay here again.  The staff were all very friendly, and it's centrally located - near the el, but chances are you'll walk everywhere.  It's next door to the Ford Cadillac Theatre, and a few other places are nearby - I recommend the Baton Club if you haven't been yet.  Our room was a nice size for the price, the mattress and pillows were new and comfortable.  No oversized tub to hang out in or big fluffy bathrobes - I missed those features.  Good room service food, and be there for the complimentary wine reception in the evenings.  Recently renovated.;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
927;3/17/2011;oXRNJ1cMaVqES2B4mI;7gFRo3jmqhmtRhxquNkZ7Q;Based on the other reviews we were expecting a very small room:this was not really the case. There was plenty of room for a desk, chair, king sized bed, minibar, a closet to put all our luggage in and more. The decor in the room and the lounge was fun and contemporary. The room was super clean and the housekeeping did an excellent job. The hotel has a free concierge and a free wine "social hour."  They were able to hold our luggage for us all day long after we had checked out, also for free. We will be staying here again next time we go to Chicago. Tips: -Lobby is up one floor from ground level in the lounge. It's tricky to find at first. -Coffee is served in the lobby from the morning to 10am, if you are late risers and come to get coffee at 10:10, it will be gone.;4;1;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

THANK GOODNESS. This place is amazing. I stayed in the King Suite. I feel like a King. Ridiculously spacious. Chic and modern, but not comfortable, tasteful, and cozy. Love the blue color theme and music prints and photographs. Two TVs? Why not. Full bathroom including a tub with jets? Yes, please. The service - from the valet to the front desk - is fantastic. And the small details: the swanky zebra print bathrobes, the fast and free internet, the extensive in-room dining menu. Within 5 minutes of entertaining the room, the decision was made: not gonna bother leaving the room. It's that nice and comfortable. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'd look here in a heartbeat.

936;6/17/2009;VyENP0GuAVYdEwNVDDd;UVfY84Rxw3EFTIAJT_Z5lQ;I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel. Very cool updated interior design and fixtures. I'm sure this is an old building but you wouldn't know it by the looks. I was super happy to find I could strut around my room in a cheetah, yes CHEETAH robe while my man wore his zebra robe. These are also available for sale along with a set of cheetah PJs (his and hers) and some cozy socks which were in our closet, just in case. The mini bar is extensively stocked with not only beverage and snacks but also things you may need like toothbrushes, razors and even a "love kit", all for purchase if needed. These items were quality brands and eco-friendly in most cases which was nice. The shampoo and lotions were Aveda which also made me happy, they just smell great and have great products. I actually liked their towels, most hotels even some of the better ones have inconsistent and possibly scratchy towels that make you paranoid that you might get stuck with the itchy one. These were consistently plush and didn't reek of bleach. My only negative would be the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The chic table-top sink on a granite counter just doesn't lend enough space for your toiletries but we managed by shuffling the hotels accessories around and using the back of the toilet. I must give kudos to the front desk for upgrading our room to a slightly larger room for free, we booked as a package deal on Orbitz. We tried to purchase an upgrade for the jet tub room but they didn't have any available. Didn't eat there so I can't speak to that, but the area is in the theatre district and close to some good eats. We also had a great corner view room and could see straight down one of the streets (??) and not just at a window of another building which is often your view in a big city. Great hotel, great service, helpful nice people, elevators were fast. I'd go again!;5;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

At first glance, you figured it couldn't be too bad as a Kimpton.  The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent.  However, the rooms just sucked.  Imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size. Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size.  The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell.  The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college.  The paints peeling on the base boards, the carpet is new, but something is wrong. I would stay at the Marriott, Renaissance, Westin, or any where else.;1;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
938;7/24/2009;nm;30pdSsDpnItiXC-_1009Tw;Ok...so this place isn't for anyone and I hated it when I first walked in.  By the time I left, I'd gotten used to the place and even kind of forgot some of the negatives.  It was an average stay. Room size for several rooms is EXTREMELY small.  I think they tried to do what they could with what they had.  It is, after all, a vintage 1926 building.  I was extremely disappointed with the room size, and, at first, put off by the decor.  My eyes eventually settled and adjusted though.  Also, it seems to make sense with the boutique theme of the hotel. On the positive, the service was good but uneven at times.  "Superbad" at the counter was wonderful and even showed my friend and I a bigger room because we had asked to see one.  Other front desk folks were average to below average for a four star place.  I never used the concierge.  The doormen were friendly and helpful.  Location is good.  Readily accessible to the Washington/Wells station on the "L".  Also several bus lines run nearby.  You are literally next door to Chicago City Hall and in the same building as the Cadillac Theatre and a few minutes walk from the iconic Chicago Theatre and the Oriental Theatre.  You're about a 10-15 minute walk from the Willis Tower and about two blocks south of the Chicago River.   The free wine is a great amenity nightly, and they bring some nice appetizers over from the 312 Chicago...a restaurant that is co-located in the building.  The food was good (had room service breakfast) and the amenities were enjoyable.   Beds were nice and comfy.  Showers good and powerful.  The housekeeping crew was tremendously nice and helpful.  The place is brand new and clean having just been renovated last year. Negatives?  The wireless internet was a continuous problem.  Two days, it worked fabulously, and two days it just plain was un-usably slow.  I had to go down to the lobby.  The maintenance crew barged in on me after two quick knocks one day.  I get why they did it, but I still don't get the decor for sure.  It's such a mismash of things.  My bathroom in my room was very small.  The sink was very odd, too.  It tended to allow water to swash out everywhere. If you're expecting a run-of-the-mill hotel experience, go to the Holiday Inn.  This is a boutique hotel, and it will not appeal to everyone.  I appreciate what Kimpton is trying to do with this property.  It's definitely a different experience than I've ever had at another hotel.   I might take another shot at the Allegro with another room someday.  Fun and disappointment mixed together for an average stay.;3;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

940;7/26/2010;UT6d36Pub-y0mgh5yUgTzg;fHlpCeBFK-LkBlANjxWurQ;Hotel Allegro was recently one of the featured spots on Jetsetter (http://jettsetter.com, a discount travel site featuring high end hotels) and was available for a weekend when I was planning on being in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We got a fantastic rate and I am probably being more forgiving than other travelers may be based on the fantastic deal that we received. The hotel is located in the Loop, Chicago's main business district. As a one time Chicagoan, this location worked great for me, but other people may find that a property off the Magnificant Mile is more ideal. Upon check in, we were given complimentary drink vouchers because we had missed their nightly complimentary wine happy hour in the lobby. Our room had a very retro feel and was clean, but was also very small. Most of the room was occupied by the very comfortable king bed. We had some small issues with both the safe and our AC, but the hotel sent people up very quickly to help with both and they were easily resolved. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, but only to people traveling for business, single travelers,  or those who plan on spending very little time in their rooms.;4;1;2;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
941;9/8/2008;WuEvHZeoB6cVeCH2nFTHKA;V-yIfSONUQeQiPToS8muZg;Well, I have spent now 3 weeks at this hotel for work.  The bed is pretty comfy, the TV is big, the channels are OK, the rooms are really small!  The staff is quite helpful - ask for extra pillows!  Be sure to try the Encore bar on the first floor, the food is good and tasty - as well with room service.  Location is convenient but know that the Loop goes dead on the weekends.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
942;8/19/2012;DL-B74X5Tgbu;xSwEg9th_V6nEBgkdUb2CQ;My husband and I had our wedding here and we are so happy and thrilled we did.   First of all, the entire staff was so nice and accommodating.  We had several room change requests and they always did what they could and gave us the biggest rooms possible.  The hotel itself is very stylish, clean, and hip!   My wedding went so smoothly.  We had the world's best catering sales manager (Alison) who was so patient with me, and I truly consider her a friend now.  Our food was amazing.  We heard so many compliments on the food.  But most importantly, the space is so romantic and breathtaking.  It really is impressive. Please feel free to message me if you are considering having a wedding here.  I would be happy to answer any questions.;5;1;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
943;8/14/2012;OuXHIZ7emxW0AMpvVQ1;ZsoFfx6T6Jb36_gfF15PNQ;This place has a very fun and fantastical feel to it when you walk in:you definitely feel a little like Alice in Wonderland. When I've had a frumpy day, I like to go here to class up my night :p I've had nothing but good service from the waitresses to the concierge. I work in the Loop so I go to the W for drinks sometimes after. I stayed here with a friend for a "stay-cation" a few months ago and I was appalled by the size of the room! I literally think my jaw dropped. The bathroom, on the other hand, was generously sized. Weird. We really just needed a place to crash after drinking but had I been staying here on a real vacation, I would have made reservations elsewhere!;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
944;8/7/2012;HyC-RWURTjS-XCnEcWUL9g;YomNW639BgIcOMwuS9LHcg;It's a nice looking hotel, but the rooms are small and the bathroom is tiny...The location is great if you're wanting to check out the sites downtown as it's only a short walk or cab ride to quite a few attractions if you're from out of town.  It's a little pricey but what can you expect when you're downtown at the W.   I was disappointed that when we checked in our room wasn't ready and that was after 4pm.  We had to take a walk and eat lunch before the room was ready so almost an hour went by before we could actually go to the room.   Another disappointment was the view.  Lovely rooftop.  =);2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
945;7/10/2012;M5ejbkUf24bugmw69J6;ylnlAS9bCbxEcPRfxuhJCQ;This truly is an exceptional W.  It screams all the things that a W should scream: style, innovation, comfort, sexiness and charm.  The lobby itself is ethereal, and even if you're not staying here, drop in and check it out.  The lobby, however, does turn into a cluster. The property must've been full during my stay because there was barely room to move and walking to the elevators required some Gladiator moves. The Fabulous Room is, in fact, fabulous.  Incredibly spacious, comfy, sexy and chic. Really impressive decor and equally impressive functionality: bed, work desk, etc. Staff is helpful, halls are quiet, didn't hear a sound in my room the entire time even though I know they were sold out. Lastly, close to lots of stuff - ideal location in Chicago, in my opinion.  I hope to be able to stay here again.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
946;7/2/2012;fMRp7wCHeYwA2OcXdg9DnA;YEPthSMeeeFEITZnjSmkbA;I have always loved the W hotels, but this one was.. decent but not the most amazing W hotel I have stayed at. The reason I say this is because the rooms are really way to small - at least the Cozy rooms were. The room itself was also slightly old. You can tell from the walls and doors even though the decor in the rooms was modern. The bathroom was also way too small. There really was no space to move at all and this was the same with the spacing between the desk and the bed. It was very difficult to even slide the desk chair out. Another thing that bothered me during the stay was the fact the walls are paper thin. The room next to mine was definitely throwing a party and unfortunately, I could hear the television and the screaming pretty clearly. While the rooms themselves were cramped and older, the overall hotel decor was magnificent. The lobby was beautiful along with the second floor of the hotel - it'd be a great place to throw a party or event. I just wished that the spaciousness of the public areas applied to the guest rooms. The hotel service was pretty good though. I ordered late night room service and even though the kitchen messed up the order, they immediately sent up a different late night entree (on the house) and said that I can order whatever I like for breakfast the next day free of charge. My boyfriend and I definitely took advantage of that one and W Hotel did not say a word about it. Internet was also complimentary during our stay so that was definitely a plus. On another positive note, the location of the hotel couldn't be better so it was definitely very convenient to get around.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
947;6/15/2012;cN;GXfrchFxdldoJXSEqUcdNw;Not a fan at all. 1.) Noisy- next to the L. One day there was also amplified music outside at 6AM which woke me up- told management but they did not seem to care 2.) Generally good service (most folks really tried) but had the front desk get snarky with ,me for their screw-up, separately  eff up my reservation, and make me wait about 20 mins to check out on a third occasion.   3.) Ws are great for hipsters- they're not great if you're traveling for business. Little things (like think lights that are actually bright) just aren't there 4.) This part of town is dead after dark, so don't expect to walk to dinner unless you're not picky. 5.) The gym sucks even by hotel gym standards For the price, not worth staying here. Marriott, I think I'm coming back!;2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
948;5/21/2012;t-Ei0mASa4uNrezbwFot0Q;UgFW_QEhfFmzXjO2bZc5nA;This place is unique and great. I was here for 5 days and had I been at a lesser hotel, it would have really worn me out by the end. Instead, the bed was so fantastic that I slept like a baby and didn't really feel the traveling effects that set in after day 2. My only complaint is that the bathroom was tiny. I mean, really, really small. When I sat down on the toilet, I had to rest my arm on the top of the sink because I was so squished. GREAT place;4;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

950;5/13/2012;A;0GvJHXKM6p03h_fDNLI46Q;I love W hotels. This one is definitely not my favorite one. We opted for this one over lakeshore to get two rooms for a bachelorette party in April because I was able to get a better airline industry rate at this one. The rooms are quite small. The girl at the front desk was helpful she was able to get us connecting rooms. However, we had to turn one of our rooms from a one king to a one queen. I didn't even realize such a thing as a one queen bed room existed but ok...the rooms were the exact same size except in the king you didn't really have much walking room. Also note, the king room didn't have a real door on the bathroom but a sliding one that was pretty see through. Can be a bit uncomfortable.... However, my main issue with this hotel was the lobby smelled BAD. It kind of smelled like sewage. They were doing construction across the street which may have caused it but either way it was gross.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
951;2/12/2012;Tf7iqKL2Jk3AVufvp6Ucig;4VbB9qS2Xvk-bjAI1bNlGw;This is like a traditional W hotel's attractive, quieter, hard-to-get-to-know sister. The W City Center is still a bit of an enigma to me and I have stayed there several times.  The first time I booked this hotel, I was surprised by its location, but drawn in by the name, I made the reservation and hoped for the best.  Honestly, it is not as bad as some of the SPG hotels that I have stayed in, but it doesn't have the redeeming qualities of the other Ws.   The thing about a typical W hotel is that beyond all of the pretentiousness is excellent service and cleanliness.  This W has the cleanliness, but none of the excellent service.  Most of the service I got boarded on you-are-interrupting-me-checking-into-foursquare-­under-the-table looks and uninformed service on the phones. They usually have better pricing than the other Ws, but you won't get the benefits that come with the extra dollars.  By "extras", I mean basic customer service.;3;11;6;3;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
952;7/9/2012;YnTNqnIracH;CjWrHGIguk-1wf3z2bDsrQ;From all the hotels I have stayed at (everything from the W to the St. Regis), this particular hotel ranks #1 when it comes to concierge and front desk service. 1. Bill, who works front desk, certainly went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check-in, I made a request for a top floor room with a view of the city. Bill was more than obliged to get accommodate my request. However, when I got into my room, the view was only a building. Ironically, a few minutes later, Bill called and wanted to make sure if the view was to my liking. While the room was very spacious and in the corner of the hotel, I admitted to him that the view was not to my taste. Bill then decided to call me back in a few minutes so he could look over the hotel layout in order to find me the perfect room. A few minutes later, he called back and presented me with a room that could be a hit/ miss. Not only did he come up personally to show me the room, but he also brought up the new keys and offered to carry my bags. This by far is the best "above and beyond" experience I have ever encountered. Major props to Bill! 2. Concierge was awesome! Eden was very sincere and helpful when it came to planning my brunch/ sightseeing. She also gave me her business card and hand wrote her name on the card so I could give to the hostess at the cafe, in order to be 1st on the list. Concierge connections such as that definitely brings value to rate! Thank you, Eden! 3. Stephen Bee (manager on duty), thank you! I want to personally thank you for listening to my feedback and recognizing the W-Team. Your follow-up e-mail was also very much appreciated! Thank you once again and kudos to Bill, Eden, and Stephen!;5;0;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
953;4/30/2012;Q0i0JhMZxp3ng9Iz4jReVA;q3bgmbZwwBf-mmIT28-9WQ;If given the option, stay at the JW Marriot directly across the street from the W. That is, if you care about the quality of the gym, the room service options and the room. The W gym (I was there just this morning) is a dingy gross room with VERY OLD equipment. 3 treadmills: This morning one was broken completely, one was locked on chinese language and shook violently when operated and one worked. 2 very old ellipticals, 2 old bikes and 1 weird cardio machine that must have been free b/c no one would ever use it. The guy next to me described the place as a "dungeon" and we both were just disgusted. The JW Marriot, on the other hand, has a gorgeous and clean workout facility.  The machines are new and the place is just clean. The W is downright dirty. Oh, and the wipey towels were totally dried out so clearly are never used. The room service menu is very limited. The restaurant is weird and expensive. Bottom line: If you can stay at the JW, you should. The W is a dump.;1;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
954;7/11/2012;jEyUQY3BC5Ryr2tee70ahA;SKBIYwc40Fp89cbCXcC0bw;This place is very nice!  I loved my stay here and will use it again if I ever find a need.  Finding the building is not difficult and there is plenty of parking around if you need it.  Or if you're taking the L, there are many stops in the area to catch it.  Checking in was easy and the staff was very nice and courteous.  As I took the elevator up to the room, the walls had a almost trippy 3D effect that was cool.   The room was very trendy and very clean.  The room was fairly small but adequate for only needing to sleep and leave belongings there.  For those who travel for business, this room would work well since there is a desk with any and every kind of connection you would need to work or charge an kind of tech piece.  The linens in the room were white and the decor was well done.  My absolute favorite part of staying here was the bed and pillows.  So soft!  You kind of just sink in to a cloud.  Very comfortable and relaxing.  I want those pillows! The next morning I went down to the lobby to ask the concierge about a breakfast spot I had heard about, and she was very helpful and gave a great recommendation.   Overall I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to any of my friends.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
955;8/16/2012;rTpj6BQbdAWUdhkY;qkHcXx890CkQn3uXAU0F_g;I'm using the W's $15 a day internet to tell you that, I have only been at the hotel for 30 minutes, and I already know I will not be returning to any W hotel or recommending this hotel to anyone who comes to Chicago to stay. When I came to the front desk to check in, I told the person at the front desk my name, gave him my drivers license and credit card.  The guy tells me that he can't check me in because my husband made the reservation and "forgot" to list me on the reservation (in actuality my husband made the reservation on a third party site that didn't tell him he should list other people staying with him).  I had my 4 month old son with me and he was getting fussy because he was hungry, I had all my luggage with computer and expensive stuff sitting out in the middle of the lobby, and my last name is the same as my husbands last name on my drivers license, and I am wearing an obvious wedding ring.  And this jerk is telling me to go sit in the lobby until I can get ahold of my husband at work during a busy workday because it is "company policy".  It made me feel just awful, like why did we bother paying extra money to stay at this fancy-pants hotel if they are going to treat me like I'm trying to break in because I didn't follow their stupid rule exactly right? I get that the W doesn't want people sneaking into their hotel and it's a safety concern... but come on.  How often do people with babies, lots of luggage, and the same last name as someone who has a reservation fake their way into a hotel?  And, what would have been so bad about checking me in, and asking me for my husbands number so he could confirm the reservation?  You gotta give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes!   They upgraded us to a room with a king bed from 2 twin beds, but, really, I don't care if they had upgraded us to a suite with five rooms and a Jacuzzi, or if they have the nicest bar and restaurant in the city, the damage has been done.  You gotta treat your guests right, and this guy did not.  He ruined my stay and made me feel like crap, and I'm never coming back to this hotel again or recommending it to anybody to stay in (and I live in Chicago and recommend hotels to people a lot). In case a manager at the W reads this and wants to know who the front desk jerk was, the dude's name was Steve, he was a tall guy with glasses and brown hair.;1;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

You give it to Starwood Hotels. TK - Our concierge did such an amazing job. Transferred our bags from the Westin Ohare, were we had to stay for one night cause the whole town was booked, having complementary beer in a bucket of ice and snacks when we came back from the trade show, SO NEEDED!!!!. Running down to CVS to get meds for us and all weekend car service. I will never stay anywhere if I can help it.;5;0;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
957;1/9/2012;S9qVDDzQEZsEtKCHqoOJWA;Wb5Gs_FpWDYjrhn0luPd3A;I've never stayed at a W Hotel before and we decided to on this occasion, because surprisingly enough, it was the cheapest rate. Upon entering the lobby, you do feel like entering a club. You may even miss the small check-in area to your left as your distracted by the seats in the center and all the people lounging around. Service was really friendly and efficient. I was impressed at how nice the girl behind the counter was. When we got to our room, we were so surprised. There was so much room (even in the bathroom!). Coming from NY, you're not used to a lot of room where you can spread out. Our room had plenty of walking room and a one person couch as well as desk. The only thing I wasn't pleased about was that you could hear the train from our room. I'm not sure if every room was like this or if we were just closer, but even at 4:30 AM (when I started drafting this) I've heard the train go by many times. Make sure you bring some ear plugs and maybe that'll help? Location is good and I would definitely stay here or at another W Hotel! We used the complimentary Acura car service they offer and that was pleasant (they offer a one time usage of a car ride within a 5 mile radius). I loved the Bliss products as well!;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
958;10/31/2011;1HZCiip4ugSMHUhv2CsWWg;JoBG5PFSFKVOUdTbli-hEg;The hotel has quite the club feel on the first floor. Check in desk is in the back left hand corner and there is really no where to wait. A big mix of concierge desks, elevators and check in staff. I would also have liked to know in advance that they place a $200 hold on your credit card. Made for a surprise when I checked my accounts. Overall, too trendy, not practical, not even sexy. Whoever thought these particular bathroom sinks were cute was right -- but they should also consider function. No way to wash your hands, face or brush your teeth. It was preposterous actually. How you maneuver to accomplish those tasks was beyond me. Really bad water pressure too. The room was clean...but carpet just felt dirty. Please tell me that this building was once something else and re-purposed for a hotel. Otherwise, the layout just does not make sense. Bliss products were the best part.;2;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
959;9/9/2011;xIk18bXBHHEqMOhmsjKBoA;1U7NkJJ_MEfD1fGRMgtTJQ;Honestly, this is really a 3 star hotel.  I gave it the additional star because the concierge gave us a magic card that put us at the top of a VERY long wait list at Yolk for brunch the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Fairly recent renovations, decent check-in staff, Bliss amenities..... We had two "Superior" rooms.  Tons of room.  Nice bathrooms.  I typically stay elsewhere when I'm in the city, but it was great for what we were doing. We did drinks and apps at IPO, the restaurant in the hotel.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL.  Everyone was very helpful.  The drinks and apps were great.  I'd definitely try some dinner there next time I'm in town.;4;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
960;11/6/2011;8n8IvrR23ZnY4GZAm5An9g;7lUexXeJodkYmeV5GZGRwA;Like all of the other W properties, I love the Acura "driving experience" chauffeur service (although the times at this property are rather limited). The rooms were spacious, a little bit bare/empty.  There was a pocket sliding door from the room to the bathroom.  If you're visiting as a new couple, keep in mind that the bathroom doesn't provide much "sound privacy". I love how they kept the old fashioned mail drop by the elevators. Lobby was very noisy.  Check-in area was rather small. I was there for an event, the 2nd level "foyer" has weird ceiling heights, so keep that in mind when planning!;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
961;6/2/2011;VNdZD-TFP4ZMZ5NZvlqKNg;e6QRXwwzhebaLVX0JEztpg;Didn't have a good experience here.  Granted I booked late, and so I paid a very high rate (around $450) and they still put me in this tiny room that makes solitary confinement look comfortable.  They called it a "Cozy Room" or something like that.  The front desk attendant offered me some snacks to make up for it, and they never arrived.  I called the front desk to ask and they promised they'd send them up.  Never arrived. I can't tell you how awful the room was.  I couldn't use the restroom as my knees were too long and hit the sink.  I had to leave the bathroom to dry off.  It was not possible to sit at the desk as the bed bumped into the table.  Really awful experience. I'm only giving it a second star because I know the rest of the hotel is much nicer, but be careful what room you get.;2;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
962;4/5/2011;SiYNSN5Wqm7LKkFos6CSfw;HNyf_vxCm-mMfrwhQbNBJQ;Nice hotel.  GREAT location in regards to being able to walk everywhere.  The bar when I was there had some sort of party going on in it, like maybe a birthday party or something and there didn't seem to be any waitresses around to get my drink order but I didn't really care that much because I was simply waiting on a friend to pick me up.  I utilized bag check on my day of checkout and when I went to get my bag the attendant was very prompt.  He was right on it.   The room was very nice and rather large.  Huge bathroom, standard W bed (very comfortable), enormous television.  Seriously, I am not sure that I have ever seen THAT big of a TV in a hotel room before.  LOL   I found the rooms in this while less light filled than the other location to be just as nice and much much larger than the other W hotel. They both have some catching up to do though if I were to compare to either the W Boston or the W Seattle.   I did not try out the restaurant as I was only there one night and arrived late.  Also, there are so many really great restaurants in Chicago that I have yet to try that I, more than likely, will never eat in my hotel's restaurant.  Well, unless I stay at the Burnham sometime.  :)   I stayed at the other Chicago W location back in December as well.  That one had a much better view but the location for this one in my opinion is better.  This location tends to run better specials too in regards to room rates.;4;2;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

We just 5 days and all interaction with W staff from the front door, check-in and any staff encountered in halls & elevators was wonderful, any requests we made were answered with "sure, no problem or we'd be happy to" We were upgraded on arrival and our room was spacious, very well appointed and had a super comfy bed & pillows. The location was perfect for the Marathon, and the hotel really catered to the participants with goodie bags of Gatorade & bananas as well as laying out food & coffee for all in the lobby at 5am the morning of the race. I have to mention the Concierge staff and particularly Vanessa, she was instrumental in making our stay in Chicago a wonderful experience, we really can't say enough about how well we were taken care of. The hotel has a great vibe one of the better W Living Rooms and the location allowed us a few block walk to catch the CTA Blueline to and from ORD.

965;1/16/2011;iD6FYjcyKeoH2vmdddJvHg;9U30DANobkrn3Zlu6T9p6Q;Quick Thoughts: - lobby is one of the best W lobby's anywhere if you're into that sort of thing...hotel bar as expected is solid - bed fell short of W standards and sucked compared to the average Westin bed - typical W gym - small, but does the trick (towels in the fridge is a great call) - internet speed in the room was great (based on wireless - they have both wireless and wired) is 1Mb/s down and .26 Mb/s up - billing was annoying given the ridiculous deposit - 40 SPG stays in the past 2 years and this was the 1st time I've had a hassle - staff is great - from room service to check in The W is 4 stars compared to most other hotels, but 3 stars compared to the better hotels I've stayed in the Chitown (Conrad, Blackstone, etc...).;3;2;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
966;2/28/2012;Bg5;nH9FtM8oAvBAw8EXjkXHxw;I normally stay at W hotels during my vacations, so I selected this one in Chicago.  I was expecting the normal wherever, whenever service and trendy decorated chic rooms, lobbies and bars.  What I didn't expect was personalized service.  Before my arrival, I was greeted by Laurelin via email inquiring if I needed anything during my stay.  I let her know it was my birthday.  She responded immediately that she would like to offer some complimentary gifts on behalf of the W since I am a platinum member and also asked if I needed help with reservations at restaurants for my birthday  night.  Laurelin went above and beyond the "wherever whenever" slogan during my entire stay.  Even though we already had reservations, she called hostesses to reconfirm our reservations for both the restaurant and nightclub to ensure a hassle-free evening.  Additionally, she came to personally greet me after check-in.  Because of her efforts, me and my girlfriends had an amazing time. It was not just Laurelin that provided outstanding service.  We were asking where we could find a 7-11 and the doorman offered to go for us since it was freezing outside!  Another time, we were in a hurry to get food so they helped us get into the Acura car and called ahead to the restaurant to let them know we were coming and needed to be served quickly! At the W you are not paying for a nice hotel, you are paying for the outstanding service.  Laurelin really provided this and ensured that we had a memorable weekend.;5;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
967;3/31/2006;qYaDzPhfHBkJZdfmJj5CPA;nkN_do3fJ9xekchVC-v68A;My worst W experience ever. 1. Went to check in at 11 pm, no one at the desk had to call the hotel from my cell (while standing at the counter) to get someone to the desk. 2. Didn't have a food menu in my room. Called to get a menu, after a 10 minute delay they called back to say there was no one around to bring me one. The receptionist had to dictate the menu over the phone. 3. WiFi is free in the lobby and $15/day in your room. So if you want to be comfortable and relaxed you have to pay a ridiculous fee. 4. I was woken up by maintenance work on a neighboring room at 8am on my first day. I talked to the manager and he claimed it was work being done by the city (outside). I disagreed because I had a room that wasn't facing the street, but gave up since he offered no compensation what-so-ever and sure enough on day 2 the maintenance guys were working on the room next door at 8am again. 5. The heater in my room was ancient and barely worked. Fortunately, it wasn't all that cold during my stay. I'm not sure if I'll ever trust the W again, but certainly if you're thinking of staying at a W in Chicago make sure it's not this one.;1;17;2;2;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

969;7/30/2007;wSe;c9PwtsNozIxJ5NDMT5C9qQ;Personally, I am not a fan of the W Hotels.  Personally, they try too hard. They love to deck out their lobbys, put velvet plum pillows on top of beds, adorn their bathrooms with Bliss products, make sure music playing when you get back to your room, and play out all the Hotel Costes chillout-esque music possible in their lounges.  But their service is crap, and you know when the service is crap the hotel's pretty crap also no matter how nice it is.  Which is why it's so ironic they have their infamous "Whatever. Whenever." motto.  They don't stand by it.   Anyway, besides that, my stay was nothing special.  Yeah the room's nice but gosh every time you flush the toilet you feel like you're flushing an airplane toilet:talk about high pressure.  Then you wonder if the rooms around you can hear you and you feel bad at the same time if you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, which brings me back to the service.  They're so lazy they don't want to bother having plumbers on staff to fix a clogged toilet so they equip each room with the highest pressure toilet they can find.  Genius.;2;4;2;2;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
970;8/26/2009;59mZBIZUNNQqvi4rlf1nkw;ck_-Ms-O5kKYqcEVqufBLw;DON'T. EVER. STAY. HERE. OK, I said it.  I arrived at this hotel for business last week.  From the beginning, customer service was terrible.  The guy up front snickered that I didn't have any Starwood points.  I asked if he could help, because all my points are being diverted to Delta.  Sadly, no. My room was tiny, even by Chicago standards, the bathroom so cramped and crowded that my makeup fell into the toilet.  The bed had a glowing light underneath that I couldn't figure out how to turn off.  I had to sleep with the light on. The water got turned off one day into the trip.  Hotel staff offered me a Fuji water to compensate for the fact that my co-worker and I could not flush our toilet, brush our teeth, or take a shower.  Gee, thanks. We arrived back at the hotel at 6pm to find the water still turned off.  Front desk arranged for a transfer to W Lakeshore but was not courteous at all.  The woman I spoke to refused to let me speak to her manager.  We moved to another hotel and I complained to Starwood corporate.  The hotel compensated me some points, but the whole experience was way horrendous.;1;4;1;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
971;11/15/2009;uShX3vl8E7VKFz1TVSk3hg;JSQrvnnkcowbmViaVfpP0A;After a conference in Chicago, I moved to the W to stay the weekend.  It was an o.k. choice.  It's a great location and the aestetics are very typical for a W hotel.   It's located in a historic building and they juxtapose that with modern design.  The lobby and Lobby Bar are nice with lots of  little niches for your group to have cocktails.  They also have the world's largest table lamps!   The rooms are small, but fine for Chicago.  And, the walls are a VERY thin.  I had to call security on our neighbors who were have "Dance Party USA" at 2 a.m.  But, the hotel sent someone up to talk to them right away and it stopped. All in all, the customer service and room were very nice.  We did have a problem when we requested movies for our room...a standard service.  They didn't have any of the four we asked for.  If they are going to offer a service, they need to be able to provide it.   I cashed in points to stay here and would stay here again.;3;4;2;3;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
972;10/30/2010;u2SrrNcwTh3FYlmt3WdLAw;dBBVtn98mdEV35BvAHfvRQ;I really liked this hotel.  They definitely have consistent theme at the W.  You have to trudge through the nightclubby lobby to check in.  If you're checking in late after a long flight, that can be annoying. I literally thought I was hallucinating in the elevator, but once checked into my room I was pleasantly surprised.  The space was, clean, minimal and comfortable.  While l loved the bathroom, the sink was a design failure.  I spilled a ton of water out of the basin, it was a mess!   The lobby is a great area to hang out and the architecture is stunning.  Loved how they embraced it while keeping the decor funky in  classic W fashion.  I found the service to be very helpful and accommodating as well.;4;2;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
973;7/9/2007;Ha4wq03CAFfWYK9w0JkOsQ;be8hFRSzakhqt37ojP308g;My cousin had her wedding reception here last summer, and holy crap what a shitstorm it was. For one, the food was cold. Every last bit of food was cold. This includes soup, salmon, and fillet mignon - all of which, last I checked, should be at least above room temperature. At least I was served, though. Some tables on the other side of the room never got food, even though my cousin laid out very specific floor plans as to how many of each type of entree each table received. That's just atrocioius, who ever heard of a big fancy hotel not feeding all of its wedding guests? There are two bars, set up in tremendously inconvenient corners of the ball room, so that in order to grab a jack and coke, you had to squeeze yourself between a few tables and knock into about 15 people on your way. The wedding was a Greek wedding, so the reception followed in kind, with a lot of Greek dancing. One of these dances involves the relatives of the bride and groom throwing money at the new couple. Hotel staff was all too quick to sweep up this money on the floor and pocketed quite a bit of it (according to my cousin, anyway). The hotel is lovely:the lobby is modern and gorgeous, and if I were celebrating an anniversary or something, I'd have no qualms about booking a room here. But I'll be damned if I ever think about throwing a large important event here.;2;3;1;2;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
974;12/5/2006;eDXaoZYX34pKPYjZCIe3cg;o5wgBiwaQqGKPpMszzsQpQ;My company had it's Christmas party in the city:so not to drive drunk we got a room here. I believe the mediocre staff gets paid to be aloof.  The house music from 1982 playing in the lobby is a little annoying and what's with the disco ball?  The rooms are small, really small.  The closets are in the bathroom, you have to close the bathroom door to open the closet door.  They DO NOT HAVE FOX NEWS on their cable line-up.  This hotel is for the wannabe, "Sex and the City" set.  I prefer to stay at the Peninsula. Whiskey Blue bar is cool.  If you're a fiddy sumthing rich dood looking for arm candy.;1;3;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
975;9/5/2008;rZOlURa6V4GIAc3NbwAx2Q;-_mjUGB48tMsE3qkljh7Jg;I agree with Claire H.:the lemon drops are yummy here.  We had that and cookies and milk...a roomful of booze in the lounge and we ordered...yup...a plate of chocolate chip cookies and a tall glass of milk to share!  Before going to bed... the rooms are a bit small here...but we loved the rain showerhead... We didn't really pay much attention to the price...I was there for work.  The staff was super nice....;4;2;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
976;5/16/2008;fm86CMGA;QG13XBbgHWydzThRBGJtyw;In every way but the service, this is a three-star W.  After staying at the Lakeshore location with its drool-worthy views and conveniently located Bliss spa, the City Center one was just kind of eh.   That said, the staff did everything they could, both before and during my stay, to make sure I was happy.  I e-mailed the manager to ask for a quiet room and request a room upgrade.  Done!  The Spectacular room was definitely a great size for a room in the middle of a big city, and I loved playing with the big squishy plum-shaped pillow. Other pluses: * Fantastic lemon drop in the lobby bar (it was $14, but it came with a pint-size martini shaker full of lemon drop on the side, so it was really more like two $7 martinis) * Super close to the Blue Line El stop (so convenient to O'Hare!) * Better-than-average room service food * Late checkout * iPod sound dock Although I still prefer the Lakeshore for its views and lack of train noise, the City Center was definitely a pleasant surprise based on some of the negative reviews I read here.;4;2;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
977;1/26/2009;LOgdU4rwlUjZKOMrDhvXgQ;BPkM2rnhMO68Le6Xs-7eVg;Nothing to write home about. Standard W rooms, noisy as hell with the L running right around the building  Your typical service and W lounge/lobby down below. Next time I am in Chicago I am in no hurry to stay here. Oh and guess what if you aren't staying down here for business there is nothing much around;2;2;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
978;11/22/2008;85dVWs1hgea4M3xFb;o3bME_zlxP4Xqr0AVy9eqQ;"Whatever, whenever!"  What a lovely motto for a hotel chain! I'm loving my stay here, it's one of the few bright spots of the week.  At first I was incredibly nervous, I had booked this place for a dozen executives and lawyers and I was afraid that it would be a little too funky for them.   The lobby, while very cool, is like walking into a night club.  It didn't make the greatest first impression on the people I needed to impress.  But that was the only speed bump.  From that moment on, the absolute attention to service and detail has been amazing.  Literally, pick up a "whatever, whenever phone" and they'll "grant your wish" as soon as possible.  The staff at this hotel has made all of our stays wonderful.  They've taken a lot of stress out of my life, and I'm grateful for that. If you're a lawyer coming into the area, the W is also incredibly close to the Federal Court House, which is why I picked the hotel.  We've been able to get back to our hotel, have lunch and a little breather during the short lunches and breaks that we've had throughout the week. Great location and excellent service, hands down. As for the lobby / nightclub.  While my bosses may have thought it was "too distracting" I was very happy to stroll through there every evening.  Made me feel like I was taking a short break from all the craziness.  And the waitresses...  (sigh);5;2;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
979;5/4/2010;vb7As5to7kfKa7NrlB4ZTQ;XYSDrIef7g4Gmp3lNFVO6A;First time ever staying at a "W" Hotel. The hotel has very different vibe - dark, yet lit here and there with a strange mix of futuristic and hip elements. The front check in desk glows with a pink-ish light as you approach. The elevators have a wild 3D-ish material on the walls. The room was on the 6th floor - and somewhat small - very clean and modern. The desk felt like it belonged on The Jetsons. The bed has a night light system beneath the bed - so it sort of glows. Their was a flat panel HD screen mounted on the wall - BUT no HD channels. The bathroom in my room was tiny. But clean, well maintained, and serviceable. The big fail for the room was the AC unit. It was rather stuffy when I arrived. I turned on the AC and it never really cooled off - it just blew air the entire time. I advised the front desk at check out about the AC unit. The hotel staff were friendly and personable. The evening I arrived the Concierge advised me on eating establishments with walking distance. Beware: If you arrive on a Sunday and need to get to a Drug Store - please note you are in downtown Chicago - all Drug Stores around the hotel are closed. I ended up walking a very long seven or so blocks to a 24 hour Walgreens down off of South Halstead Street. There is a McDonald's next door, a Starbucks across one street, and a Dunkin' Donuts catty corner across the intersection - so you do have alternative breakfast options if you don't want to opt for the rather pricy hotel breakfasts in their restaurant. If it weren't for the AC problem - I'd give the place at least 4 stars. I'd stay here again.;3;2;2;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
980;8/11/2010;oJbiaNiQ89TOCkd-i7Gxng;K1bfh7PICyHorS_Ek41y9g;Maybe Im just not a W person. I arrived at about 11pm since my flight was delayed, and when I entered the hotel, I thought I must have come through the wrong door, seeing only couches and people sipping trendy martinis. I walked back outside and asked the bellman where the main entrance was, and he informed me that the "lounge" in front of me was actually the main lobby, and that the front desk is back in the corner (FACT: if a front desk is back in a corner....its not a front desk!) Anyways, we navigated out way (with our suitcases) through a maze of couches and cosmo-sippers to the "corner desk" and finally made it to our room. I guess I'm just an old fart, but I thought it was a little too trendy. Like, why do I need lights eminating from under the bed? And why do I need inspirational phrases on the pillows & walls? Just give me a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. Bathroom was TINY, and the toilet was wedged between the sink and the wall with very little room to sit comfortably while you do your business. Also, can someone please tell me WHY hotel TVs are so weird? Why cant you just change the channel without having to press the button 5 times? and why does it go back to the stupid hotel channel that nobody watches every time you turn it off & on again? So frustrating! Minus 1 star! I will say that the service we experienced was good, all the staff we encountered from the desk clerks, to the bellmen, etc were very nice and accomodating. Unfortunately, that wasnt enough to save the hotel. I loved Chicago and will return, but not to this hotel.;2;2;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
981;8/11/2006;YXzbCciUhzF8eSOqqXj-9Q;hJIkUEh3gEB3ICQwzRe1UQ;this review is for happy hour only. I enjoyed the vibe (too cool for school) and the drinks, though expensive (standard downtown $12+ for martinis) were good.  An A for decor and atmosphere.  bar area is small but very hip.;3;2;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
982;8/14/2007;Do2;Glx5E9V2q2McIjVSDmYL_Q;So I stay here on business and must say for an upscale hotel charging over $300 a night it is pretty crappy. It is very loud at  timess (Some rooms near the L must drive people crazy).  I have had several rooms where the drains work very poorly.  Some thing never work in the hotel (Interent being one of them);1;1;1;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
983;5/30/2008;0S;kZLlJLkl-8LhuovdnNeRdA;I stayed here for a business trip and had an average-good experience.  At least it was not the boring cookie cutter hotel I usually have to stay in for these sorts of trips.  I got in pretty early, around 10 am and I was able to check in which was great.  I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the bell hops out front who opened the front doors for me about 30 times in one day when I decided to try to see Chicago in 8 hours in between fielding work requests were great. The room itself was fine and as to be expected from a hotel like this.  Not overly wonderful but certainly comfortable.  The bathroom was pretty small and there were too many doors that you had to open and close.  If you're staying here for a while you might want to make sure you have one of the bigger bathrooms.  There seems to be a lighting problem in this hotel - there were not enough lamps in my room nor did they emit enough light.   I too had the $28 oatmeal and coffee!  Seems to be the breakfast of Yelp champions.  I do agree it was way overpriced, even by room service standards.   I feel bad for the people that work at the front desk here, they have to do everything by candlelight.  They should at least let them have bigger candles.;3;1;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
984;8/3/2009;2DkQT2nWSzzWuQ4go27ReQ;FSl6qeRIu7kPQfZpBl1Npg;The lobby is beautiful. Have you been in there at night (like 3am), when it's almost empty, dark, and the disco balls are lit, so it looks like stars in the sky? It's amazing.   So romantic, and beautiful. The room was so nice, wonderful bed, huge TV, pillows to sink into. I loved it. Free wifi in the lounge, cozy seating areas that make it feel private, free workout gym. I love the gym. Every time we went, there were alway other people there. The machines had TV's and they had headphones for you to use. There was also face wipes, towels, water, and apples. I also love how it is part of NWA/delta's vacation packages and you can use your miles to pay for part of the hotel room. What a great deal!;5;1;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
985;4/1/2007;jmfmSM0zFpUWVA5vsFuhdA;SBfVvcr0WD3BDymjDWhl4w;Stayed at the W City Centre over the marathon weekend, and had mixed feelings. The location was perfect for the marathon as it was close to the start and finish, and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when I went to "wicked". Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district. On weekends, it's a ghost town around there, not many things like restaurants, cafes or shops are open. I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile, that is where al the "hubub" is. Rookie Mistake! As for the actual hotel, the room was tiny (not surprised). If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room. The washroom amenties were top notch, and of course the Bed was Heavenly. The rooms were very chic, but the walls are paper thin, nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom. The concierge staff at the hotel was below average. I always felt like they had no clue. Either that, or they couldn't be bothered to make an effort. The front desk staff were excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. If not for them, I would have downgraded the hotel. The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting. The food was brutal and the service was even worse. I don't ask for much, but when I say Thank-you please acknowledge me. When I ask for some water, please acknowledge me. When I am ordering from the menu please look at me. The lobby is one of the coolest places. The design and ambience is very funky. It's kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering martini's a few steps away. Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out, as well. Overall, I don't think I'd come back. Unless, you need to be close to the financial district.....stay at or near the Mag Mile, and maybe pop in for a cocktail at Whiskey Blue one night.;3;1;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
986;8/2/2010;Iw8QOuCkZwlCp2CYWq0vDA;KdOifP5NyKBapw0hnV8a0g;Stayed here for a weekend using my points and was upgraded to a Fantastic suite, which was pretty spacious. The room and bathroom were clean and had plenty of space and I have only two complaints about the room: 1) The bathroom sink was really small. Everytime I tried to wash my face or something, I would end up splashing water all over myself and the sink. 2) The toilet was situated in THE most awkward space. It was tucked away in the corner of the bathroom and there was literally only 2 inches of space between the front of the toilet and the wall. So bizarre, considering that the room itself had this big open welcome area that was directly adjacent to the bathroom. Other than those relatively minor complaints, I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel decor is really trendy and modern...and also very dim. It's not the type of hotel I would typically stay at, but it was definitely fun to spend a weekend here. The staff is helpful and pretty friendly for the most part. A good thing to note is that this location isn't particularly close to anything besides the Willis Tower and Millennium Park, meaning if you're in town and want to go out at night, the W Hotel - Lakeshore is a lot closer to a livelier nightlife. There are also not very many restaurants or other things to do around this location, but it is very close to two CTA stops.;4;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
987;9/13/2010;oA7D-I0wEdQbperjgxc2PA;OPYJBgEcl5mD5abVkYsHMQ;I am a stick in the mud. Stick in the muds and the W hotel just don't match. It was a nice room, but I hate everything being a la carte. The sink showcased the bold look of Kohler, but was so tiny I could barely wash my face without splashing water on my feet. The elevators had this bizarre 3D sticker thing going on with a black light shining to make things super trippy.  I imagine it must be freaky when you're drunk. Speaking of drunks, this seems to be the place for a lot of clubbers to go out and then come back and spend the night.  We were woken up by a group of drunk guys at 3AM who decided the hallway outside our door was the perfect place to hold a conversation.   An extra star goes to security coming up right away when I called to complain.  At least they don't expect other guests to reason with drunk people.;2;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
988;10/31/2007;eOi;M5LtDy5By13s0W00e5n8WA;Quick review of the hotel itself - I first stayed here about 3 years ago.  I dig W's because A) I travel alot and W's have a solid theme.  You can walk into the W Dallas or the W Seattle or the W Lakeshore and you immediately more or less know your way around the hotel.  All of a sudden things become more manageable.  B) W's usually have nice gyms.  C)  W's usually have terrific locations. 3 years ago this one almost turned me off of W's forever.  There but for the saving grace of the Lakeshore W - a truly wonderful, friendly home away from home ... However, I was recently in Chicago when the whole darn city seemed to be sold out.  My only option was the City Center W.  I prepared myself for a sour experience.  To my surprise, they have brought things up a bit.  Looks like they have replaced the carpets, fixed up the bathrooms, and upgraded the A/C units (less rattlerattlerattle AIEEE!).  The staff were friendly and smiling at checkin/out.  Things were much better. Better than the Lakeshore?  Oh my no.  That's still my first choice.  But better than 3 years ago?  Yes.  Give them another 3 years and let's see what happens.;3;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
989;12/5/2009;3geehUQ5pgCXbzYQvlF;UEJKy14WnWy7cwcVPSGynQ;This review is for the lobby/bar Very cool atmosphere and great drinks. I thought the staff was friendly and provided good service. There was a nice happy hour crowd there on Friday but after 7:30/8:00 most had cleared out. Bonus: You can bring your dog! Talked to the concierge after seeing a beautiful husky come in for happy hour. Apparently the W is a very pet friendly hotel.;4;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
990;12/17/2009;61Z7IdiiHklpFdRoGS1k8A;E9xYJMx9qEpr5JKzFFjh8Q;EVERYTHING was fine BESIDES the room size. I stayed in a horriblely small room. I guess it was a standard room, but if I'd known it was very cramped I would of paid for a bit more. The next day I checked out and stayed at the W - Lakeshore and have been extremely happy ever since. The location at W - City Center is a bit better for transportational purposes than Lakeshore, but that's really it.;3;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
991;3/10/2009;JoQsN7Sg--mxU5vRMeBFjg;vBAejKR6g7vZSfLh5kG_iA;I love "W" Hotels.  They always have friendly staff and cool, loungey atmosphere in the lobby.  Two very small examples of why my stay at the "W" City Center was memorable.  It was my Birthday weekend and"W"-Insider Jessica Young took the time to send me a little birthday platter of goodies! AND this "W" had a particularly AWESOME fruity smell coming from around the elevators.  Two little examples of how the hotel serves and comforts its guest.   I chose, will recommend and will stay at the W City Center again instead the more socially centric W Lakeshore for a number of reasons.  Since it caters to business travellers it tends to have much better weekend rates.  It is also very close to the Sears Tower, Greek Town (I'm Greek so it was important I go see how my people are doing) Millennium Park (The Silver Bean) and Grant Park (The Fountain from Married: with Children).  Plus there is a Loop stop at the corner AND a water taxi stop down a block that will take you to the Navy Pier.  Can't go wrong at the W!;4;0;1;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
992;5/28/2008;XrvuT6hbAQiT18v1eUnuOg;68hwnz-mvN3fKYWkyfIhXA;I arrived here at about 11 PM on a Sunday night exhausted, grouchy, and a little irritated after a 4 hour flight from San Francisco.  I had a 7 AM meeting and work to finish before I went to bed. The lobby itself was beautiful, low lighting, candles, modern furniture but a little small but still very chic.  A lot cooler than the one in my hometown of SF.  Sorry.  :-(   My room was nice, big king sized bed, flat screen TV, desk, the usual amenities for a nice hotel.   Things I didn't like: - $20 plus breakfast of oatmeal and coffee.  WTF?  Is it organic oatmeal?  Is the coffee hand delivered by Juan Valdez?  I know there is a premium for room service but it's just oatmeal.   - Ugly views, really, my window faced another brick building and was located near the train.   - Pretentious front desk staff.  Do I sense a little snobbiness?  I can tell when you're being rude, and acting catty, I maybe sleepy, tired, but I'm not STUPID!  I would appreciate it if in the future you didn't give me certain looks. You know which one, "I wish you'd hurry up..."  or "This smile is fake, but I'm doing it because my manager is watching me."   A ho hum experience, nothing spectacular.;3;0;0;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
993;12/22/2008;oM46h2Bgry-PbWh1hF7VoA;-Enu_Cc8lJ-yVcRvatf0hw;We stayed at the W the weekend just before Christmas. I went with a bit of trepidation, given that I am not a particular fan of the W on Lex in NYC. A major discount on the regular rate was the motivation to give it a try. When you walk in the front door, you could swear you are walking into a mini versus of the NYC Lex W with Whiskey Blue on the left and a popular after hours lounge the right. However, after spending a few more minutes soaking in the atmosphere you'll notice the vaulted ceiling, tile, and marble accents that give it a warmer, more dignified feel. The elevators will almost knock you over with their 3-d holographic-like walls. Expecting the usual W-esque room, we were amazed to find out they upgraded us to a large junior suite. It looked like the head designer from Pottery Barn just redid the place. Very impressive. What was not impressive is that they want $15 to connect to the net for the day (and no Boingo), though the lobby wireless was free. The staff was especially pleasant. Though it was -30 windchill, the door man stood outside for almost 15 minutes trying to find us a cab. He then convinced the Acura driver to drive us to Midway for no charge. They have a joint promotion with Acura to drive you anywhere within 5 miles for free to show off their cars. We wish we knew this earlier. The only problem is the location if you are going for a weekend. It is only one block from the Quincy L stop, which is nice if you are coming from Midway. But you have to transfer (or jaunt up to Clark and Lake) if you plan to use the trains for anywhere else. It is not a bad walk to State Street to Marshall Fields (ugh...."Macys"....) but a bear to get up to Mag Mile if it is zero like it was the weekend we went. Cabs are the order of the day, but not easy to find in the financial district on the weekend. Very few decent restaurants in the area. Overall, we were happy with our stay, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.;4;0;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
994;10/13/2011;VswumdmKPS1mXmrsSocp8g;heys0iwRjs5ZC7rTNn-iTQ;I came here for a wedding show and while I was waiting in the lobby for my boyfriend to pick me up I noticed that they don't have any plugs for people to use their laptops or to charge up their cell phones in their lounge area. I also have a problem with the fact that their bathrooms were nasty and smelled like a million unwashed &^%$#es and could be better maintained in terms of cleanliness. I am a huge stickler when it comes to nasty stinky bathrooms. It's a nice hotel just needs to be on top of keeping their bathrooms cleaner. I've gone to hotels where the bathrooms are so clean you can walk around barefoot in them. If they just have an area for those who want to charge their cell phones and use their laptops in the lounge area put some plugs in. Overall it's a nice hotel to attend a show or just staying there if you're on vacation or coming for buisness.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

996;1/12/2011;dk7ZrPhsaWmJWmMOnoxDjg;ygVe6dNs9PwOJCxnEVYHCg;I recently spent two nights at the City Center W and had a fine, but not overwhelmingly positive, experience. As other reviewers have mentioned, W hotels try to cultivate a "club like" feel. The purple lights and throbbing techno music don't do a whole lot for me, so I'm thankful that they're restricted to the first floor and the elevators. The room my partner and I stayed in was small but adequately furnished with sleek, modern furniture in neutral colors. There was a king sized bed, desk, chair, a few cabinets, and plenty of conveniently placed outlets for cellphone chargers, laptops, etc. Because we were placed in a corner room, the placement of our television was a bit awkward (it's my understanding that most of the rooms have the television positioned on a wall facing the bed, but our bed faced an exterior wall with windows and the television was mounted off to the side -- had we actually been using the television, this might have posed an issue.) The bathroom was adequately stocked with plush towels and Bliss brand toiletries. My only complaint is that the sink was borderline miniature. It seemed like no matter how careful I was when I brushed my teeth or washed my hands, I always ended up having to grab a hand towel and mop some water up off the floor. The hotel is located near stops for both the red and blue L lines, which was perfect for my partner and I. We utilized the L in favor of cabs throughout our stay and were able to get to the majority of our destinations via the red line (which conveniently runs all night.) The staff was friendly and efficient, willing to offer directions and dining recommendations. I used the "Whatever/Whenever" service once to request foam pillows instead of down (allergies!) and considering that I called well after midnight, they arrived promptly. My one real complaint (aside from the tiny bathroom sink) is that the in-room wireless is not complimentary. There is complimentary wireless in the lobby area, but the club decor/music in the lobby doesn't exactly facilitate a good working environment. So, if you need to keep up on your work e-mail and are without a smart phone, you'll likely have to shell out for in-room wireless.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
997;11/18/2007;hME9G3zoYSScM-lXdkeK3w;VlUnhotMqY6msql_GMyvhg;The comfiest beds that I can recall.  We were so in love with the bed that we were looking at their in-room catalog for the purchase price.  On an extended July 4th holiday, we would find ourselves in bed until two because we'd just loose track of time.  However, since the W is so centrally located, we found ourself doing all of the following, four days: 1 Wrigley game, 1 US Cellular game, several trips to the Taste, a numerous other touristy stuff, and 1 Nine Inch Nails concert at Tweeter. The rooms had a very modern appeal and the towels were very lush.  The square footage was small, but they made good use of their space to seem bigger. Quick room service.  Love the apples and little nooks in the lobby.  Two bars, one in the lobby and a larger one with a street entrance. Parking on the street is not difficult, especially at night.  But, you could also have them valet it for $39 per evening.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
998;12/6/2009;FVMUW7IyskKFZgG;czq3zEPXC2ipRLXA8xIjvw;Rooms here are actually much nicer than the lakeshore location. Rooms seemed larger, BUT you have no views...but you are in the heart of the financial district. So it all depends on what you want. I like the rooms better. I will say SERVICE WAS SLOW EVERYWHERE. RESTARAUNT WAS HORRID SLOW, TOOK 40 MINUTES TO GET SCRAMBLED EGGS AND ANOTHER 10 MINUTES FOR KETCHUP. I think this can be a swank place, good location for theatre etc..but the service here is way below par and please expect to wait for everything here.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
999;5/3/2010;gHB4QqNKZzyECx;EGYsPKoNGf8kqAO-Ma-8TQ;Trendy, well-located hotel with great hospitality. The rooms are spacious but forget the view. Typical hotel bar makes a great meeting spot.

Guess they weren't in Suite 1209 -1210 After a hell day of travel, miss connection due to Delta errors, cold front and rain... I was soooo elated to check in!! The lobby was extremely inviting with tall white tufted serpentine couches, chess tables, coffee table books, and bar.  We just didn't have time for it.  Our main purpose was to see as many shows at Lollapalooza as possible.   Whatcha get: King size bed Two bathrooms, two plasma screens, comfy couch, streamline sound system that we turned up late night with out a peep from our neighboring guest's complaint. Bliss products Lots of closets Over-sized lamps and a view that was on the sad side (but who cares we were out enjoying the streets of Chi Town) Concierge was  friendly and didn't mind answering questions like: where to buy an cheap umbrella (which we brought at Walgreens -Totes brand did the job fine), how to get to the metro, is it worth taking the architectural tour etc   Maid service fine. All-in-all great clean, peaceful stay and won't hesitate to visit again.;5;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1001;3/16/2010;PubYRvpvK;2wki96F1Aifs3mjlEscJ1Q;I absolutely love this hotel. The location is perfect and the ambiance is very sexy. My room was 600 sq feet of luxury.

1002;4/20/2009;RdekwsDo-PXz2bES4CyLHQ;IxIMBRzydL3qdfXLcWSAYg;This review is strictly about "The Living Room Bar" in the lobby. Loved it. Maybe it's because we were there early on a Saturday or because it wasn't a busy weekend, but we had the place practically to ourselves. We strolled in just for drinks on a whim while walking home. It's romantic, quiet and has cool decor.   Our server was prompt and attentive at the right times and the drink list is great.  Sure, it's probably $12 or so for the average drink, but it's a lounge-type place where you go to start of the night or to end it. I'd definitely go back if I was wandering by again.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1003;7/9/2009;2IHT7;iSWsgppkv4dNyhDMGTpOJw;Love it. Loved the lounge area, and that night they had happy hour or cheap drinks, can't remember but it was nice. The rooms and bathrooms were very nice too, a bit small, but decorated very nicely. Bad view from my room, but I didn't mind since I wasn't staying there very long. Location was perfect, so close to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Union Station, and great restaurants. Every time I visit Chicago I want to stay here, but can't always find a good deal. This is definitely one of my favorite hotels to stay at.;5;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

It is beautiful lobby and great layout. the staff is amazing, probably one of the most professional in the city. Great group of people. The rooms are nice too. Great place for a wedding or reception. Starwood (who own the hotels) have specials from time to time so check their website. otherwise just check out drinks in their lobby (called the Living Room);4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1005;6/22/2010;C-96pQo0VF439OLi5m--fw;bz1AG4rGpVsFT1IbMyYKxw;The W has an ultra-modern, swanky vibe and is not the kind of hotel I would typically stay in, but it is right around the corner from the site of our wedding (the Rookery building), so we recommended it to all of our out-of-town guests and stayed there ourselves the weekend of the wedding. Overall our experience there was a positive one.  The people I dealt with to reserve our room block were nice, and the suite we stayed in was large and clean.  They also get a bonus star for the tray of chocolate-covered strawberries that we found in our room.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1006;8/2/2009;tErdDAd78basLCu7XrLsag;UHfUBqtIgwto0Ykt-5ApXg;This W staff here is 100x more approachable and friendlier than the W on Lakeshore.  The lounge/lobby is beautiful and inviting.  Concierge very helpful and accessible.  Even though the rooms were small, the bed and shower were very comfortable and made our hotel stay very enjoyable.  The fitness center is very well maintained, they provide water, towels, cold wet towels, apples, headphones, aerobic  machines with tvs on them, free weights, mats to stretch.  I would highly recommend checking it out.  The individual rooms did not have their own coffee pots, but they provide complimentary coffee til 10am every morning in the lobby. Yes the walls are very thin but I've noticed this in most hotels (i.e. The James, and the W on Lakeshore).  I would recommend rooms far from the elevators.  I would have preferred to stay at a more prime location, but its very close to the mag mile and millenium park.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1007;2/23/2010;yK-70CRpokUMrhy1zuZNEQ;LAs17kKoqgHpfH96w_gMKw;I thought I was going to the W on Lakeshore, I was wrong but was pleasantly surprised.  Spent my birthday nite there with some girlfriends.  All I can say is top-notch customer service.  Walked in and was given the mini-tour of the living room and bar area, nice.  The hotel was very sleek.  I told the front desk it was my birthday and they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and the best chocolate torte I have ever had. Yummmmm I chose the special rate which includes parking (normally $51 per night) and two free drinks at the bar.  It was well worth it.   They also have a complimentary Acura car service which I took full advantage of.   What better way to spend my birthday day than free champagne and pulling up to the restaurant to meet my friends looking and feeling like a million bucks! Thanks W !;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1008;2/24/2010;bMWTui3znvlyEtPQrMFJjQ;6MMEmO_ig3dXfdHzzGYv0A;I stayed here for a week while on business. The location is great and the hotel is very clean and accomodating while you are there. There was one incident while I was there, where I came back to my room and saw that the pringles from the mini bar selection had been eaten and the cap put back on. I called down to report the problem and was told that a note would be put on my account. After I checked out and returned home, I reviewed my receipt that was sent via email. 2 cans of $6 pringles were on there that I never ate. I've attempted to call the hotel 3 times, only to be directed to a voicemail that either no one checks or to someone who is too lazy to return calls. I would still stay here again, but I would review my receipt while I'm still in the hotel.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1009;7/2/2011;-M-ugOJ65d83IJiKPMsxTg;HlWnjPtn7mE4ApKdXGh8zQ;I spent three months traveling on business and staying at this hotel.  They treated me like family and the service was absolutely amazing.  It was right aruound the corner from my office but had several different options of hotels to stay at.  This was as good as it gets! Throughout my stay, I intereacted was two concierge attendents who on a regular basis did everything to make my stay comfortable - Vanessa L and Laurelin did everything from finding me restaurants, delivery, to even interviewing personal trainers to train me in the hotel gym.  That was only the begininning, they called and followed up with me on a regular basis on how they could help make my extended stay comfortable.  Even a bottle of wine sent to my room, when I had a bad day.  They offered me runs to the store when I was sick or had any other needs.  It doens't get better than this. Jeff, Tree and Israel were amazing with taking care of my luggage and other needs.  I regularly left my luggage at the hotel when I would leave town on the weekends.  To come back and have it back in my room, thanks to this team.   Deborah, was very helpful and kept my room clean on a regular basis.  Justin, the hotel manager, set me up wit a suite for a weekend stay when friends were visiting, including a parlor room. This was an amazing experience and while I may be going back for business travel for work, this is the only hotel I will stay at in Chicago.  Not to mention, it's super swanky and everything seems brand spanking new...;5;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1010;7/12/2009;iw8NwGgaFj4vA3m3VipuEQ;PqQTOkV4zYnCcZhNW1-CyQ;In general, this hotel was a disappointment.  I was expecting much more from a W. The front desk is in an odd location - it requires directions to find.  The decor in the hotel is modern. I checked in around midnight and had booked a room that was supposed to a "Wonderful Room" with 253 sq ft.  Instead, they sent me to a room about half that size.  The bathroom was so small that there was no room for the waste basket - which they positioned practically  in front of the toilet.  The vanity was so small that there was definitely no place to put the regular toiletries people bring when they travel.  I assume they think you will be running these back and forth between your luggage and the bathroom. The person checking me in informed me that this was a newly renovated room and it did smell that way.  However, they missed small details such as the air conditioner against the wall was not caulked and the old wall was showing behind it. When I called to let them know I was not satisfied with this accommodation, they offered to upgrade me for another $70/night.  Eventually, I went down to the front desk and the next person on duty was excellent.  He was anxious to make things right and immediately moved me to another room that was twice the size - probably the room I reserved at 253 sq ft. (no additional charge) The lounge was nice.  The service was good and the waitresses were friendly and helpful.  The security personnel were also nice as were the people at the bell desk. The exercise room was reasonable (called the Sweat Room) - but the thermostat was set too high and it was pretty warm in there.  I guess that's why they call it the sweat room:-)   There was a relatively small collection of equipment but it was in good condition and well maintained. Other than the bad first impression, this hotel is okay.  It is nothing exceptional though and for the price, there are better places.;2;2;1;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1011;2/7/2006;kN0XpxDuNiC;kHqwAX3PvXe-W71MUZsUHQ;I love these hotels, comfy soft bouncy beds... lol. Very Clean Very Spacious Rooms, Huge Bathrooms... Great service. Every each one is very elegant and they go from old fashioned to modern interiors. Price is always resonable and it's always in a nice location, always close to best entertainment spots in the city. All my friends stay at "The W"  when  they come to Chicago. I highly recommend it.;5;2;1;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1012;6/8/2006;5yC4whUcBKYxUx6My4-YfQ;Zy_Ge-kUmw6W_25Rbabivg;I  went to a conference here the other day with around 400+ people.

1013;9/29/2009;8sqVmimDKU4Z04SdpuGbfw;ehM0gryVpI5vAqUidIXrzw;Very trendy, cool looking hotel.

1014;8/4/2005;AvoEwPs5kLE-eFcKIDVCeQ;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;The W has converted the former Midland Hotel into a swanky and cool place to be.

The rooms and interiors are colorfully and boldly designed, and the new touches combine well with the old.;4;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1015;4/20/2008;3;cpUM9bOVufwQzpJcmBumuw;This not the best W hotel I've stayed at, but it's not bad. I stay here for business trips and it's convenient. I've been warned that the rooms are very small so I've always requested free upgrades as a Gold Member and gotten them. The beds are super comfortable, and I horde the Bliss products because I love them so. The gym also has free Voss water, which is great!;4;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1016;7/28/2008;Q6VOYqt7LIWFppwrQ605sQ;rQrqrb5dFztAeFYwyqbygA;Get an upgrade to a suite. It's worth it. I've had two friends stay in the suites at this property... and they are pretty cool. Again, I am not a fan of the W Chain, but I like this one.;4;0;2;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1017;7/10/2010;fQALY5i-BPKwZN6uHGigEQ;ApvAgysU3OLZDV59rBaolQ;Pretentious, much?  Stayed here with a discounted rate:I would have never paid full price for this snobbery. The W has a reputation for luxury, but I wouldn't consider this hotel luxurious. One of my friends said it best when he commented that staying at this hotel seems to come with the prerequisites of an eating disorder and a cocaine problem. The hotel just tries too darn hard. The lobby is dimly lit and full of mirrors like a 70s nightclub. The rooms are large, very clean, and somewhat well appointed, but definitely not worth the cash. The elevators literally made me want to puke with blacklights and holograms--seriously?! And for all of the ridiculous "Welcome to the W, what's your wish" nonsense, the people at the front desk were quite preoccupied by their personal cell phones. Parking's $51. Save yourself some cash and park at that Self Park down the street over night for $34.;2;1;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1018;1/5/2009;LupTfpWRnnqR2QExe0QGgw;2dwGSzILaZK8rysR-oFoXw;This is a great hotel! You get upscale without the snobby. The rooms are spacious and the decor in the rooms are classy.

If you're very sensitive to sound, make sure you request a quiet room or don't be surprised by the frequent rumbling sounds of the Metra. The bed was much softer than I'd thought a Starwood hotel would be. Normal horde of Bliss products. The bathroom was huge.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1021;1/23/2007;wEC5Y;xywCpj3Z6D0Gz_wd2IgfZQ;Stayed here between Christmas and New Year's.  Starwood Gold membership gave me a free upgrade, and the much larger room on an upper floor was great - absolutely no complaints. Unfortunately, I had a REALLY ANNOYING experience with the keycards they give you for access to your room.  At first, it worked only after about 10-15 attempts.  Finally, shortly before checking out, it stopped altogether, and of course, I was experiencing nature's call at the time.  Called down to the front desk and waited nearly 20 MINUTES for someone to come up let me into my room.  They're REALLY LUCKY I had not wet my pants. But the Bliss Spa welcome kit was really great (enormous bar of soap that is still enormous after using every day for a month) and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Also, they allowed me early (11 am) check-in and late (4:00 pm) checkout, which was really cool and not always possible at other hotels.  Would definitely stay here again.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1022;10/25/2010;FYH49lEDlY;zMgwLH29hbo-p1n2e-THNA;Supposedly special weekend that I had written to the hotel about before arriving.  This hotel failed in so many ways I hope that others will think before booking here.  Service - non-existent.  4 of us at the lounge for over 2 hours - nobody ever came to see if we needed anything until we were getting ready to leave.  Concierge?  Non-existent at the hotel - had to go 4 times before somebody was there for us to ask for a breakfast recommendation (instead - I Yelped and was EXTREMELY pleased).  One person at the desk so wait time to check in was long and tedious.  All in all - I would not go back here especially since there are nicer and better hotels in the Chicago area.  This hotel seems very worn down and in need of an update too.  Finally, I don't need to have self-help sayings plastered all over the place!;1;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1023;6/7/2010;t93XnN9IMbHXFoAXkqv2wg;9SJD7ZnLdzTE_ogf2ySLLQ;FuFu is not always hip. Employees: The employees try to be so cool, they seem distant. Not much personality here.   Cleanliness: The hotel is clean, but looks too dark inside. Facility: The room we stayed in was just plain strange. It was long and narrow. The hot water for the tiny sink in the Bathroom, along with the shower was not consistent. The sink water never got warm enough and the shower water took forever to get warm. You can't watch the flat panel TV from any place in the room. You can't see it from the bed, even though they have it mounted on a swivel base up on the wall, it doesn't swivel enough. Not even close. There is no couch. You only get a fufu chair that is one of those long chairs and it's REALLY uncomfortable. As you walk into the room, there is only one tiny light in the ceiling. This makes the entire front part of the room too dark to be useful. The one saving grace for the room was the bed. It was great, along with the bath towels. The desk in the room (908) has broken leg tips. Those silly looking words printed inside the lamp shade and also in the wine shelf were just plain spooky. It made using those lights a no-go. There was a nice ice machine on this floor. The slide light controller for the lamp was lame. The elevators have sort of 3D images on each side of little round objects. It's not good to place 3D in transportation devices that go up and down. This makes some guests dizzy. You have to navigate through a narrow corridor in the Lobby because they have places for people to sit and drink as you attempt to leave the hotel. Overall Recommendation: This hotel is located near, well, nothing. A better choice would be the Intercontinental located on the Magnificent Mile. It has gobs of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.;2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1024;10/23/2010;BBjwZLml-Uv9b-9wJWPJqw;yIG8aHbb3aFdDo7AXUt2Ew;I'm surprised this place has gotten some poor reviews. My group and I came for a convention and checked in with relative ease. The staff was courteous. Granted, the check in was in a corner but I felt like this hotel in its entirety had a unique modern feel to it. (There was complimentary drinks at the checkin although non-alcoholic) The rooms themselves were not all set up the same although had same features. The bathroom was modern, not spectacular, but definitely nice. I LOVED the large flatscreen that was in every room. Just imagine modern beds, desks, bathrooms, ect. Hell you can even buy half the stuff in their catalog. On my visit there was a plate of cheese and stuff. (it had a card with a different name on it but hey, we were hungry) The concierge is amazing. Needed some mouthwash. They stated they didn't have any. Guy came up. Gave him a dollar. Went to shower. Came out and saw a bottle of mouthwash sitting there with the $4.95 sticker still on it. This guy went to buy mouthwash that cost more than what I gave him! We got there late, wanted to buy some beer but was told the liquor store was closed. They sent up 2 complimentary coronas. Service was amazing. Room service was good. ( i was kinda buzzed tho so that may have thrown my palate off a bit) Concierge was top notch. Had a bill dispute hence the 4 stars. (bottle of wine was charged to our room although there wasn't a bottle there when we had arrived.) I would definitely stay again. Even just to ride in their elevators with the 3d thing that trips you out.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

1026;3/7/2010;dCBTHsT6jLVxLuPkQ3CDWA;CDxqHFcAix6-jZGNsTOJsw;W = Will not be staying here again. The room was TINY - the bed was super hard (Fred Flinstone's bed people), there was track lighting on the floor - which was difficult to turn off.  And the best part?  Our heat was broken - and our room was 90 degrees by the time we woke up in the morning.  I couldn't wait to leave. We got our room comped because of an event my boyfriend was attending - so thank god, we didn't pay for this.     This is my first experience with the W chain and I must say that I am not eager to try this chain out again.  Too bad that the City Center spoiled this supposedly fabulous hotel line for us.   There are plenty of hotels in Chicago - and you can do a lot better somewhere else.;2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

The rooms are very nice, with white cabinets/shelves in the room and plenty of space. The big issue I have with this property is the layout of the lobby area.  There's not a lot of space, and the path to the check-in desk and elevators is not very intuitive.

1028;5/21/2008;w9wFWIh;is-OqExMZoHdD1h3KYxoqQ;DON'T HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE!!!!!  I had mine at the W City Center and although it is a beautiful place, I can't imagine how they could have screwed up more.  This is even considering I had my own private wedding planner.  I don't want to know what would have happened if they did the event on their own.  I'll make this short  and only include a couple screw ups.... 1. They screwed up my PARENTS' room....yes my parents'...the ones actually paying for this 300 person event!  They were supposed to have a suite with a King Sized bed and they had a room with a double.  They kept giving them the wrong keys to the room for about and hour and with all of this hassle made them late to rehearsal dinner. 2.  They threw out the top of our cake!!!!!  Who does that!?  That's a common tradition to save that for your first anniversary.  They apologized and said they would make us a new one for our anniversary.  So, a year later I got in touch with the catering department to coordinate our new cake.  She said "no problem" etc.....then the woman didn't return my phone calls/emails the week before my anniversary and we AGAIN didn't have a cake! This was absolutely NOT what I anticipated from one of the nicest and most expensive hotels in the city that could have held my wedding!;1;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

I felt like I was in a nightclub in the elevator, I guess they really cater to a young crowd.  The concierge however gave us incorrect information about reservations at a restaurant so that was annoying but I'd still come back.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1030;4/5/2010;zpFQElqCku13NL8I2vNPGQ;vicE5WHdFHgQUHIoydnK_Q;This was the cleanest hotel I have ever been in. The service was also fantastic. Every person I encountered was wonderful from the doormen, to the wait staff, to the cleaning personnel. The service and friendliness made my weekend getaway fantastic!;5;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1031;1/14/2007;TXMpTr;ZBTsTxr580wPjB2y4MitoA;Kind of crazy.  This place is super swank in the lobby. Sort of West Elmy with a plum velvet twist. Light projections, art, velvet furniture, black lobby. 2 door guys, 1 concierge, 2 desk people, 1 very tall blonde and removed store clerk. Some very cute, kitschy and extremely specific items in the hotel shoppe. The hotel's restaurants and bars swing right off the lobby behind tall black walls. Initial impression was grande. The stay. The stay was super plush with a cushy king, proper amount of pillows for 2 plus a nice body pillow xtra. Toiletries included Bliss travel pack (found at Sephora for $25 a pop). Very nice. CS/Modern Luxury and Wired magazine in the room, nice details. Overall, the stay was comfy and friendly. We stayed in the Fabulous room. Service. Service was ok. It didn't seem to be very coordinated. I was supposed to have champagne and strawberries delivered for my birthday morning. Didn't happen and we got tired of waiting. They tried to reschedule for the evening and that really wasn't as seamless as you'd think, either. The first night of our stay, we requested extra hangers. We had to ask repeatedly and then we finally got them. Like a DOZEN of them, on our last day. Thanks. The Whiskey Blue was a nice hangout and you can't really beat the location as far as being able to walk to many of the touristy attractions and CTA. The hotel did seem to be a magnet for underage teens which was kind of odd to me. For some reason, I don't really notice teens in VA unless it's in Tysons Corner, where they persist in droves. In Chicago, it seems like it is teen CENTRAL!;2;1;1;1;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

1033;12/14/2009;VO5kKCYxn1uiF-bw63RRcg;Xxvz5g67eaCr3emnkY5M6w;Stayed here on the, "Come and Play" promo rate of $139 per night which included 2 nights of parking and 2 free cocktails.  Great deal.  I have stayed at SO many W hotels...I used to prefer this one over Lake Shore but I'm starting to re-think that.  The rooms at Lake Shore are bigger.  We stayed in room #1715 which was a Wonderful room with a king-size bed.  I was shocked at how thin the walls were--I heard the baby crying in the room next to me.  UGH.  I've never had this problem during prior stays.  Front desk staff is very accommodating.  Kudos to the maid for replenishing our Bliss toiletries every day with new ones (even if we still had full ones).  I found the bartender in the Living Room bar to be completely bitchy.  I ordered a glass of wine and Shirley Temple for my niece and it was as if I had asked her to drive to Evanston to get the ice to put in the Shirley Temple.  Rarely do I forego tips but she didn't get a tip from me because of her attitude.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1034;5/25/2010;SzVf5uBTDM-0I;nutSaTJfODYOzfgiouMuHA;A friend of mine and her family stayed here while they were attending a wedding a couple blocks away. They asked me to meet them to watch their little boy. They were promised a pool. I found it odd that this particular one had a pool but it was promised. There is no pool.  OK, small oversight.  As I got settled in, I ordered room service for myself and their child. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, I asked for a chicken sandwich (seriously, this was the cheapest thing on the menu and it was $14) and a peanut butter sandwich for the little guy. I specified 3 times to not put jelly on this sandwich.   I also ordered a glass of milk and a diet pepsi. The bill total was $44.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  I know that hotels way overcharge for room service but you can get some decent food...this was crap.  The sandwich was way over seasoned and mushy and the fries were stuck together and, again, way over seasoned.  The peanut butter sandwich came WITH JELLY on hard bread.  It did not get eaten. Now on to the pros... great rooms, great lobby, hip and very cool interior, comfy pillows, Bliss products, huge bathroom and cool decor in the rooms.  Oh and HUGE tv. Overall, if you're in town on business, this place is super convenient... if you're in town on pleasure, stay at the W on Lake Shore Drive. It's larger and much better.  Oh, and no matter what, leave the hotel and check out some of Chicago's excellent restaurants. Don't eat here under ANY circumstances.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
1035;10/12/2007;xi549a6w9qC6i0JwwQTpjA;8tvGdO6hkYh4U_1v4Hyycg;As everyone knows, the W is known for it's contemporary, chic decor and of course, the Bliss Spa.  W City Center needs a little help, though.  It's decor lives up to W's reputation, but the rooms are very small and the bathrooms feel more like the Holiday Inn.  The Bliss producst are fabulous, but  I was very disappointed in the hotel overall.  It needs a lot of updating, architectually.  The hallways are narrow, the walls are thin, and the rooms are small and stuffy.  I had trouble sleeping as the airconditioner never really cooled the room off (despite the thermostate being turned down to 66).  The restuarant is fabulous and they did let me check in 4 hours early, so I will give them that.  Overall, the W hotels in Chicago (including the Lakeshore) are disappointing.;3;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

There is so much to do at this hotel. Pizza in lobby restaurant is so tasty. Front desk manger Gerald was so helpful. Barnard helped us with all our needs in the lounge on the 17 floor. Make sure you get a room that you have the privilege to use the longe it has a great breakfast and a great cocktail reception. Oh I forgot to mention Sarah in marketing who help me with all my reservations. Thanks again Radison... I will be back Forsure Mercedes;5;2;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
1037;9/22/2012;-6AMS1WVuW;gA7kbmCtGq0Mb5GX0viZ-Q;The hotel is beautiful with many subtle Chicago touches. I stood in a wedding here last weekend and it was just ok. While checking in at the front desk I was not sure what name the room was booked under but the gentleman apparently doubted if I was even at the right hotel. I believe he was joking but his insinuation was not appreciated. We stayed three nights and the first day our room was not cleaned. I called the front desk with two questions and no one picked up. The message I left was never returned. The suite we got ready for the wedding in did not have a dvd player or anything for us to hook a computer up to the tv with. When I did encounter staff they were nice but overall the experience was underwhelming. The wedding party had a wonderful weekend but the bottom line is for the market the hotel is trying to market itself in (close to $400 a night rooms, $15 dollar drinks) the service and small touches were simply not on par with the rates. We easily could have had an equally good time somewhere else.;2;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
1038;8/27/2012;KNFTz4oCRQ;TzxBfr17eyjTk1XDWyQuog;What an amazingly beautiful hotel. We went here for Lollapalooza and I have to say I was surprised at how quiet it still was with all us crazy people there. The location is perfect! It only took us less than 10 minutes to get to Grant Park walking. You've got Michigan Ave less than 5 minutes away. O'Hare is about a $40 cab ride away. Not too bad. There are 2 pools which are both lap pools, but not too many people doing laps. 2 hot tubs that were nice and heated to the right temperature. The rooms are very modern and beautiful. Don't get the side with the fire house. I'm a deep sleeper so I never heard it, but the bf complained a lot about the sirens. I wish the balconies had furniture, but I get why they don't. I love that you could schedule your room clean up through the tv. Amazing! I would definitely return on my next trip to Chicago. Loved how friendly and helpful everyone was. Oh almost forgot one of the elevators broke on one of the days and in a few hours it was already fixed. I was quite surprised. Great hotel!;4;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
1039;9/23/2012;Ql6KHSxXulqHEkyrLGjPmw;ffJKQCiuONB9y9gJaw9aRg;My parents were planning on going to Chicago for my father's 81st birthday and their 43rd wedding anniversary. When I asked where they were planning on staying, they replied 'Red Roof Inn'. Noooooooo! I quickly called Blu Aqua Hotel and booked a 2-night stay (my treat!) for them. Blu Aqua was awesome! They first looked to see if there were any specials they had for seniors. They didn't at the time, so they offered a breakfast and balcony room package deal. Blu Aqua upgraded my parents room to a corner room (much bigger) with wrap around balcony. They had beautiful chocolates waiting in their room (a birthday and anniversary gift from hotel). They also allowed my parents a super late check out. While in Chicago, my Dad got his wallet snatched (not anywhere near the hotel). The Concierge totally helped Dad cancel his cards by looking online for phone numbers, etc. This would have taken a huge amount of time (and a lot of stress) for my non-tech savvy parents to do this on their own. I totally appreciate how Blu Aqu took care of my parents (especially after the wallet snatching - and helped make such an enjoyable trip). My parents are older (Mom - 72, Dad - 81). It's nice to know someone (Blu Aqu) is looking out for them - when I'm thousands of miles away. THANK YOU, Blu Aqu!!!!;5;1;1;1;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

1042;3/13/2012;RFHnL851uP9m9Fo6yC;U6KBNi5oTnOetfiFsKi2RA;One of my favorite hotels in Chicago....and we have stayed at a variety of hotels in downtown!! Staying 1 night at the Aqua made us want to move to the building permanently....if only ....*sigh* Location is great, it's close to/lovely walking distance to River North and the Mag Mile, yet you're separated from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Although our view was directly of another building, we could still see Navy Pier and the Lake. Morning swim in the indoor pool and dip in a jacuzzi is the perfect way to start a Saturday or Sunday morning!!! The lobby is GORGEOUS!! I couldn't get enough of it! Intricate gold chain designs over mirrored walls with brick column type structures and delicate flowers atop low tables...haven't seen anything like it in Chi yet. The room felt very fresh and clean, loved the modern design of the bathroom...felt very European. Great service. Delicious food and drinks at Fellini. Can't wait to come back.... another Groupon perhaps? :);5;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
1043;5/11/2012;khssGihvVwfuOueBDm;4OaO1062fNr5Rj6t7Bnrdg;I just spent several days at the RBA for a conference and have mixed feelings about the space. Aesthetically, it's gorgeous. The beds are ridiculously comfortable, the shower is GIANT (some rooms have up-to-your-neck deep soaking tubs), the public spaces are inviting and comfortable. But, as an event planner, when I'm paying this much money for a room/event space, I expect some pretty high end functioning. We had several mix ups with our staff rooms and guest rooms (the hotel checking people out too soon or cancelling reservations even when we specifically stated the reservation needed to be changed, not cancelled), the shower handle in my bath broke, as did the knob that gave functionality to the handheld shower head. A member shut her glass shower door only to have it shatter (thankfully it's covered by a film that held the glass in place). And the room had a ridiculous espresso machine that didn't work properly. As far as the event space...again, aethetitically, it's great but it's not set up well for functionality. Screens are too small in meeting rooms, sound system is not created to work on an individual room basis so stand speakers that blocked the screen views were set up, and the registration area is a bar that has little functionality for the needs of registering several hundred people. As a plus, the service staff were extremely friendly and on top of things as soon as they needed to be done...which was a big plus, but not quite enough to make up for the other elements. Hopefully they'll work out the kinks before I get back there next year for our 2013 conference.;3;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
1044;12/13/2011;Q5fQl1;3JgniU0gPJj73fLdBTb55w;Love this place. The interior is gorgeoussss. Everything is shiny, textures everywhere, colors and mirrors... very modern yet comfortable. Okay, now on to the ramblings. Excuse the unorganized paragraph(s) below. Our room was amazing! The second you enter, there's the smell of freshly laid out wood floors... which to me, smells great!  We got a corner room facing Millennium Park and the room itself was surrounded with floor-to-ceiling windows. LOVE IT! We got our own balcony which wrapped around the room (unfortunately, this didn't get much use due to the cold weather.) Awesome King Bed with pillows I wanted to steal. The shower has a rain fall shower head and also a wand that sprays water which after using once, I couldn't figure out how to turn on again. There's a huge bathtub to relax in. Cool little corner toilet which you can close off. And all this is WHITE WHITE WHITE - in other words.. CLEAN! Heater kept us warm. Large flat screen TV if that's important to ya. Free Wi-Fi. Free coffee/tea station in the room. Ipod/radio deck. Wine glasses, mugs, cups, AND to-go cups. bottle opener with a cork screw attached to it. Mini-bar/fridge. What else? 1 robe (why one?), ironing board, laptop sized safe.. plenty of conveniently placed plugs/outlets to charge phones and cameras. Literally like a block or so away from beautiful Millennium park. Few blocks from the trains. There's a CVS next door. Fillini downstairs is beautiful. We had two free drinks voucher so stopped by and had fancy cocktails before heading out. There are two floors dedicated to a pool area, game room (which consists of a pool table and cards table), a community room with a fireplace, food area with microwaves, gym with brand new equipment (lots of it!), basketball court, sauna & steam room, outdoor garden and running track. What doesn't this hotel have, right? If we weren't limited on time, I would've liked to actually use all the amenities. Best of all... they allow check out time as late as 6pm!! (depends on availability)... 6pm! That's practically a whole 'nother day/night. We didn't have to rush out of the hotel early with no where to go and luggages in tow. Although, I felt kinda bad because the house cleaner wanted to finish our room so she could leave for the day... I would definitely recommend this hotel. Location is away from the noise and people, but still close enough to enjoy what Chicago has to offer.;5;4;3;2;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

Their restaurant Filini was delicious. We had breakfast there. A little pricey but worth it. Only drawback was that they never left regular coffee and my husband needs his caffeine in the morning. I called for some but no one ever showed. Thank goodness for the CVS downstairs. Overall a very nice stay and conveniently located in the heart of the city and right next to millennium park.

1047;6/28/2012;iIwdEKr0fvXhiBTCAQZOQg;CCttyvIH2jNvdE6k2wyA9g;I stayed here in March on my first visit to Chicago, and it was fantastic. It is definitely my favorite hotel I have ever the stayed at. The staff were very polite and kind, the amenities and room features were amazing, and I could not have asked for a better experience. I loved the urban, exotic, foreign feel to the place and it was terrific. I loved the decor, it was so unique! When I was staying there, a group of architects were on a tour, so I picked up a few fun facts from them. The bricks in the lobby are from old Chicago streets! and the fireplace in the lobby is the longest fireplace in the United States. The gold decor on the one wall is handmade by a world renowned artist. It's a really neat place to stay and I really enjoyed it! The downside: it's next to a fire station. You might wake up to a siren ever now and then, but the location is really great as well. We were touring Loyola University Chicago and had nowhere to put our luggage during the tour after we checked out, so the staff were very kind and stored it for us until we were finished with our visit. Overall, I had a great experience and really enjoyed it there! It is worth the extra bucks if you're only there for a night or two. :);5;1;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

From the structure of the building to the lobby entrance down to the bathroom in the room, I was impressed.  check in was fast and worry free. They were accommodating and made sure we had what we needed. Our room was awesome! Modern, clean, and relaxing. Carpet was aqua blu which was nice with marble floors and countertops in foyer and bathroom. it was definitely worth every penny spent! Our next stay will be in an executive suite for sure.

She then floored me with the 5 star hotel price and they are only a 4 star hotel.  She also told me other events could be booked the same day,  only food can be put to the minimum (which you will only meet buying the highest priced package), and anyone can walk through the cocktail hour (the residents enter through that door).;1;2;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
1054;7/24/2012;Biijc5j7;Q-rcjUuCurPsFxe5OcHVmw;Great for business travel.  You're right downtown, an easy walk to the towers, and really not that far of a walk or short cab ride to a ton of evening dining or bar & grilles.  If you're lucky enough to get a river side room (50% chance), you can't beat the view, and as the hotel is the upper floors of an office building, you're never lower than 15. Inside amenities are normal for a Holiday Inn in a business end of town.  On the main floor is an over-priced bar but with a nice view, and a relatively attractive looking but otherwise mediocre restaurant (at least for breakfast as I didn't use it any other time).  Floor 16 hosts an indoor pool (a little small for those really into lap swimming, but otherwise just fine) and a fitness room with a good amount of cardio, some free weights, and a few awkwardly placed cable/smith setups.  You can get in a good enough exercise to do the job.   If you want more, the internal stairs are all open for use between floors 15 and 23, so you can make use of those as well. Rooms are average for a HI:OK quality mattress, smattering of lower-end wood furniture, in-room WiFi (free), mini-coffee setup, ironing board, room service, etc.   I was happy to see that the bathrooms were updated at some point.  Only thing I didn't like was the air conditioning unit from 1974 that was the size of a piece of furniture and as loud as an idling car when on (which it had to be a lot for this week of 90+ weather), but a few ear plugs to make it through the night and you're good as the rest of the hotel was nice and quiet. For the price and location, this is a great business stay.;4;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1055;9/8/2012;KW8yeGtZ;ydakqMFCPLbr9cWGpLlNew;My wife and I booked a room through Priceline from 9/6-9/10.  As you can see I'm reviewing on 9/8, because I've checked out early.  It was so bad I opted to lose the last night I prepaid on and eat the loss because it was so bad.  The one saving grace, and sole reason I'm going with 2 stars is because the hotel did refund my last day of stay. As I said we booked a room through Priceline name you own price.  We requested a room with a view.  Upon checking in they told us the room did have a view, but once we got their, it did not.  We took in the basic interior room they gave us and asked about upgrading.  They said we could upgrade for a $20 a day charge.  So we did because they hotel room was SO DATED.  If I hadn't entered in through the Chicago Sun Times building I would have thought I was in public housing. After upgrading to a King room with a view, which they also informed us that they couldn't do this for free because we booked through Priceline, we tried getting settled in.  If you didn't catch that, they saved the worst rooms in the hotel for the Priceline guests.  They penalized us for booking through a 3rd party. Be warned, the pictures posted online for this hotel show some very nice rooms.  Those were not the rooms we saw.  The hotel is so dated, it's like going back in time.  My wife described the bed linnens as scratchy.  If there was one word to accurately described this hotel it is DATED. So finally we had a room with an amazing view of downtown.  However the room is still extremely dated.  We stayed for the first two nights of our trip.  But after waking up with our backs aching from the awful, awful bed we opted to move to another hotel.  Both mornings we woke up feeling like we'd been in a wrestling match and our backs were so kinked we were literally in pain. We will never stay at this hotel again.  It was easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Chicago.;2;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1056;6/27/2012;e7C49xyPsJ0V;8UclkIRBu_0071zkBYo0Ig;I booked this trip on Priceline and snagged a great deal for the location. I called to ask for two doubles and a non-smoking room and they did give me a fair warning that since I booked through a 3rd party, that they would try their best. Did end up getting the 2 beds in a handicap accessible room. The rooms were not as renovated as you'd expect from seeing the lobby but the amenities of a nice view, pool/gym, restaurant and bar make up for that. Pros: Cool factor of a 15th floor lobby above the Chicago Sun Times building Fantastic views of the city from the bar and restaurant Open atrium lobby In hotel upscale bar and restaurant with room service options Friendly check in staff Flat screen TVs Rooms with "span the width of the room" windows with nice city views Pool and gym Lounge like lobby area for work, reading, or chatting Walkway from Merchandise Mart CTA station is priceless. You can walk straight off the CTA station through the mart and take the elevators onto the hotel lobby on the 15th floor. Cons: Really outdated rooms with sparse furniture Beds that need replacing Overpriced drinks Location is far from any dining options within walking distance except for close to River North (expensive);3;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1057;6/3/2012;-fagOTfyuBehNE5VTyPshQ;TIrOT3y33xydiOnNSqDvOA;The fact that the hotel is on the 15th floor and up gives it a fancier feel than other places, but the rooms are your typical Holiday Inn rooms. My major complaint is the counter space in the bathroom. You get one little triangle sink for all your stuff. Try that out for three girls and one guy. The staff is so nice and accommodating. We would ask the maids in the hallway for tissues boxes and towels, and they were always courteous and friendly. I love the grand entrances from the street and the lobby. The front of the taxi area looks out to the river and skyline. Perfect for pictures. The bar they have on the 15th floor has a great view as well. You can get an expensive drink and watch the sunset. There is an indoor pool and a bad and pricey hotel restaurant. If you are lucky enough to get a room with a riverfront view, your windows will probably be open 24/7 because the view is gorgeous. The location is a little far from the touristy stuff. You will probably need to take a taxi.;3;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

The room was comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet.  We faced the river and the Metra station - I thought it would be loud, but it wasn't at all. The views are the real winner here.  It was a picture each time you looked out the window. The pool was big and my kids made sure we stopped there daily. The restaurant had a great menu with some excellent french fries!  We enjoyed the lunch/dinner menus.  We had breakfast there a couple of times. The buffet was ok - but I preferred to order off the menu. The pancakes were great! I'm a big fan of the hotel bar. It was a little pricey - but worth the location!! I can't wait to stay there again!;5;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1059;5/25/2012;DJ5VuR1YTmhZPxUax1jNsg;o8xftF__XRUdbD1irfzeOw;Stayed here for one night. Not a bad place but the rooms were a little outdated and it was in an isolated area.  Since i'm from Chicago, I navigated the area pretty well but for first timers, it may have been a little challenge.  It's VERY quiet after 8pm over there. Not far from the nightlife on Hubbard Street and decent staff(except for the one guy who gave me the wrong room and had an attitude). I got a $90 room from priceline but i DO NOT recommend paying $230 which is the regular price. There is a nice bar there with a view but we didn't go there. It's a no frills, decent hotel with slow free wi-fi.  It's definitely not high-end.  Also, parking is a cool $35 outdoors FYI.;3;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1060;2/21/2012;pHEx2jGURjlxITEZDEl7Og;qNgmvqt7zuLt1g9o-TFSdg;This is a fabulous hotel! I had friends that stayed here over the weekend, and it was perfect!  (I didn't stay here, but I did visit them, saw their room, wandered around the hotel, and used the concierge service with them). I think the hotel is in a great location.  It's easy to get anywhere downtown, in river north, or off the brown line. This place has amazing views!  The views from the rooms are stunning, the views from the bar are incredible, the views from random areas in the lobby are outstanding.  Really, the view is that great. The room was nice. I think what makes this place amazing is the staff.  I got a flat on my bike on the way to visiting them.  Since there are no gas stations particularly close, I thought I would see if the hotel's garage had an air compressor/some type of pump.  We asked the concierge.  The concierge called the engineer, but didn't get a response, so he called the nearby Ace Hardware and quoted me 2 pumps.  We didn't get to Ace until they had closed.  So when we returned from dinner we asked the concierge to ask the engineer again.  He called the engineer down to meet with us.  The engineer was able to blow up the tire.  The staff were so friendly and so helpful!   My friends had a great time, and plan to stay here again anytime they need a hotel in the city in the future! Oh, parking is $40 per night, while that's a lot, it's not crazy for the area.;5;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1061;12/9/2011;LX3-FghX2prh2zzD5UdHXg;GgZqf8LIFvi7rEsmYdAZoQ;I recently got married and had my reception at the Wolf Point Ballroom at Holiday Inn Merchandise Mart Plaza. First of all, the views are of downtown Chicago are breathtaking.  I'm not being biased but I really think the views from the ballroom are the best in the city.  You get views of both branches of the Chicago river. It's beautiful during the day and even more amazing at night.  Our guests complimented us all night long about the view. It's pretty incredible. Next the food is really delicious! We got married on a Friday and had the celebration buffet package.  The package itself is pretty reasonable and the food was delicious. We had Caesar salad, prime rib, chicken, mashed potatoes, fruit, and grilled vegetables. Everything was super delicious. The prime rib and the chicken were juicy and very tasty. The cake, which we got through the package from Alliance bakery was very moist and delicious. We got compliments on the food/cake from our guests as well :D Last but definitely not least, the Event Coordinator, Barbara Martin is just fabulous. She is organized, responds promptly and is very nice to work with.  She was one of the reasons we booked the venue. We knew with Barbara that we would be in good hands. Throughout the planning process we had great communication and she was extremely helpful getting things in order the day of the wedding. The Holiday Inn was recently remodeled with the newly added Wolf Point room. I think the secret is now getting out on how great it is.  The prices are very reasonable for a downtown venue. I think choosing the Holiday Inn as our venue was the best decision we made in our planning process;5;5;1;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1062;5/8/2012;AMy3x9fIXcC8Dr0WndHpYA;UXYOU58Cx4pE6zlibX2mKA;One of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Reserved a non-smoking room, king bed with a view, got a room that reeked of cigar smoke with no view.  When we complained we were moved to a smaller room, no view and double beds.  Again complained and were "comped" a meal that was average at best.  Then had a hard time getting a coffee pot for the room (I believe that they thought we'd stolen one) and getting housekeeping to change our room within the 6 hours we were out at a conference.  Holiday Inn is not a place I'd recommend to others if they are looking for a good experience.;1;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1063;4/1/2012;YOK2lsr3Z2jULYku8;L8UvESNuRmsfVbPHnZPtvQ;For-a-fee self-parking was the only option, expensive ($39 per night) and inconvenient (clerk claimed to have validated parking for two nights, but did not, so it held up my departure the following morning due to the parking gate not opening for me). Poor room size, furnishings, and amenities. Very poor view (interior 'courtyard' view of pool roof and concrete wall only). The separate main atrium had a very cold appearance and feel, could use color and/or planters in the 10+ levels of visible corridors. Clothes iron leaked water all over my dress shirt in the morning, so I had to reuse a shirt from the previous day, which is important not to do when visiting clients, or even coworkers. The clerk I brought the faulty iron to did not even ask what she could do to make my stay better, let alone apologize for the inconvenience. The front desk staff member who re-validated my parking was rude and confrontational. I waited in line for 5 minutes to re-validate something that was supposed to have been done the night before, and while 2 visitors were awaiting me in my rental car in the parking lot below. She initially said "no way" to being able to validate the parking, since I was going to spend that second night with my family nearby, even though 3 members of my party were staying the night at the same Holiday Inn. Finally, when the supervisor was involved, he took care of me right away. Validating a parking ticket should not be brain surgery, but the first clerk and the second "rude" one seemed to not understand the system or customer service at all. To add insult to injury, the self-serve breakfast BUFFET was $22, and they had the gall to include a line item for tip in the breakfast bill. I stayed/ate at a Hilton Garden Inn the previous two mornings, and their $11 breakfast buffet was better than this, and neither was much better than the FREE breakfast buffet at a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express. One last complaint: the business center charges for printing (except for boarding passes). Overall, this was the worst hotel stay that I have had in many years. "Value" was definitely missing from this particular hotel, even if my experience might not be representative of the whole chain. My preoccupation with these negative points brings forth a disturbing trend: hotels are keeping room charges at an apparently reasonable rate, but then are gouging guests with expensive parking rates, sky-high breakfast prices, extra-cost printing and sometimes internet service. In the end, it is better to stick with the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express, which include these items as standard.;1;2;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1064;7/24/2012;0;wFhQTACSsLrNDQl3jZrp-g;Great for business travel.  I had a great room with a view of the river.  I was worried because my room was right in front of the elevators, but it was not a problem I couldn't hear anything outside of my room. The woman that checked us into our rooms, was  rather rude and unattentive to our needs.  She didn't even tell us what elevator to take to get to our rooms, other than that we had a very good tray.;4;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1065;8/28/2011;DfsuYBtACpvx2ijLZe21Gw;Rxcw9-BUHnPM5H10HjxSJg;We did our hotel room block here at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Considering your not in the room a whole lot, they offered the best rate around! Rooms were great, everyone received a room with a view of the river which are great views! Room sizes were larger than the typical room too. We were given a corner room, very nice! Beds are comfortable, with your choice of pillow (soft or firm). There is an indoor pool too, which our nephews enjoyed. I walked in there once and it was nice, not overwhelming hot or chlorine smelling as most indoor pools tend to be. Large open lobby great for meeting up and taking wedding photo's. Lobby bar is nice too, which they had later hours. Pizza is good in there as well. Overall I would recommend the hotel for others, it's away from the mag mile and all the regular touristy area's however it's perfect for wedding room blocks for reasonable price!;4;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1066;5/20/2012;QVBSmc4iPRPw1yHaN3ZpcA;BJbrNSxZz8Kd6nQq8XAY4g;Reserved 3 rooms this past weekend(5/18/12-5/20/12) for a bachelor party in the city. Rooms themselves were fantastic. Although I received the WORST customer service of my life. I had to call three time during the week to put my friends names on each room so they could check in early. Every time I called they said my name was still on the rooms. I had them change it twice and when my friends got there to check in, my name was STILL on the rooms. I was also told I would get a discounted rate with 2 free breakfasts for EACH room. When my friends checked in, the discounted price was only on one room and it had to changed to all three.  I booked these rooms all together and I had the confirmations stating the prices.  When we tried to get the 2 free breakfasts on Saturday morning they said it was for only one room. I asked to talk to a manager and expressed what I was told over phone and she told me that was not what was said and basically called me a liar. What happened to the customer always being right?  I mean I was trying to scam anyone, just trying to get what I was told I was I supposed to get.  Upon checkout, the front desk person tried to charge me for 4 rooms when I only had 3. I thought we were good once I told him I only had 3. Well when I got home and checked my account, I had 4 charges from the Holiday Inn. We spent a good deal of money at this hotel and did not get the service we should have been given. I am very disappointed with this hotel. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again!!!!! Terrible!;1;2;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1067;9/13/2011;7Wlpbv0KaFtW2yprKaIPBQ;Xy6iRr-bcxssG8lOY0tRnQ;Bare-bones hotel in terms of room and amenities but the view is just absolutely spectacular. Met all my expectations and certainly exceeded it with the bar and the view.;4;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1068;7/14/2010;U0bZgywsjDH1axC94digJg;fj8dGSXNP6MDCyUagI_V7w;We recently stayed here for my sister's wedding.  The actual wedding reception was nice enough, as was our room.  However, I have never experienced more abominable customer service in my natural life than what we received here. We reserved over the phone because my sister had a block of rooms reserved at a slightly reduced rate for the wedding guests.  I received an email a couple days before, confirming my reservation.  I was in the bridal party, so I was tied up after the ceremony, and left it to my fiancé to check us in.  As we were out taking photos, he called me in a slight panic telling me that the hotel did not have our reservation.  I said they had just sent me an email and to check again. When we arrived back at the hotel, I got in line to see what the issue was and to try to check in.  The woman looked it up again and said she didn't have it.  When I told her about the confirmation email, she said "We don't do that" (not true).  She said I would just have to get into my email and get my confirmation number. She then told me that she had a line of people behind me she needed to help, and basically ordered me to leave the front desk area, implying she needed to help her "real" customers!! Because of the hotel's crappy internet I could not get online.  My sister, the bride, who had a million other things to worry about, had to track down the hotel wedding planner, who took me into her office to get on my email.  In looking at the reservation, I saw that they had misspelled my last name.  Now, mind you, they had pulled up our reservation block at the desk and were apparently too inept or lazy to glance through the list and find my name- even though it was misspelled, it was only by ONE LETTER!!  There were only about 20 of us in the block, and they didn't even bother to go through the names one at a time to see if I was there. At this point we asked for the manager. We were missing the reception, and were getting pretty upset. He apologized (kind of) and told us he would have a porter bring my fiancé's bags to our room so that we could go and enjoy the reception. Upon returning to our room late that night, we discovered that none of the bags had been brought up as promised!!!  This included valuable items such as a laptop and camera.  We called the front desk and were told that WE would have to come down and get them.   The final straw was that when I had gone down in the morning for brunch (at $20, a total and complete ripoff, but that's where the wedding party was meeting so I had no choice), I asked at the desk if we could have a slightly later checkout time (1:00 instead of noon) because we were still recovering from the night before.  They said sure, no problem, but then at noon ON THE DOT they were banging on our door. I can't even fathom how the service might have been worse.  The only slightly redeeming thing was the wedding planner helping me out- if it hadn't been for her, I don't know how we would have worked anything out.;1;7;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1069;7/29/2008;Orj5vhCunAmohp9xme7A1w;BWoIzHQKl9lyJSRYHxoMVw;Attended a wedding here a few weeks back and overall it was pretty decent.  We enjoyed the Cityscape Bar quite a bit, it's a nice layout w nearly floor to ceiling windows allowing for some great views, right at the bend in the Chicago river.   The food from the reception was above average, considering it was wedding food where it's rarely memorable.  I think it was a NY strip with potatoes and veggies.  The steak a bit overcooked (still v flavorful) but again, to expect a 5 star dining experience when the staff is tasked w serving hundreds of people at the same time, is a stretch and unrealistic.  In fact, I would recommend this place as an option to those who would consider doing a wedding reception here.;3;3;1;1;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1070;9/29/2011;w4jn5wkxIHP-eb6-HNU9Jw;9JzKI1cbMXdDGHNxpHy6pw;This place did exceed my expectations. Good location. Its a huge and upscale hotel yet affordable. Its much more impressive than other Holiday Inns and added perk of lots of shops in the same building. Well-dressed people everywhere. The skyscraper city aerial view is indeed breathtaking! The food in the hotel is also impressive and has a good organic selection.;5;2;3;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1071;11/30/2008;5NRQIY95mVaXVcLEU1i9zQ;WFpj0EMLr4klgohKVz-zoQ;I had my wedding here and it was AMAZING! Everything from the moment I viewed the space through writing the last check was a fantastic experience. Barbara Martin is incredible. She is so calm, professional, attentive, and relaxed me whenever I spoke with her. The food is great, and the view from the ballroom takes your breath away! I had a 5:00 November wedding ceremony and reception here and everyone could not stop talking about how fabulous it was. I was so happy I decided to get married here. The Cityscape bar is great, great views too. You can go straight to the merchandise mart and never go outside, which is great for elderly guests and also makes for great pictures. AND the Bridal Suite is soooooo cool. It's two stories and has spiral staircase. I felt so special all weekend. I can't gush enough about how fantastic, incredible, and special my wedding weekend here was! You will not regret working with Barbara and the Holiday Inn for your event!;5;7;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1072;7/23/2007;iMBDTZintkgDxxkjv0D4mA;Hj8XSXWjcvuz7dE7udjnvg;This is a weird place.  First of all, you walk into what looks to be an office lobby and wander around until you figure out that you have to take an elevator up eight floors to the real hotel lobby.  But once you leave the cold, sterile feel of the office building-ish entrance and standard elevator car, be prepared to be transported to the warm, exotic environment of....florida.  Yes people, this is a Holiday Inn, so you will be surrounded by shades of pink, purple, and turquoise, and other colors and patterns that only a guy wearing a straw hat, hawaiian shirt, black socks, and sandles could love.  Despite its really cool location, this is a holiday inn and feels old and worn down throughout its interior.  Not going into details, but not a good value for its price. I'm giving this one a slightly below average rating because on one hand its tucked into a nice spot on a bend of a river so if you just so happen to get a corner suite you can look down the river west and watch the trains go in and out of the Oglivie transportation center, or you could look north as the happy northsiders go about their business.  On the other side it remains a standard issue Holiday Inn. Pros: * nice location on the cusp of the loop * river views * set away from busy streets and no real low floors Cons: * outdated interior * ugly interior * holiday inn interior Bottom line is that there's a lot of potential here, but for the price they charge, it doesn't deliver.;2;3;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1073;5/5/2009;Ct80zrOgWpeRPiQXB1gcgA;gKsC2S3A6S649Tgg8kd0Qw;Got a pretty decent deal on Priceline with "name your own price" at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza.  The location is fantastic: close to a variety of el trains, the loop, and other neighborhoods and shopping.  The views are beautiful and the bar is a great place to unwind as the sun sets and the city lights come on. However, I've had better experiences at other hotels.  Upon checking in, the front desk continuously tried to up sell me.  It would cost another $20/night to have a room on the outside, that had a view.  We declined, and got a nice room with absolutely no view in the interior corridor of the hotel.  They also claimed there were no rooms with king size beds unless we upgraded.  I'm not sure if they could see the price we paid, but if so, is there a certain price threshold that grants you access to the nicer rooms?  I'd be pretty upset if I paid close to regular price on priceline but still had to pay another $20/night for a nice view. But if you won't be hanging out in your room much, this hotel may be a good bet.  The fitness center and pool were pretty large and were open from 6AM - 11PM.  The bar had a happy hour which included a complimentary buffet of jalapeno poppers, wings and a crudite platter.  The bartenders were friendly and made some excellent cocktails.   The only other minus was since this is on top of a convention center, it is somewhat hard to get to.  You enter the doors, go down a hall, take an elevator to the 9th floor, cross over to the other side of the lobby, and then take an elevator to your floor.  Not the most convenient entry.  Just break up the long trek with a drink at the bar, and it's worth it.;3;2;1;1;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1074;3/29/2010;U0brAZrx2RFGf5T8k;D8Do2zhD3s3GT5_DA-vF7Q;We just had our wedding here and it was awesome.  You are in awesome hands with Barbara.  We wouldn't change one thing about the wedding, how it was handled, how organized it was, etc.  It was perfect.  We had some complicated details and everything was set-up perfect.  The food was awesome, the cake got a ton of compliments, the views are incredible, the newly renovated rooms were nice.

The hotel is very easy to find and has great views. Its clean and updated. Not alot of frills or bells and whistles which is fine. I didnt pay for that. I got free parking which was the deciding factor to booking with easy in and out anytime I wanted. The pool is very nice even if a little cold. Work out room was up to date and clean. Lobby restaurant and bar were just fine as well.  Great views from the bar if you are over 21.   No in room fridge or mini bar, but like I said I didnt pay for that and didnt need it.  Free wi fi.

1077;6/3/2011;e72Q;0aPIhvzpYHy5UmZOiNt28w;I had my wedding here on 5/14/11, and I was very pleased with the entire event.  From start to finish, Barbara Martin, the catering manager, was very easy to work with and very accommodating.  The view from the Wolf Point Ballroom is great.  It looks out over the river and makes this more than just another hotel ballroom.   Another nice surprise was that the food was amazing.  I don't tend to expect much of wedding food, but I must say that ours was delicious.  We chose chicken napoleon with roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.   I had people telling me all night that they loved it.  The cake (from Alliance Bakery) was included in our package and that was great, too.  And I didn't have to do any coordinating.  The bakery dealt directly with Barbara.   The rooms that they blocked out for us were also very nice.  The rooms for both sets of parents were free, as was our bridal suite which was spectacular.  It was huge, had a nice view of the city, and there was free champagne and cookies waiting for us.  We, and our parents, also got free breakfast the next morning.   I definitely recommend having an event there.  We really wanted a downtown wedding and at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza we were able to get it without spending a crazy amount of money.;5;2;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

When I came here for my buddy's wedding, I booked a room through priceline.  They stuck me with a smoking room. Totally disgusting. The front desk lady said, "on the bright side, we're giving you a really good room with a view." The view was nice, but it was disgusting because the the smoke smell was suffocating. It smelled like a bar, and I think my clothes came out smelling like smoke too. I would rate the place higher if it wasn't for that.  I think they gave plenty of us nonsmokers in line smoking rooms.  I'm not sure if it was bc we used priceline or what. Usually most upscale hotels are nonsmoking anyway. Anyway, thank goodness it was only for one night.;2;0;1;1;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1079;1/14/2009;tcgTHEaQ9e;E5KZfaq9g1h3zgT3ivwRlQ;I would come here again if only for the view - it was awesome. We were in an east facing room and got a great view of the right break of the river and the merch mart itself. At night all over the city had colored lights (but wisely turned them off somewhere around midnight) and it was just gorgeous. Great location too. It was a quick inside walk to the Purple and Brown lines, breakfast was a short ways away also, and it was a good central location to a lot of activities. The one issue we encountered was finding dinner - it seems to be a very business area so most restaurants close around 4pm so we had to cab it places (it was 10 degrees). If you are there in the summer and walk or just don't mind dropping $7-10 on a cab all the time then it's great. (I'm a city walker but the weather was a bit prohibitive) The pool was nice (once they got the heater working) and they had a well stocked gym and a nice sauna. The price was reasonable for an inner-city hotel. To my friends' delight we were there during a conference of teenage girls so they got to be dirty old men sitting in the lobby one night....I Yelped...;4;0;0;2;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1080;7/16/2009;WaGffZamf3CRHdiS0wNdCQ;Yi-lUQhJ14wWqZY709S_Jw;The price is right and the hotel is fairly convenient. It is within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. There is also a bus stop right around the corner which is convenient if you will be heading a bit outside of downtown.  There is also an excellent view of the city from the hotel. However, if you are looking for a place that you'll be able to take advantage of the wireless Internet, this may not be right for you. I had plans to do some work while away on business, but unfortunately, the signal from my room was at one bar. It was very difficult to go on. If you do head down to the lobby area, you will find a Cyber Cafe with a much higher signal. For me, I wanted to be in the comforts and privacy of my room, so this did put a damper on my stay. Overall, it is a nice hotel for the price. The staff was friendly, the fitness center and pool areas were well maintained, and they were also open from 6am - 11pm, which is rather accommodating.;3;0;1;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

If you can at all, request a river view.  Or room #1612.  It is a corner room that is more like a suite in terms of size.  The major attraction is the view of the Chicago River- you get both the east-west and the north-south branch, plus the gorgeous 333 Wacker Building across the water, the L trains, Merchandise Mart, boats and the many bridges.  The furnishings are ok, the bathroom not updated, but who cares when you get this much space and an amazing view! Can't comment on the food served here.  There are plenty of options close by (not so much for a sit-down breakfast) or you can get chain-restaurant food court next door in the Merchandise Mart.   Or hop on the L and get out of River North for a spell.;4;0;0;1;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

1083;3/24/2011;cw9oloLk5YcjwSdqq14vzw;IRDcFm3yima9phCOUfCU0A;I just booked my wedding here for the fall of this year in the Wolf Point Ballroom.  HOLY COW, best kept secret in Chicago if you are a bride on a budget but still want an urban downtown wedding.  Their per head prices are phenomenal and for the location, and all that is included, I am still in disbelief at the deal we got.  Our wedding is on a Friday and we received an awesome discount on top of everything else being amazing at this place.  check out their wedding packages on their website. The ballroom isn't your typical wedding hotel event space, which we TOTALLY did not want but this place is sweet! it has all glass windows surrounding 1/2 the room which face the west for a pretty sunset and the south looking at 333 wacker and the rest of the beautiful skyline....it's great, you get the benefits of having your reception at a hotel but don't have to have the "ballroom" vibe If you're wedding budget is around $20,000 just to cover your reception costs, check this place out for a 200 person wedding, because you can have an awesome downtown wedding for less than that which is really affordable!! I can't wait to write another review of how awesome this place is once the wedding actually happens.;5;2;1;2;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
1084;6/21/2010;cz4J3FUci0;qL8RwBOAwXJ5VSkR-DWl5g;I was in a wedding and the reception was here. The reception service and food was good. However while everyone loved the steak, they did not like the chicken. The cake was bad (dry, tasteless, even the frosting). I mention the latter because the hotel provides the cake. We had some room issues the first night, but the staff accommodated us and  slashed the first rate night in half. Thank you manager Ben! Room service food was great. Bath towels were scratchy. The views are beautiful. Get a drink at the bar, whether or not you are   staying at the hotel. Parking requires you to schlep up and down a steep stairwell.

I'll have to say that the view was wonderful and for the price we paid through http://priceline.com, really a steal. The rooms are a tad dated, but again for the price, you can't beat it. The bedding and pillows were comfortable. The hotel needs to overhaul the 80's wallpaper and get fresh, fluffy towels for the bathrooms to compete with other business downtown.  We will both stay again as it's centrally located and priced so well.;3;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

The rooms are standard, with the corner rooms getting some more space. There are no "low floor" rooms here. The indoor pool can be very crowded, usually with kids.;4;3;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

1094;4/13/2010;GcbB8HMg-W;YoejZWcd86pa_Nj-Bo8TMA;My review is specifically about the 17th floor rooms. I think all the other floors have been remodeled and the rooms are probably decent. But if you're lucky enough to get a 17th floor room like I did, you will be sorely disappointed. These are probably the ugliest, most outdated rooms (and bathrooms) in Chicago that still cost $170 a night. What a complete ripoff - not what you expect when you see the modern lobby. The front desk experience was unfriendly, and the hotel internet is horrid. Don't even think about VPN - you'd be lucky to have 2 webpages load up simultaneously on your browser. Not even the incredible river view is enough to save this whole experience. Hilton Honors - please take me back.;2;1;1;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

The bathroom was a little old in appearance but everything worked fine.  The room was likely dated but these things don't bother me if I can get a good night's sleep.  Noise from below was at a minimum but this might be that I was facing the river.  Location is great with the metro just outside the place.  You can walk through the attached buildings and not go outside. Didn't try the bar but it did look like a nice view.  The hotel was going through some renovation but that didn't seem to affect anything.   The staff was friendly and helped pick some places to eat that night.;4;1;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

No other place I know does this! Big kudos for that.).  Forget the "Holiday Inn" brand you may be familiar with....as most have said this location is a delightful surprise.  The 15th floor space is great for smaller weddings, but I think the space can be modified for different numbers of guests.;5;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

1102;9/11/2012;xkPpaBTTVwIxfqH8bpqqSw;CFZaOTdhqXgrbtqx5vCIIg;When you stay at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Ave in Chicago, you get exceptional service from the minute you check in. The rooms are super clean and the plush beds are so comfortable you'll want to order breakfast in bed.   But don't!  The breakfast buffet is SO amazing (some rooms include it, complimentary, so ask at check in) you will want to enjoy everything on the buffet...and you won't be needing food until dinner (if even then) once you've finished! I want to expound on this a bit because this awesome breakfast buffet is a good enough reason alone to stay here (but the other amenities are superior, too!).   The $28.00 price tag is COMPLETELY WORTH IT!  Remember, you will likely NOT need another meal that day.   Not only does this buffet have  the traditional fresh omelets and Belgian waffles to order,  but it had TWO different types of smoked salmon (complete with condiments- capers/onions/cream cheese, etc):an array of fresh bagels/breads/muffins, etc:a fresh assortment of fruits, brie and other delicious ($$) cheeses:amazing "Crab-cakes Benedict":bacon, sausage (YUM!) and scrambled eggs that were so creamy, it left me wanting to speak with the chef about how he did that en masse!   I'm so impressed with this buffet (can you tell??)!  I have traveled the world and eaten at countless fine restaurants and I would be hard pressed to find a breakfast buffet that compares to this one.  ...perhaps the Auberge St. Antoinne in Quebec, but I digress.   The point is, this hotel (and breakfast buffet) is WORLD CLASS, as is the staff who work there.  Michael Jordan's Bar (in the hotel) has amazing burgers and macaroni & cheese and the hotel itself is something to behold, from the indoor coliseum-like pool area (which you can order drinks to) :) to the Grand Ballroom that houses the largest (12,000 lb) Baccarat crystal chandelier in North America.   All of this equals something to behold in this remarkable hotel.   OH!  And it's entrance opens up onto Michigan Avenue in Chicago...enough said!! Just stay there!!  You WON'T be disappointed!;5;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1103;9/7/2012;UB-o2m6Sjr-jVZLy4VYTWg;RCpuxT8sMB4-NjnQeimXog;Lovely historical hotel. I enjoyed its location the most - right on Michigan Ave. in the heart of the bustling traffic! Oh yes, this is the city for sure. But I loved every bit of it. I also thought that the rooms were pretty comfortable, as I stayed with two of my family members. The hotel employees pretty much helped out but mostly minded their own business which is a nice gesture, as some of us want to relax after a long day out sightseeing/or shopping. Our huge fam frequented the "Michael Jordan" lounge too, as it was conveniently located right next to the lobby. In addition to that, during the mornings, we would also load up on coffee at the Starbucks that is attached to the hotel. Enjoyed my stay and would love to come back again:maybe I'll take my significant other next time! There is a possibility that we may come back sooner than later. :);4;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1104;8/23/2012;uYKq0WPnO;bnPpoAsVbULVN8EsUYGGCA;I recently made the best discovery since Columbus: to stay at a hotel on North (and specifically North) Michigan Ave, you'd have to pay an arm and a leg, or maybe all four of them. If it weren't for consistently stalking internet deals, I'd be staying all the way in the South Side. Here's the thing about my hotel standards: don't care about fanciness, just be clean, roach/rat-free so I don't have nightmares and most of all, proximity. Intercontinental was quite accessible (as in walking distance) to the main attractions in Chicago, was clean and not as fancy as I had imagine it would be. I checked in early since I had an early flight arrival and was told I would be given a call/message when a room is available. Maybe I misinterpreted their implications by giving a call before the 3:00 p.m. usual check-in hour. When the clock hit 3:25, there was still no call but an immediate room when I stormed down there. I was placed in a room in the Main Building, with the whole Historical Building blocking my view of the Chicago River, not that I care too much  about it since I was barely in my room. Turn-off #2: No shower caps or slippers. I've been to cheaper hotels and they would provide them if you ask. Even after calling the front desk, which directed me to some other irrelevant service that made a "note", I never got my shower cap. Turn-off #3: Housekeeping. While the ladies do work hard to keep the room nice and tidy, their impatience really annoys me. I would get knocks on my door at 8 a.m. - 9 a.m. every morning, asking if we were ready. No, I am in the middle of my five-hour nap and I'm on vacation, so I will not wake up as if I'm going to work. The fridge was a bit of a problem, seeing I could only fit things up to the size of 2 cans. Only buy small things you know you can fit up to or if you want to do it like I did, place everything on top. Or go all the way down to the 7th floor to grab ice. The ice room is pretty disgusting with the dirty dishes lying around. I've read so many complaints about the paid wi-fi prior to booking, but here's a trick and pay attention carefully: take your laptop, iPad, ipaq by the Starbucks downstairs, connect to the wifi and toy around with it for a few minutes and it will last you throughout the whole night and morning in your room! Not bad, eh? The staff here are very nice and the place is very clean. The staff at the front door are especially friendly and kind. This hotel isn't too bad, especially for the perfect location.;3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1105;7/16/2012;D9-DN898hwg7hpm1ccTFbQ;Pdonq1baFlxbILXb95ckbA;Not good. First room had a broken shower. Second room had a funny smell that never did go away. Walls are paper thin and we were awoken each night by about 12 giggling party people coming in at 3am and continuing the par-tay in the room next door. At one point I could hear someone coughing through the walls. That's right--just a cough. So you can imagine that 12 drunk people effectively shut down any more sleep, even after we called security. The rooms are in severe need of a refresh--dusty and dated. Not charmingly dated--more like udpated sometime in the mid 90s and in desperate need of a facelift. These stars are for the location, which is fantastic, and the lobby, which all marble and really pretty. This hotel is expensive for what you get and next time we're going to stay somewhere more modern.;2;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1106;5/3/2012;LOhmt6nMljpX0TKMm7Uo-Q;EQQ72oAe3XIMyJA1Y5KCtw;When I got there, I found I had to share a room with a stranger (my co-worker I hadn't met).  The company asked for a double bed room not single.  When I went to the front desk the guy seemed uninterested in what I was telling him and got smart with me.  Then, told me he couldn't help me "sorry, we are sold out." They were not sold out so he lied.  I had to get my manager involved for them to do anything for me.  Then, he had to get management involved. Finally, they put us in a double room. It was small but better than a small room with one bed. Be prepared to pay for forks and spoons when you get there.  I think they probably charge for everything but the forks and spoons are $5.74.  You could get a fast food meal with that or one of their drinks in the refrigerator. BTW, the frig is small and they load it with stuff you have to pay for.  So make sure when you take it out, you put it back.   If you have a long stay there, you won't be getting a microwave either, FYI. I tried not to bother the front desk much since they seemed to unfeeling:however, the bar people were great! I spend a lot of time at the restaurant and bar.   Their Starbucks in there are slow too, they made me late for my bus when all they had to do was heat up my egg sandwich.  Took them ten minutes and they knew I was waiting.  They didn't do anything but refund my money or my inconvenience.  Not sure if that has anything to do with the hotel but it is connected to the hotel.   I learned to go across the street after that which was not far from the bus stop.   Other than that the hotel was okay! Not the best but okay.;2;1;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

This time I was in Chicago on business for one night. My co-worker and I saw the valet parking at the curb in front of the hotel but no one was there, so we opted to find the garage ourselves. That was tricky. It is located behind the building and underground. Take a right on E. Ohio Street, right on N. St, Clair, and then another right into the underground garage looking thing. The 505 Michigan Ave. parking will be on the left. Parking for one night was $57 (ouch!) but it was come and go as you please and was good until 5:00pm the following day. The employees at the front desk were friendly, as were the bellhops. We inquired about late check-out, and the latest they could offer us was 2:00pm if we signed up for their free rewards program. Eh, why not? I travel enough or work anyway. It's also good at Holiday Inn/Express, people. The room was nice (King bed). I really liked the soft music playing on the computer screen. It helped me sleep by drowning out some of the street noise. The pillows were nice and fluffy. I was really bummed that there was a fee to use the gym. I mean, I could understand the fee for wireless, parking, etc. But for the gym?? That made me sad. I love to work out and I wasn't about to pay almost $20 to use the gym for one day. Otherwise, the location can't be beat. Right near a lot of shopping and restaurants. You did A-OK, Intercontinental, Chicago.;3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1114;6/1/2012;cIiK-Q;jWbS5rrHoq69vKzKE837aw;The InterContinental Hotel Chicago has a rich history as one of the city's great landmarks of Freemasonry because it used to be the Medinah Shriners Temple private athletic club at a time when Freemasonry was incredibly popular and the Shriners used to conduct incredible parades and pageantry throughout Chicago. This building is particularly interesting because the symbolic features are so prominently and beautifully displayed. As you walk up the grand staircase you will see very ornate columns and images from a time when the Near East represented all that was magical and mystic which glorious images of Crusaders and Moors. The pool is particularly worth viewing given the chance as are the upstairs ballrooms. Take your time viewing and enjoy the treasures you're guaranteed to discover!;4;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

I tend to be pretty clutzy and if it weren't for my boyfriend coming in to hand me a razor I was more then likely going to fall on my ass.

Minus the room mix-up I'd definitely stay at another Intercontinental hotel again.;4;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1117;10/26/2011;DF9QFTHcV5nmtnlsOUJ7yQ;BFBB1kC7dpD2Ek_XxjdmTw;I stayed here while my bf was on a business trip. It's centrally located, near to the train, the river, the sights, restaurants, shopping, etc. Walk outside, and downtown Chicago is right there for your enjoyment. I think I'd rate 3.5 stars if I could. I was really happy with the bed, because usually no matter how nice a hotel I stay in, I toss and turn all night long. I pretty much slept like a (semi-drunk) rock here, I am pleased to report. The room was very small, but fairly nice. I'd agree that it's not a four star hotel - more like 3. I dunno if I'd stay here again, but I don't really have anything bad to say about it. My room was free, however, and I don't think I'd pay more than $200/night for this place, if that. Maybe I'm cheap? It's been a while since I've paid for a hotel room in the US since my bf travels a lot for business... I like how they have a touch screen computer thingy in the room - that was pretty cool.;3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1118;2/29/2012;TtuaK3dHdnj6KmHcW7e7Qg;YWQ591DjKNywglXCn2PANw;Shockingly terrible.  I come to Chicago maybe once a month for business and typically have enjoyed the Trump.  This place was recommended by my travel people, as close to office, nice etc. What I encountered are rude staff, a tiny room with no amenities, $7 bottles of water, a weird touch screen and tiny TV.   There are no towel racks in bathroom.  Turn down service was nonexistent.  Internet is $17 a night, shouldn't that be free by now? The hotel is massive and there are no personal touches to make you feel more at home which are essential when traveling for work. Needless to say I will never stay here again and will recommend all my colleagues to avoid.;1;1;0;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1119;9/12/2011;VkExWvUKxRPBHZgoDt-FKw;Wn_u2lJgtW4256m3hIU9Aw;We stayed at the historic tower and I can definitely see why it is called historic. The pipes in that building are so old, every time I shower it sounded like something one of the pipes would burst any second. Also the air conditioner sucked, we had it on the lowest settings but the room would never get cold. Only pros about this place is the location.;3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1120;11/7/2011;1ZZTPsEd2;epB3Jy-nh4TFi4i0NZN8nw;I am a career event planner and have been planning and operating events for over 13 years. The InterContinental Hotel Chicago is one of my absolute favorite venues. I operated a very high end, high profile event for my (then) employer, and it was executed to perfection. My bosses and attendees were thrilled with the event. The location cannot be beat. This hotel is the only one in the city with a street level lobby on Michigan Ave. The service is impeccable, and the facilities are gorgeous. I would give a full five stars, but some of the rooms in the new tower are a bit on the small side. If at all possible, try to stay in the historic tower. OH! and an insider tip! Be sure to ask the concierge about the self guided ipod tour of the property... it's an open secret that you will love to take advantage of. Another tip, if you need to catch a cab to take you south of the river, cross the street before you grab one. It will save you a few bucks over getting it from the hotel cab stand.;4;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1121;1/18/2011;vdcjID3WjboJSPgWP0snQg;jwbcs_eQ2QznrOyMuqz1LQ;Oh man.  I'm pretty torn on this one. So...beautiful hotel, accommodating staff.  Luxurious in an understated, traditional sort of way.  (Sometimes trendy is *too* trendy...see also: W Hotel Chicago!)  And I can dig quiet luxury.  Attention to detail.   Seriously, super nice staff.  (Bonus points for the day manager being from MKE and knowing my Riverwest neighborhood!) Here's the but.  You knew it was coming. BUT... Two strikes and you're down from your four stars to three.  Well, two and-a-half strikes, actually.  I really want to give the Intercontinental 4 stars...but I can't.  Here's why. Strike 1: First night, I return from dinner in the hopes of relaxation and a nice nightcap at "Eno" (the hotel's wine/chocolate/cheese spot).  After extensively perusing the insanely awesome wine list and getting my heart set on a particular glass, the girl behind the bar informs me that they'll be closing.  In 10 minutes.  So..."I can buy a bottle to take to my room...but...yeahhhh."  (Don't want/need a bottle, so no Eno for me.  No.)  Seriously?  You're a hotel bar in downtown Chicago and you're closed by 9:30?  Hrm. Strike 2:  This morning, I wake up in the hopes of hitting the Fitness Center for an early (for me!) morning jog.  Exit elevator on the level labeled FC (fitness center). Woman behind counter:  "Just looking around?" Me:  "Yeah.  I was just gonna get a quick work-out in." Her:  "Well, you're aware you have to pay, right?  16 bucks per day, or 20 to cover your usage for your entire stay.  Still want to work out?" Me (confused, internal dialogue running wild, finally indignant):  "I guess I'll just wait...?" What?  I don't get it.  I just don't. Strike 2 and-a-half: I get back from a long day out and I'm seriously crashing from massive amounts of caffeine and all I want is to take my shoes off, and my room key doesn't work.  (Sigh.)  Truck downstairs, wait in line for the one front desk worker to be able to assist me.  Key re-activated, all is well, but still.  It was sort of the straw that broke this reviewer's back. Don't get me wrong.  This place is pretty dang swanky.  It's nice.  The people are nice.  But a few too many strikes and this lady's not so apt to give that extra star.  Just sayin'.;3;5;0;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1122;6/6/2011;1wLFhoevcb6neRnCIn6alA;JPH-WOKa6EBMlpBGLIPuiw;Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. For the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...I wouldn't consider it that good. The rooms were solid. The view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave.) The service was ok. The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. We came here for a Jewish/Hindi wedding. Appetizer was fine. Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. Dessert was inedible. I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. I personally preferred the Conrad. Better prices and better service.;2;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

It's spelled I-N-T-E-R-C-O-N-T-I-N-E-N-T-A-L H-O-T-E-L. The Intercontinental Hotel provided as stop #2 on the engagement festivities surprise tour. We were upgraded to a suite in the Historical Tower, it's the only way to stay, with a generous bathroom and jacuzzi, his and hers robes and sweeping views of the Magnificent Mile from our windows. A long, dramatic hallway leads to a spacious suite, perfect for our getting ready for surprises #3 and #4 on the engagement tour, and for popping bottles of champagne in celebration. The staff was gracious and accommodating, and had I known where on earth I was going while I hastily packed my overnight bag, I would have thrown in a swimsuit to take advantage of the killer 1920's-inspired pool area, complete with lunching balconies and ornate blue tiling. (Think of Queen Sophie Ann's "day room" from True Blood). Starbucks is located on the first floor, and room service choices are elegant enough to be considered ordered on special occasions, such as an engagement : ) Five stars for making me feel like a soon-to-be blushing bride!;5;6;5;3;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1126;1/3/2007;3Hy1u1lQ;NyltIuiXtKMuqtVH85uyxQ;Instead of falling victim to an overpriced and underwhelming New Year's Eve "Bar Party" my boyfriend and I decided we would do it up nice and stay d-town in a hoighty-toighty hotel.  After much research, we settled on the Intercontinental because the price wasn't TOO outrageous and location was well, perfect.   First the bad.  Upon check-in at 3PM, my bf was presented with a "contract" promising he would not bring booze into our room. Um, OK.  Hopefully that was just a NYE thing because it was totally LAME (and I may have snucky some booze in anyway. Or not.  Shhh).   Also valet parking was 40 bones.  After the room price, that is a little steep but fair I guess for downtown 24-hour parking. As for the good, our room was very nice.  The bed was heavenly and I think I could live in it (I found refuge in those pillows as we painfully watched the Bears blow it.  Awesome we had planned our evening around that).  I also found the room to be really clean (but who really knows these days, especially after watching Dateline when they show those microscopic bugs - ew). Highlights included the bar - great people watching, especially that night because there was a wedding.  Drinks were pricey as expected but the staff was nice.  I did find a SHARD of glass in my martini before I was, oh about to swallow it (wouldn't that have been a Happy New Year?) but the bartender apologetically gave me a new one at no charge.   Shards aside, I had a good experience at the Intercontinental.  It's pretty solid and RIGHT on Michigan across from Nordstrom.  I would recommend that an out-of-towner shacks up here for a visit.;4;6;5;6;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1127;12/15/2006;tkHcXtYur2X0egs3i;B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg;I enjoyed my one night stay here, but I have one question and one question only... WHAT IS UP WITH THE SHOWERS? Who designed this. If you haven't been it's a huge walk in with a curtain you draw. You could probably fit a good 7 people in that shower, which hey, could be fun, but I can't really see the Intercontinental being "that" kind of hotel. Anyway, here you are in this second room aka the shower and as you are going about your business you pull the curtain and walk back into the bathroom to find the entire floor soaked. How was this a good idea? First of all it's dangerous. Say you were drinking heavily in the hotel (not that I would know anything about that kind of behavior), but then say you took a shower and walked out to Lake Michigan Avenue on the slick marble floor. That just spells danger to me and a waste of towels since it took all but one of the supplied towels to mop it all up. Other than that, the room was HUGE and the views were great. i stayed in the historic tower and it was nice. Also the beds. WOW. I have trouble sleeping, but man o man, did I ever wake up with the best puffy eyed face and out of control bed head. In my world, that means I actually beat insomnia for one night and won! Other than those things it's just a nice hotel that I think a business traveler would enjoy. They do charge $9.95 a day for Internet which seems lame seeing as how you are already paying over $200 for the room, I mean come on, would it kill ya to comp that, but overall a fine place to rest your head. For a romantic romp however, I may stay somewhere else. Again, not that I would know anything about that :);4;5;5;6;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1128;1/12/2010;mEGSSPkWctaxwP5KwXtFag;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;Two words. Historic tower. Yes. If you are going to stay at the Intercontinental- you must stay in the historic tower. The Intercontinental Chicago is really two hotels in one. The historic tower was built in 1929 and was originally the Medinah Athletic Club. The "north tower" or main building was actually another hotel that was built in 1961 and was acquired by the Intercontinental and joined together. Thus the style differences between the two towers. While the historic tower costs more, in my opinion, it is worth the money. Look for deals (especially if you are staying over a weekend). My room rate was only $99 a night (had a Groupon for one night and found a deal for the other) This cheap rate got me a standard room in the main tower- but after a little dealing upon check in- I was able to get a corner room in the historic tower for a nominal upgrade fee. My room was lovely. A SE corner room with two windows- one looking over the river and one facing east with views of the lake and Navy Pier. Perfect for a getaway weekend. The staff at this hotel was on their game. Late night room service came within the promised 20 minutes. The valet brought my car around in 5 minutes, turn down service was followed up on, and the doorman was quick to take care of my every need. So why not a perfect score? I think they were a little cheap in some areas and as a frequent traveler, I expect alot. I'd rather pay a little more for the room and not be "nickel and dimed" to death throughout my stay. For example- they charged $17.95 a day for wi-fi, there were no high end toiletries in the bathroom, they were missing some expected amenities (complimentary water in bottles, q-tips, shower cap and cotton balls) . Even the business center charged for wi-fi- crazy! And the worst thing? Overnight parking in the hotel cost $53 a night. That's highway robbery and the same price is given for the public as those staying in the hotel. My advice? Drop your bags off with the bellman and then park around the corner in one of the cheaper lots. All in all, the Intercontinental is a great hotel and the location can't be beat. Just know before you go that it's the little things that are going to add up during your stay so plan accordingly.;4;7;3;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1129;9/16/2009;3e0lBvneXDifNOAfJhB2Nw;-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA;The Intercontinental Chicago needs a lesson in Feng Shui. The room with double beds was small (not surprising considering it is a hotel in the city). Unfortunately the trick of using mirrors to expand a room was used ineffectively. Right next to the bed was very large mirror that took up practically the whole wall. I swear I didn't sleep well because of that. The only thing that the mirror accomplished was to highlight the circus like drapes of the room. I happened to like the whimsical decor but I didn't like having bad dreams. Unlike the mirrors in the bedroom, the Intercontinental is in an excellent location. It's right on Michigan Avenue and if you're into shopping then you're in luck. Bloomingdale's, Saks and American Girl are right next door. If you need to ride the L train it is also not too far away. The hotel has a fabulous pool fit for royalty. It's olympic sized and surrounded by Spanish tiles. The only thing missing was a poolboy who'll fan you and feed you grapes. Sadly, I was not able to spend some time poolside or in the water. The Intercontinental is a decent hotel to stay in. It's a reputable chain on the higher class end. The Chicago location, however, is slightly underwhelming.;3;3;4;4;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1130;1/5/2011;MnaZfvZdw5WvgOgk9dTHiQ;MS5HlyLidPRziEGG75QKpg;I stayed here 1/1/11 to 1/2/11 : My mini vacation in Chicago. My room was beautiful. King size bed on the 18th floor overlooking Michigan Ave. I slept like a baby here. The decore of the room was beautiful. Awesome bathroom shower with hot water and excellent pressure. Make sure you check out their pool and sauna. Their pool is on the 13 or 14th floor (FC) and has a very unique 20s look. Wooden sauna is great! Staff is extremely nice. If you are still planing to visit the museum or go to lunch after your checkout I recommend taking advantage of their complementary luggage hold at the bell stand. Also enjoy the charming lobby with stunning lion statues and comfy chairs.;5;0;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1131;9/16/2006;kCpijKnVF2ZSWRNsejPYjA;rQrqrb5dFztAeFYwyqbygA;The best characteristic about this hotel is it's location.  It also has beautiful classic architecture, and the hotel lobby is lovely.  It's funny... I can always distinguish Kimpton hotels from the decor.  Very eclectic and modern, but still has that institutional feel to it.  I think it's a good value for the money, and wold recommend it to visiting friends and tourists.   The bathroom was pretty decent in size...

1132;2/25/2008;pf-UwxxqvTYhp2vTM5zlxQ;wPif9x51jxzO8DS6h-ZY4g;***3.5 Stars*** Ok, maybe it's just me, but when I stay at a hotel with the reputation of the Intercontinental (and the price tag), I expect something special.  This hotel is really quite ordinary.  I stayed here recently for a conference and while the meeting amenities were fantastic, the hotel room itself was only mediocre at best. So, let's start with the mediocre first.  My hotel room was spacious, located in the historic tower  (I guess that's why it seemed that my room hadn't been updated in a very long time).  The bed was not comfortable and the lounge chairs were old and worn.  The rest of the furnishings were old and very used to the point of having drawer fronts askew on the desk and doors that wouldn't open properly on the TV stand.  Like I said, with a hotel of this reputation and price, I expect a comfy bed, some chairs that don't look like they've been around since 1964 and furniture that isn't out of grandma's attic. Then, there's the bathroom.  It's like they may have tried to update it at one point...and then gave up.  I had an impossible time maintaining one water temperature both in my sink and in the shower.  Imagine trading between scalding hot and lukewarm.  Gee, I'm now awake AND I've sustained 3rd degree burns.  AWESOME!  The towels were crustier than sand paper and, come on people, can we please have two-ply toilet paper??  Single ply is what I expect from your much cheaper cousin, the Holiday Inn. The redemption in the hotel room was the large, flat screen TV.  That I did enjoy (along with my $6 bottle of water). Now on to the good stuff...The meeting facilities.  These were simply wonderful.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  They accommodated all of my vegetarian meal requests without blinking an eye.  The breakfast buffet was a breakfast lover's dream - everything imaginable and all of it very tasty.  The banquet lunches were quite good and all the meat eaters enjoyed their entrees.  The rooms where we had our meetings were well maintained and very clean.  Temperature was nicely maintained as well.  I would highly recommend their meetings services and facilities.   Of course, in the end, you're paying for the location.  Yeah, that can't be beat.  It's within walking distance of just about everything the Mag Mile has to offer - great restaurants, bars, shopping...;3;2;2;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1133;5/6/2009;VQGcQiKrczXbBUaSvbfViA;KJ_0tYPk3VeoNun0s4RkBA;I enjoyed my stay at the InterContinental, which is where my work chose to host a huge meeting. Pros: - Modern, comfy King bed with 5 large, plush pillows - Decent 2-story fitness center:more extensive than other fitness centers I have been too -Downtown location:perfect for people who want to be blocks away from major shopping and running along the river Cons: - Water problems with my shower- my water would go in and out - It's REALLY big- two different "towers" and it can be a little overwhelming for people who just want to have a relaxing stay in Chicago - The ongoing drilling that occur ed during our meeting:completely unprofessional and disturbing (we should have been warned) Overall, it's a decent venue to hold a work event at, however, I would not recommend the InterContinental for a personal stay in Chicago (go to the Affinia!).;3;2;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1134;7/14/2008;jbk-ZNN-AcoP4cTEsVhLuw;Ds9kLHT1mPqzVcm_XRIXiw;Yes, it's an Intercontinental, but not quite as nice as other Intercontinentals I've stayed in.  In fact, there were a couple major flaws: (1)  The rooms are NOT soundproof.  At all.  Like I could hear the conversation in the next room.  I could hear people walking around in the hall and doors slamming.  Not great. (2)  The curtains are not lightproof.  Both curtains were drawn and I still awoke from all the light coming into the room at 6am (we were facing east so...). (3)  Crappy towels and no bathrobes. (4)  Comfy bed, but kind of scratchy sheets. (5)  Fancy looking bath products but I didn't really like them. HOWEVER...the location really can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Avenue.  About two blocks from the river.  A ~10 minute walk to most train lines. Also to note:  Breakfast at the hotel is $23 for a buffet.  Not unexpected, but breakfast isn't usually a meal I like to splurge on.  You can order a la carte, but be aware that juice and coffee (which are included with the buffet) are ~$4 EACH.  Breakfast entrees are in the $8-13 range so maybe you DO just want to get the buffet...   I did really like the wine/cheese/chocolate bar located off the lobby.  It was pricey, but very enjoyable.   We hotwire-d the room and I think total (with taxes and everything) it was about $125/night (and actually the next to cheapest hotel we found in the Loop area).  This is a place I would stay again if the price was right, but other than that, I didn't find anything fantastic about it.;3;2;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1136;8/9/2009;bdQbWLUpUNMcaf9hLVTNyg;ZGtd17RpB84r2Hka00s01w;I stayed here for 3 nights this summer. First off, the hotel from the exterior is very impressive and the hotel is in a prime location right on Michigan Ave in walking distance to shopping and across the street from major bus lines.  Close to major sightseeing spots.  Overall, a prime location. According to a friend who came here for work, the meeting rooms are very fancy.  Except I wasn't here to use anything but the rooms and lobby. Apples to apples, for their 4+ star hotel rating it was an okay experience.  I was bumped to a suite which hey, I'm not gonna complain about!   Except a few things I found oddly sub-par - the picture quality and sound of the flat screen TV were very poor and the channel line up was very limited.  It was the shabbiest TV reception I've ever encountered at a hotel.  Even my 1 star hotel experience in Spain had better TV reception.  Each day I ended getting charged incorrectly by housekeeping for allegedly taking things out of the snack bar (which I did not).  The Ipod dock for my alarm clock did not work.  The Business Center which is contracted out to a third party, messed up my printing job and double charged me. Otherwise, the hotel is very impressive from the outside and opens up to a spacious and busy lobby when you walk in.  The decor is a little bland and old-fashioned but otherwise everything about my room comfortable and what you'd expect.   Some of the employees are polite and helpful, but not to any greater extent than what you'd encounter at Days Inn.  And some employees were brusque and not as helpful.  Overall, I thought the customer service was just meh. I would say this hotel was solid but I was not impressed.  I realized after my stay here that I am perfectly happy with a recently renovated room at 2 or 3 star non-boutique hotel with a younger, more modern decor.  Because that's usually where I stay as a budget savvy traveller.;3;1;1;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1137;12/1/2009;Iydm0cY-Qcel516mqj3GDQ;hHDltEEGlvuhRjDvfbYpqg;Like others have said, this hotel has a great location and a great pool.  Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with the room itself. I came here on a family trip, where the parents got a single room with a king-sized bed, and my sister and I shared a room with two queen-sized beds.  Despite the fact that the two rooms were the same price, there was a huge disparity in the quality.  The single room was much, much nicer, from the view to the coffeemaker to the furniture.  The double room was not much nicer than what I would expect from a Holiday Inn.   I agree with the previous reviewer that the placement of the mirror was bizarre to the point of distraction.  It was on the wall right next to one of the beds.  Personally, I tend to make good use of hotel mirrors when getting ready in the morning, and it's usually near a desk or something.  This particular mirror was completely useless and only served to try and make the room look bigger.  I noted that the mirror was in a more logical spot in the single room. I think my main problem with my room was that they had the kind of toilets you have in public restrooms, with the metal handle that comes up rather than a toilet tank with a flush handle on the side.  It just felt cheap, and it was leaky, so we had to grab it with a towel to avoid getting sprayed with toilet water every time we flushed.  It just wasn't what I expected from the Intercontinental.  Also, I found it really annoying that you have to scan your room card just to open the minibar.  We wanted to keep our bottled water in there, but we were afraid of getting charged, so we just drank it at room temperature. On the plus side, all the staff were really nice.  As mentioned above, the pool is fantastic.  I went once in the evening and again in the morning, and I had to share a lane both times, but it wasn't overly crowded.  It would have been useful to know beforehand that the pool is free for guests, but the gym costs $12.   Overall, I'm happy with the hotel considering that it was only $106 a night on Hotwire, but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to pay full price for it.;3;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1138;6/9/2009;me2Hu5uxY;Q1E3bkn8odFZhnfkGMBSDQ;Stayed here for my first anniversary and loved it. You really can't beat the location. As other folks have noted, the Intercontinental is really TWO buildings - the historic tower, and the addition, or "new tower" (I'm using the term "new" loosely), which is just to the north. The main hotel entrance is in the new tower, and that's where you'll check in, visit the concierge, etc. We had a corner room in the new tower, and it was great. Not large, by any means, but clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated (one window also opened!). Everyone from the bellhop to the check-in counter staff were professional, helpful, and friendly. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was flaky, but not a big deal. That said, the real allure of the Intercontinental is the historic tower. It has charm and history in spades. The first several floors are simply amazing. Each floor is decorated and painted in a medieval or renaissance manner which is astounding in detail. There are several small fountains, murals, nooks and crannies to explore. It's an entirely different experience from the new tower, and I feel sorry for the folks who stay at the hotel and never see the original building. We didn't stop at the hotel bar, but we did check out Eno, which is the wine, cheese and chocolate bar on the ground floor of the historic tower. The place is pricey, but fun if you're feeling indulgent. There are separate reviews of Eno on Yelp as well. The only other drawback was the expensive parking, which was over fifty a night. Keep in mind that parking costs are not included if you're booking the hotel thru a third party travel website.;4;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1139;9/3/2008;ReRjpwfvqgECaY6aflqKFQ;_FQQMzEkXNUWCWIqazVKiQ;I booked a room in this hotel for my friend and myself for the night before her wedding. My idea was to get a great night's sleep and be able to get ready for her wedding day in a beautiful setting. The Intercontinental lived up to all of my hopes. The Intercontinental takes classic hotel charm to a whole new level. The lobby is magnificent and the entire experience makes it worth every dollar spent to stay there. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the bathrooms are huge! A definite benefit when getting ready for a wedding. 2 things I really loved about this hotel: When our mini-bar fridge started wheezing and whining at 12AM, they sent a repairman up immediately to fix it. Instead of fixing it in the room and keeping us up for the 45 minutes it would take, he actually brought a whole new fridge and switched the broken one out in less than 10 minutes. Sleep lost: none! Second, there's a Starbucks in the lobby. As any Starbucks addict will tell you, being able to get your morning coffee in your pajamas is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Location is great if you're an out-of-towner, rooms are comfortable, service is excellent, and the decor is beautiful. If you can afford it and are looking for more of a classic hotel vs. a modern boutique hotel, definitely stay here on your next trip to the city.;5;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1140;2/26/2011;bHpFDDk10ViDWIR-1RF1aA;BuC9XytuFDp2HUYLGqBisw;Recently stayed here for 10 days for a meeting.  I have to say the hotel was good, but not fantastic. I was in the historic tower which was nice, but unfortunately they only had 2 elevators to my floor, which made the wait quite bad some days.  The room itself was roomy and clean with a nice bed and tv/entertainment center.  Things were always clean. They charged for internet which was a pain since I was there for so long.  Also, the gym had a $18 one time fee which got you access to the pool (see other reviews...it is historic and nice) and a decent workout room. The service was good but I did not ask too much of them since I used yelp for most of my dining. THe location was great (right on the mag mile) and although not great for food would make this a great place in the spring/summer (too bad I was there in Jan);3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1141;6/16/2009;y;KvLwllMNt7dvXqBaxnJ_PA;Stayed here during the MEG convention and i was not disappointed. They upgraded me to a suite and it was gorgeous - 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, huge bathroom. I had my own little living room. They always had an elevator ready to go. It was in a great location in the city. You can walk to all the stores and there were a ton of restaurants within walking distance. Expensive, but if you can afford it, stay there.;4;1;1;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1142;3/28/2011;FK93o9TOn49rLGhmzrk5jA;TjrijFxrfXIMAD2eudvJwA;I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago over the years and this has been a favorite. Being the only hotel with a front entrance right onto the Magnificent Mile it is great to wake up in the morning and grab a cup of coffee from the Starbucks downstairs and walk right out onto The Mile. Location aside the lobby and rooms were modern and well appointed. I had a great view of Michigan Avenue from my room. Being busy I had not the chance to take advantage of the pool but I'm sure I will on my next visit which will actually be in two days. I can't stress enough how much location really matters in Chicago and this is in the perfect place. The staff was friendly and helpful, the valet service was on point but a little pricey...but on the same note it is downtown Chicago. I am staying again so that should tell you all you need to know.;4;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1143;10/25/2009;3t6VzUDBYU95veaz8GhykQ;a9GyFHluLqSAxrUiy5bCSw;The hotel has an amazing location, right on the Magnificent Mile and within walking distance to lots of shopping, restaurants, bars, and entertainment.  However, I was expecting something a little more.  Our room wasn't ready when my colleague showed up at 9pm.  They did give us coupons for drinks at the bar and for breakfast but really? The room wasn't ready at 9pm?  The remote control didn't work, one of the bedside lights didn't work and there wasn't a lot of lighting to begin with.  I suspect that the rooms in the older hotel tower are much larger and nicer.     The hotel bar was great for drinks and for people-watching.  If you do have breakfast at Zest, order off the menu and avoid the $27 breakfast buffet, it's not worth it.  Other than that, the hotel is stunning to look at and it has about the fastest elevator that I have ever been in.  However, I think if I am ever in Chicago again I will try staying somewhere else.;3;1;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1144;4/19/2009;B4U0LKJVBB8RZMH82iwNFA;0YEz07QOi5speOJjCJlxfg;Usually I am an easy going dude, but I have to vent about this hotel because I still have gripes about it days after checking out. 1.  The rooms have decor for OLD people.  I always joke about this hotel chain and say its great for old people. 2.  The beds were the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on, period.  LIke sleeping on the floor seemed like a better option at one point when I tossed and turned. 3.  The internet was not good.  I need a stable connection to do my work, and the wireless only option kind of sucked.;2;0;0;1;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1145;12/15/2010;BjoXieoAqBbxc6Hi1nDhqQ;Li1HVGOQVAre8YgiTLra6w;Stayed in the Historic Tower which has a beautifully ornate restaurant and swimming pool. The rooms are vey dark and not to my taste but the room service was responsive. Plentiful buffet breakfast ($27) and the hotel lobby has a Starbucks. The hotel is very conveniently located on Michigan Ave. 15 min walk to Macy's downtown or 15 min walk to Water Tower Place. Plenty of restaurants and bars within a 5-10 min walk.;3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1147;8/6/2008;Sj92TaEYwSFWUPPv1txsVQ;vFrFmFYq2UkTwCMWO7c7QA;I would never pay full price for this hotel, but Hotwire got us a last minute deal for Lollapalooza, when hotels were tough to come by, so it was great for the price. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable for 2, the flat panel TV was large (32" or bigger), and everything else seemed to be up to par with a nice hotel. The location is the one thing it really has going for it. Right on Michigan Avenue, a few blocks from the river, you'll get to pretty much everything from here on foot if you want to. But then there's the downsides. The "high-speed internet access" was a $13 per day wireless setup. When a hotel costs $350 per night for a room (full price, not what I paid), I'd expect that the internet access be reasonably priced if not free. $13 is ridiculous. And it wasn't all that "high-speed" either. On top of that, everything in the room had a price. Want a bottled water? That'll be $6.95 please. Forgot your toothbrush? Only $3 for this generic brush-on-a-stick. Grab a Coke out of the "Refreshment Center?" For $3.75, no problem! The drapes definitely didn't keep the light out as well as I'd hope, just as someone else mentioned. The towels were average, there was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror was always fogged up, and the remote for the TV was near useless. A few people mentioned that the water in the shower/sink would constantly change temperature, and I noticed the same thing in my room (I just love having my warm shower turn into a scalding hot shower). I wouldn't stay here again unless Hotwire assigned it to me.;3;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1148;6/29/2011;nh1kkA2J-JOSE71nDiyiVQ;uIIRFmNnTcw_DNXC9HL5Gw;In short... decent room.... terrible service. I was in Chicago last week on business and my company put me up here. I wont say it was terrible but I have experienced better. It is a good thing I didn't have to pay for the stay or I would have been really mad. I had a standard room, it was clean and nicely decorated. In another review I saw someone complain about a chair with stuffing spilling out. I don't know if I was in the same room, but I also had a chair with stuffing hanging out. However, the leather that the chair was covered with was amazing, I only sat in that chair. I don't blame them for not getting rid of it and I don't think that it could be repaired. The internet is outrageously overpriced 14.95 per 24 hours. I was in desperate need of internet so I bit the bullet and signed on (I am responsible for incidentals). They had to take my card for incidentals and said they would put a $50 hold on my account. The second day I was there they had put additional holds on my account. I went to talk to the front desk about it. I am a veteran of the Restaurant industry and I know that treating people badly never gets you what you want, so even when complaining I am always calm, polite, and patient. In discussing the issue with the front desk they were polite and attentive but ultimately treated me like I was stupid. Kept saying there was nothing they could do about canceling the hold, I would have to call my bank. In the end I realize that the issue resulted from my not being informed. At check in I signed a form, I asked to see a copy of that form, it clearly explained there would be a $125 hold placed for each day that I stayed. A little excessive if you ask me. But why couldn't the front desk just explain to me that that was hotel policy? I would have understood. Instead they acted like they had no idea, and claimed there was nothing they could do. I was there for two nights, and did not want to pay $30 for internet access, so I only signed on the one day. At check out I made it a point to mention that the only incidentals would be the one day of internet, and confirmed that the holds would be credited back to me less one day on internet. Then the front desk tells me the internet was complementary! WTF it would have been nice to know that when I checked in!!!!!!!! I don't know if breakfast came with the room, because I didn't ask and they certainly don't volunteer helpful information.;2;1;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1151;6/26/2012;mKpwUd2pRJGln7rtmwL1Nw;VeFVPU3snEPmD-iPQRzMaA;Love the pool at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Avenue.  The pool is back in business after being shut down by the city of Chicago for a few months (like many other pools in the city).  Well, now the most famous pool in Chicago is back and so refreshing...not small kid friendly so bring water wings, floaties, etc for the small kids.  Health club staff, Robert and Tereza, are exceptional.  Always friendly and courteous....a great asset to the hotel.  Locker rooms are clean and have dry saunas in both the men's and women's sides.  Always good for a sweat!  Would be great if they could remove the massage room in the men's locker room and replace it with a steam room.  It's too noisy in the locker room to have the massage room next to the showers.  Ask to have your massage in the more private space.  Also, the health club is getting all new flooring and new equipment this week.  Can't wait to try out the new state of the art equipment.;4;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1154;6/10/2010;bHy8R3;TgDNtUDKLPLEiyL0xQBPSw;My company hosted a 3-day seminar here so I had a room in the newer wing of the hotel for 4 nights on my boss's dime. The three stars represent my persepective as a paying customer, not as someone with an expense account (I would give them four stars from that perspective). First of all, the staff here are fabulous. My room was spotless every night when I returned to it. The banquet staff who catered our seminar were cheerful and seemed to honestly care that we were getting good service. Food was kept hot and replenished regularly, and the service was seemless. In that respect we were well taken care of. The service itself was definitely 5 stars. I do feel, for this caliber of hotel, that the management nickles and dimes its customers, however. My room was almost three hundred a night, and along with that cost, I had to pay $17.99 for wi-fi access, a bottle of Evian in my room was priced at $7, a 375ml bottle of Clos de Bois in the mini bar was priced at $24 (come on man! this stuff is just two steps up from jug wine), and they wanted $5 for a toothbrush, which most hotels give away for free as a courtesy to harried travelers who forgot theirs. We didn't bring enough power strips for the seminar and was charged $25 per day to use one of thiers. Had I the time, I would have just run to Office Depot to buy one instead of spending $100 of my company's money that could have gone into my bonus check. Lame. The location is very convenient, with lots of stores and restaurants nearby, but the area is a bit to hoity toity for my tastes over the span of 4 days. Michigan Ave. was off the hook last night with the Blackhawks Stanley Cup win - every sports bar in the area was spilling Chi-towners into the streets to hoot and holler about it. Just know you will be in the thick of things here. Also know that the hotel bar is quite popular. I actually could not get a seat at the bar one night, it was so crowded, but I ended up taking a cab to a less-toney part of town to drink anyway and be with my "people." Worth staying here if you aren't footing the bill for sure. Maybe a bit much if you are.;3;2;2;2;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

We didn't check out the restaurant/bars in the hotel, but they looked pretty interesting to try at another time. Our room was nice, and we had a decent view of Michigan Ave. Is it weird to comment that the bathroom in our room was well lit?

Hotel is crowded with foreigners primarily Europeans. The hotel is nice but not consistent with the price. Our room temperature control was broken and had to have engineering fix it. We spent one very cold night. They charge $18/day for Internet access and wait until you hear this... $12 to use the treadmill at the fitness center. This rule must go since it is just ridiculous.

LOUDLY. As in, 2 of the 3 nights were miserable because there was no sleeping to be had.  Yes, we should have asked the front desk, but the first night I had no idea it wouldn't turn off, the second night I was so exhausted that I just passed out, and the third night we asked the room service guy who said he could call engineering after unsuccessfully trying to turn that damn fan off.  Sigh.  But the room was clean, the bathroom was nice, and everyone we dealt with were super helpful.  One weird thing: They have a little basket of snacks atop the minibar for sale, and mixed in with that, is an "Intimacy Kit." I don't know why, but I was a little creeped out by condoms/lube sitting in between snickers and doritos.;3;0;0;2;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1176;2/10/2011;RgivyslaKzgrjo94sxRUUQ;puYvTVdrRdub0am7VxdEyQ;Not impressed at all!  I have stayed lots of hotels in the city and would NOT return to this one.  Customer service was horrible.  People could barely be bothered to help you...from the front desk to the bar staff.  It was pathetic.  While the historic tower was nice, be careful as they are currently doing renovation, and they begin working very early in the morning, everyday of the week.  Not at all impressed;1;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg
1177;3/23/2010;i8QDcmlXF3LG3B0HaFQHrA;wum1tsDWhohOBPmXEeBu2w;This was barely a three star. The only redeeming quality was the comfy bed. I got the historic tower aka old. It was terrible. I couldn't even look out the window because it was a little square window over my head. It was more like a prison window. You also have to pay for the gym which is cool but they should tell you ahead if time so you don't need to go up and down the elevator to gain access. Very disappointed.;1;0;0;0;SrNUBeLzCCBdwdUF9qepqg

1180;6/12/2012;ovyeWEvxDSBPfQ;ybpl4PtLKvx8mBF5aNfiWg;I stayed at this hotel for a conference the week of June 4. The conference facilities are nice, and what one would expect from a hotel located in a downtown district. The rooms were clean, and updated with a contemporary look. The lobby is large and open. The pros: -location -staff is very helpful and friendly -lobby bar is lively and serves decent drinks The cons: -the wifi access throughout the facility is spotty and extremely cumbersome. Being there for a conference, I was also working. I needed reliable access for the multiple devices I travel with. One can login as a guest in one's room, but when one tries to login on the conference levels, the same network is either unavailable or unusable. Same is true when trying to access via the lobby -- there is a separate network, apparently, for each of these areas. My iPhone was virtually unusable via wifi outside of my room, same for my iPad. The 3G access is awful as well. Text messages between myself and a colleague (also staying at the same hotel) were spotty -- either not arriving at all or taking several minutes to arrive. If you're considering staying here as a business traveler, I would recommend one of the many other options in the immediate vicinity. Obviously, based on the above, I place a premium on broadband internet access which has colored this review. Fast, reliable access is a must for me and the hotel fell woefully short in this regard. That said, it was a perfectly acceptable experience outside of the wifi issues, and based on the moderate price, might be a good choice for those looking for a room in the heart of the magnificent mile. There is extremely easy walking access to multiple great restaurants, and the art institute is just a nice stroll down Michigan Ave away.;2;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

It's the perfect location right on Michigan Avenue (NR Wacker) where all the shops start and right next to Nordstrom also walkable to the Merchandise Mart. The rooms are small, but comfortable for one person on a business trip for a couple of nights. Very comfortable beds and bedding. The customer service I found to be good. The AC was leaking in the floor outside the bathroom in my room and the carpet was wet. The maintenance guy was up within 10 minutes with the bell boy with rugs and asking if I wanted to switch rooms.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

We were checked into a dirty as well as awful smelling room. Then we called to get a new room and it took them almost an hour to find us one and kept telling us to wait in a room that smelled so bad I was getting a headache. Then they only activated out keys for one night so we we went all the way up to our room the second day for the key to not work. We took it down and the manager was extremely rude!!!! The only thing he could say was and I quote "I hope it gets better for you." Everyone here is rude but the manager was by far the worst. we would never stay here again and we would never recommend it. The rooms weren't even that great. Next time we are in Chicago we will definitely be staying at the JW Marriott.  This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.;1;2;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

I spent thanksgiving here, and it was just a ok. I was a little turned off being able to hear other guests peeing in their bathroom, the concierge loung was closed for 2 days which REALLY bummed me out, we usually hang out there in the evenings, and play games....but nope not this time, I love the location, but standards weren't up to par. Why is there no free WI-FI???? only downstairs ?? Not cool Over all the stay was so so, I'd like a little better stay for the money we spent to sleep here.;3;1;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1185;3/20/2011;AQrMJRu2tlKX206ix6MsEQ;pGwnjWk8R0aHH8S3xVncog;I spent a week at the Marriott recently for a conference, staying, eating, and drinking here for 5 days. There is a lot about the hotel that is good -- even wonderful. But there are also some downsides. The front desk, concierge, and bell staff are phenomenal. They are friendly, attentive, and move the seemingly endless lines very quickly. They are that same combination of assertive and nice that characterizes most Chicagoans, and they remind me why I fell in love with Chicago in the first place so long ago. The maid staff falls into this category as well, when you run into them, and everyone of these people deserve a hefty tip and a round of applause. The lobby showcases Rush bar, a rushed place that is constantly packed with patrons and guests of the hotel, and the staff flurries about as quickly as possible, slinging overpriced drinks while holding a terse smile and their breath. I can't blame them for their stress, but they need a few extra helpers on hand. The rooms are basic but nice. No flat screens or iPod docks to be found, but the beds are comfortable, and the blankets are plentiful. I asked to be on an upper floor and was given a room on the 39th, with a lake view, which was lovely. However, the windows either don't seal well or are too thin, because it seems there is no sound dampening at all between you and the Magnificently loud Mile at your feet. The detractions I have for the hotel are more on the conference side. The food, while pricey, is supremely bland. I had salmon one night, chicken the next, and a vegetarian dish the following, and they all tasted exactly the same. I found this disturbing, to say the least. In addition, the conference rooms are freezing. When you are sitting on your duff for 8 to 9 hours a day, your circulation needs a bit of help from the temp gauges, and these rooms do not afford it. Bring a coat. Better yet, bring a sleeping bag. I would stay here again, but I would not plan another event here. I recommend it for a pleasure trip to the city. The location can't be beat, and the surrounding shops, restaurants, and walkable places are worth every dime.;3;4;4;4;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1186;3/4/2011;sOqyH;D7R935yDAGHVXBj9wkG31g;This review is specifically for the fifth floor banquet hall.. If you know you will be attending a meeting or symposium here, I highly suggest you swing by Starbucks beforehand to get your favorite drink in a Venti cup and a big yummy pastry to get you through the morning, because I'm sorry, Marriott - dry apple strudels and a choice between house blend or decaf is not my idea of a quality breakfast. When you're competing with places like the Union League Club, which serves three-course meals to its conference attendees, that's just embarrassing. Also, bring a sweater - the banquet hall is cold!;2;2;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1187;6/15/2011;ykkVfsqM0c8SgkmI2btNjw;T9AtZPYC4W81rylyvOOmQQ;I stayed at the Chicago Marriott Downtown on the Mag Mile during a recent business trip to the Chicago area.  The lobby area of the hotel is very nice and a wonderful mix of modern and classy.  The bar is pretty nice and for a hotel restaurant, the restaurant within the hotel was pretty good.  Plus, there is a Starbucks in the lobby. Additionally, the location almost cannot be beat.  It's on Michigan Avenue in the heart of almost everything.  You have a great view of the city, you can walk just about everywhere, and it is possible to have a lake view as well. The rooms are an average size, but the bathrooms are tiny.  And by tiny, I mean European tiny.  Look I'm a guy and I don't really need a lot from a bathroom, but when I can barely stand in the bathroom and close the door... then the bathroom is way too small.  Plus, the shower was super weak in water pressure output. The sheets and bed were comfortable and a nice size.  i'm only 5'9", so I don't need a king bed... and probably couldn't tell you whether I was in a king bed or queen.  They're both more than enough bed for me. Overall, I had a nice stay.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1188;5/13/2011;YPlnPOVbiF1ozItmchJffw;gFugBMLclUQlXvDGt9MMQQ;Spent a week here for a work conference and extended for a girls' trip for a couple days.  Very convenient location. Shops, bars, restaurants are all within walking distance.  Taxis came quickly.  Service was friendly and helpful.   The rooms were decent:bathroooms were a little smaller than I would have liked (hey, I was sharing with another woman!).   The fact that they had a real, full-on Starbucks in the lobby was a HUGE plus.  To me, nothing is worse than having to attend day after day of a grueling national sales meeting with bad coffee.  Every day started off right here!!!  A bar being in the center of the lobby meant you were never far away from a cocktail the second work was done, either.   I haven't stayed anywhere else in downtown Chicago so I don't have much to compare it to in the city but it was a great location at a decent price for a big city.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1190;9/6/2011;cVyhdlDf1ZEr0IWVdz3BHw;4AmJVzTDA5gBFrZZDHmLlg;I should say that I type this on behalf of me and only me in case anyone knows me or figures out my organization :-) My experience with the Marriott was absolutely exceptional in terms of event planning. I work for a nonprofit organization that chose to move its fundraising gala to the Marriott from another Chicago hotel. Being a new venue, and ne to the organization and planning this particular event the combination of Amy (Sales Manager) and Christina (Event planner - I don't think that's her exact title) made everything easy and seemless. They were wondreful to work with and the night-of, Christina practically bent over backwards to go the extra mile for us, that's for sure! I really can't say enough nice things- from the tasting to the planning to settling the bill, everything went very smoothly. I woudl say if you're planning an event (conference, dinner, wedding, etc.) this is a good bet. The location is perfect for those who work/live downtown and for those visiting. It's pretty much in the heart of everything. The recent rennovation has made the hotel very colorful and modern, yet still very tasteful. The ballrooms can be modern, elegant, whatever you want them to be. The dinner was amazing and if you get a chance, be sure to include the desserts all made by hand. They are absolutely to die for! Best pastry chef ever! Apparently, everything is made in the hotel and is locally sourced as much as possible. The hotel even has its own butcher shop. I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to sound like an ad. If it balances out the review a little, I will say that the rooms were nice, but not exceptional. You had everything that you needed including a nice big bathroom, but otherwise, I would say they were pretty average. Great views, though. Ok, now I'm done.;5;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1191;4/8/2011;0LivoBIu4ecoGcve0rgRAA;xmmwTACZrEheRzZXFnyvdw;Location, location, location! My cousin and I recently stayed here for 3 nights on a weekend getaway trip. Because of the popular location we didn't need to rent a car. It was adjacent to The Shops at North Bridge, public transportation (bus/subway), taxi stands, restaurants, and pretty much anything you could possibly need. The lobby was always full of people since there is a bar and a Starbucks. After the first two nights we switched from a fairly small, yet comfortable and clean room to a bigger hospitality suite. It was basically a standard room with an adjacent living room (bonus Murphy bed we didn't use), a small kitchenette and two flat screens. Both of our rooms had spectacular views of the lake from the 44th floor. Being the needy gals we are, Concierge, the Elite desk and the front desk staff always took fantastic care of us, providing disposable razors, extra rooms keys, shuttle to O'Hare, etc. And the turn down service was a nice perk. Thanks for the chocolates.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1192;6/24/2011;pd9NOudCyhcElzQY6EC2Nw;mlELx_4TXz73UiNOuz6ATw;We stay here every year in May for the NRA show. (National restaurant Association) Great location, right downtown. The lobby is huge - lots of activity with people socializing, etc. The rooms are a bit small, but not bothersome. Work out room is good as well. The bar has great appetizers and drinks. And the staff is all very helpful. The Federal Express office could of been better. We had a package we were waiting for, we walked down to see if it had arrived. nope. We tried a few times, nothing. Finally we said we need to put a trace, they said they would. They didn't. So we did. We went back down to the office - a regional fed ex guy was there, heard our story and started to help us. It got delivered to another hotel next door. So he walked over there with us. All is good. we got our package. But then we got a call at 3:00 AM, from fed. express saying they were still looking for our package. So apparently after he left us - he didn't finish up with his own company and let them know we found it. (Maybe more training is needed - all the way up the ladder.) But they are apart from the Marriott - so for this review. We will stay again in this Marriott, just as we have been for the last 10 years.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Thanks to JetBlue delaying our flight from 8PM to 3AM, we finally arrived at our hotel by 6AM.  Although we had reservations, we were told we were lucky that 2 rooms were still available due to the Air & Water Show that weekend. Minutes later, we walk into our room...  Seriously?  No, really?? Yes, I'm tired...  Is this dream?  C'mon now! Our entire Marriott Downtown Chicago, Magnificent Mile room, including bathroom & closet, could have fit in the master bathroom of our J.W. Marriott Summerlin room in Las Vegas!  See review & photos: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…  In fact, our bathroom in Chicago is smaller than most of the bathrooms I've seen in Manhattan!  The door cannot swing open more than 45 degrees because the bathtub gets in the way! *Split second flashback to my hotel in Japan* Well, the view has got to be good, right? The window spans the width of the room & measure approximately 5'5" in height.  The view isn't breathtaking & it certainly helps that we're more than 20 stories up.  The glass only slides open about 2". You guessed it.  We're paying for location -- Step one foot out of the hotel's revolving doors & you're on Magnificent Mile. Yay: Spacious, tasteful lobby.  Nice curtains & sleek lamps. Nay: Tacky hallway carpeting.  No fridge, mini-bar snacks or safe. The lone, liter bottle of Evian in the room will cost you $5. 24 hours of internet will run you $14.95 The outdoor roof area is under construction until October 2007. We decided to extend our stay in Chicago past the weekend, BUT I could not tolerate the lack of space another minute!  We moved to the Sofitel nearby, but only after I inspected our room first.;2;20;6;9;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

I love your 300 thread count Signature linens that gave me a restful and comfy sleep. And your towels that didn't smell funky. I love your adoption of Mayor Daley's green initiative by housing 200,000 honey bees on your rooftop to produce honey for the hotel and sell to hotel guests. I love your registration clerk Melissa who gave us a fabulous room on the 39th floor that provided an amazing view of the lake. I love your house made potato chips cooked fresh daily. I REALLY love your homemade pickles that have a banana pepper zip to them. I love your close proximity to everything Chicago! No rental of a car needed. We walked everywhere. Front entrance is on Rush. Back entrance is smack dab on Michigan Avenue. Close to the river. Within walking distance to Navy Pier and Millennium Park. I love your lobby bar and the loungey, comfy furniture where we would partake of a nightcap after a day of sightseeing before we hit the hay. Yea, internet is extra and the rooms lack fridges, but you know what? This is a big city. They want you out and about enjoying the sights and sounds:not holed up in your room being a hermit. That's why I love the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile!;4;4;4;1;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1196;2/19/2008;NMy7AKS6tg1LapJJzpUG3Q;BTFWoaw8w7ABMhoWYkCpqA;This hotel is perhaps the best place to stay for your value. Let me emphasize that I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my time working in Chicago. I've stayed at: Conrad Hotel on Monroe Westin on Michigan Ave Westin on River North Residence Inn on Michigan Courtyard on Grand Palmer House on Monroe This place is still on Michigan Ave, but more like in the middle. It's got Ethel's Chocolate Lounge as a neighbor. You can get to any restaurant you want from this location. I stayed for a full 6 weeks and my room was always clean and neat when I arrived and cleaned well when I returned, and I'm a slob in hotels. When I had a complaint about charges to my room they were promptly taken off without a lot of hassle. Kudos to this hotel. This is where I wish I had stayed all the time.;5;3;0;2;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1197;4/11/2008;UqaQyby;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;There is one word to describe this hotel.  Functional, at best.   As a business traveler who stays at Marriot's all over the world- this hotel is just okay in my book.  Now granted- they are in the process of remodeling and they will have another chance to impress me when I stay here again in July, but for now?  Functional is the best I can say. From the time you pull up to the entrance- and you wait and wait and wait for the valet to come and get your car- to the mess in the lobby from the remodeling (bang, bang, bang!) to the front desk staff who acted like they were bothered that I was there, this place needs a major overhaul. The guest rooms are small and the one I was in had not yet been remodeled so it felt tired and old.  Room service for simple items took forever and no one ever did show up with the extra blanket that I requested. I also attended a banquet here and although the space was large and remodeled, there are certainly better banquet facilities in this city.  The banquet food was cold and tasteless and we couldn't get a refill of our water or wine glasses throughout the entire evening.  When we asked for additional rolls because there were not enough for everyone at our table- the server told us that it was "planned that way".  What?  They planned to have 5 rolls for a table of 8? On the positive side- this hotel is in a great location at Rush and Ohio close to all that a tourist may want to do in our fine city.   But as for me?  I think I'll let them finish their remodeling and give it another shot this summer to see if the "facelift" that they are doing goes deeper than just the surface.;3;2;2;1;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1198;12/6/2008;GKiBfsIUwzaHzPp6lEbitQ;Wg6bUKztQryePT9gmp8j0A;My brother used to stay at this location on business and he recommended it to me and although you pay a little extra for the area, its still an okay price. The bar is very well stocked, the service was friendly and quick to serve and the seats were very comfortable. But since its in a big open space and near the side entrance it can get chilly sat there if the heat isn't cranked up at night. I wish the Starbucks was open a little later, but with so many others surrounding the hotel, its a minor complaint. I was a fan of the restaurant- both breakfast and dinner was delicious but its was rather overpriced. The gym was perfect both in stock, cleanliness and smell. The wi-fi 'deals' apparently improved vastly since the refurb so that no longer effects my rating. And of course the room itself, was...well standard Marriott. Big comfy bed with plenty of extra pillows and blankets and the bathroom had a pretty decent shower. It was among the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in and the friendliest. Will definitely recommend this location to my mother (and shes even pickier than me!) if she visits me late next year.;4;2;2;1;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1199;7/30/2007;sX;Yej5B4nd8PqpHMQcmCTDrg;I was impressed with the Chicago Marriott Downtown on several counts. * Perfect location * Amazing concierge service * Comfortable beds * Extensive health club equipment * Kick-ass lobby The location simply can't be beat.  Halfway between Water Tower and the Loop on Michigan Avenue means that the hotel is suited for business travelers, shoppers and tourists.  And since it's adjacent to Grand you're a few blocks away from the Red Line and along the free trolley route to Navy Pier.   Again, the location is simply unbeatable.   The concierge service was awesome.  They went above and beyond with helpful tips for sightseeing, restaurant recommendations/reservations, and even brought up a phone charger to my room for my use. The beds and down comforters were quite the highlight.  I overslept a few times, and like to think this was the reason. While the pool and hot tub were standard and ordinary, I was surprised to find how awesome the health club was.  I expected to find three treadmills, two barbells and a situp contraption.   To my delight I found a cardio room of 20 machines, and a completely separate free weight area with about 40 machines, barbells and dumbbells -- in a hotel??  That's almost as good as any nearby gym. And, yes, the lobby is busy, well appointed and not too stuffy.  Tons,of plush furniture flanked by a bar, Starbucks, and the busy din of travelers milling about. While there are better hotels in the area (Park Hyatt, Peninsula, Drake, etc.), we all can't afford that - so this is a good compromise.  All in all, it was a postive experience in a recommended hotel.  I would stay here again. My only complaints would be the general noise and loudness of the area, the hotel's lack of WiFi and the cramped hotel room bathrooms.  Even being 43 stories up, the noise of the streets below still felt a bit loud at times.  For a popular convention hotel such as this not to have free WiFi is kind of embarrassing.  The bathrooms are TINY.  I couldn't even open and shut the door without completely maneuvering around the sink and toilet.  This bathroom rivals NYC for petiteness.;4;2;2;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1201;6/1/2011;Q-WhqiD3zwGL4DgJ;Jl0VYhwpGb1lwWGIRrPmMg;We stayed here over the past weekend for a wedding.  We got a sweet discount for wedding guests, which was really the only reason we could afford to stay here.   The good: - LOCATION!  We were able to walk everywhere, which was great - Starbucks and bar in the lobby - the view! Our 39th floor room had a lakeview, and floor to ceiling windows with which to appreciate it.  It was by far the best view I have ever had in a hotel.   - Our room was comfortable (king size bed), flat-screen tv, good water pressure, no smells - the elevators are fast, which is great when you are up almost 40 stories The bad: - would have liked a mini fridge and free internet, but no one is perfect - the tv lost the cable signal for about an hour:however, there was a pretty severe thunderstorm going on (of course, that's why we wanted to watch tv and see the weather...) - parking was difficult.  We opted to do the off-site garage parking for $33/night (expensive, but what can you expect downtown?).  The first garage next to the hotel we pulled into was full, but made us pay $6 to get out. Gee, thanks.  We accidentally went by the next one, and when we tried to just do a lap around the block, we got stuck behind a parade that had shut down most of the area.  So it took us about an hour to turn around and get back to the hotel to park again.  The validation process was easy, however.  But next time we will probably just pay the extra to valet.   If we can afford it, we would definitely stay here again on another trip to Chicago.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1202;6/25/2007;u40cjt1fakeCF2gP8M1b7A;_pIG1_s6Bzymn1zeyLjBHQ;What a great hotel, located centrally in downtown Chicago, close to any place you'd want to be, all within walking distance, or a really short cabride away. This particular hotel has a lobby that is always packed with people, with a bar and seating areas in the wide open of the lobby with the registration desk tucked away.  The bellboys and concierge folks are friendly - and the the rooms are nice. Their suites were an interesting concept.   A 2 bedroom suite was actually one huge room with bar and a dining area/living area, and a single hotel room attached, sort of like a guestroom.   The views from the 43rd floor was breathtaking  - all of Chicago RIGHT THERE... WAY DOWN BELOW.  Given my fear of heights, this was not the best set up for me, with floor to ceiling windows, but it was indeed beautiful. A little inconvenient was the way their elevators work.  With 6 elevators, you'd think there would be more elevators working the 45 floors, but it always seemed to be my elevator stopping at every floor to pick more people up on the way down.  Strange.... The bathrooms are a bit small for the size of the rooms, and while they had granite countertops, that was the only noteworthy thing.  Toiletries are supplied, and there is a blowdryer if you want.  But no bathrobes or other special items you'd find at what I would consider a 5-star hotel. The bed at Hyatt McCormick was more cushy - but that said - with my back problems, the beds at  this Marriott gave me a better night's sleep and I felt great the next morning, whereas at the Hyatt's bed, I always woke up in pain.  I'm not sure why.... but the Marriott bed was SUPERB for me.  Go figure. The entire hotel is non-smoking, so that should be kept in mind if you smoke.......... Room Service is efficient and fast.  The coffee was actually quite good, served in a thermos, with two glasses of water accompanying it, and arriving within 30 minutes of ordering.  GOOD. In any case, the location can't be beat.   The hotel in itself and the rooms are nice, and the views are fantastic. If staying in Chicago, and you're wanting to be close to the nightlife, restaurants, etc - - this would be an ideal choice.   Incidentally, it is right across the street from Joe's Prime Steakhouse, which I yelped earlier. http://www.yelp.com/biz/…;4;2;0;1;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1203;5/10/2010;loxllaclbqXg-HoKrPdYYw;Zet-9TNC6Hfcdq1Zg80X-Q;Agreed. Location is great.  But there are also a lot of other hotels in the same area.  I stayed at this location for a convention being held at the venue.  If I had a choice I would have stayed elsewhere...for the following reasons: - Rooms are tiny.  They have updated the decor but doesn't make up for the closet feeling room. - Separate charge for internet service.  If some motels can provide free wifi why can't you when I pay 3x as much for a stay here? - Split elevators.  They have separate elevators for floors 1-28 and another set of elevators for the higher floors.  Confusing if it's your first day there or you switched your room several times like I did. - Broken ac/heater functions.   - Foul smell bathrooms.  Like they used a dirty cloth and no cleaning solvents to wipe down the inside of the bathrooms.  Ewwww On a positive note, the staff was wonderful and really accomodating.  If only the building and amenities reflected the cost and service - I would be a happy camper.;2;3;3;2;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1204;5/29/2008;BtSwtsXNqzMEuDEKShZ9Eg;2y4GB6HVyYTeryoF0pPLog;I am no hotel aficionado, but I had the opportunity to stay in this particular hotel for my first visit to the Windy City.   The location is awesome. Central to plenty of great restaurants, you are walking distance from shopping, and really anything else you may want or need. I even walked to the shore of the lake, it was beautiful. There is a full bar in the lobby, which seemed cool to me at the time, but I never got a great vibe from it. However, the bartender there was very kind and remembered me from the night before. Very tip-able staff. My room was beautiful, and very clean. Plenty of amenities. Kind of a small bathroom and nothing spectacular, but it got the job done. Downsides... No free wi-fi = stupid! The positive to this was that it forced me to learn how to connect via bluetooth through my cell phone... nerd central.   Like other posts have said the valets were a touch on the inattentive side, but they were all right.   One thing that really annoyed me was that most cabbies had no clue where this Marriott was located! There is another Marriott within walking distance so I think it is rather confusing... but really. That isn't the hotel's fault, but it is something worth mentioning. The ball room was great for the awards ceremony I attended, and again the staff was very accommodating. Worth a shot if you want to stay on the mile, and definitely a great place if you are on a business trip.;4;3;3;2;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1206;11/11/2008;STzmqYGS500YKH0rBqXv;Rdtp3Yam3moqnGIG3td3wA;This review speaks completely to the Marriott as a venue to host a meeting or event. I was here for a conference and I must say that I was impressed by some of the renovations. The colors look very modern, hip and trendy. The layout of the hotel can be a bit confusing but the hotel did a great job of placing signs to assist those who may have gotten off track. The food served for every meal, break, and the reception was great and well thought out. It didn't feel like the hotel food of "yesteryear" . A few negatives: the hotel didn't anticipate the need for hangers for the coat racks on a cold November day so people were tossing their coats on top of the racks while staff stood about and eventually got more hangers. Escalators were not in service and the stairwell needed to access the floor where the sessions were being held was kind of scary and dingy. Lunch serving staff seemed very unhappy, many people weren't offered drinks with their lunch or coffee. When I walked up to the hotel I was not greeted by any staff or offered any assistance though i'm sure I look baffled since I was looking for a specific entrance.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1211;9/5/2009;CpugLU5Qz3jXOOk0MWphdQ;iopodGvH8SPjjJWIe447sg;The location of the hotel is the major selling point for this hotel (which gets a plus one star) Located right on Michigan Ave which has a lot of restaurants and shopping. It also is several blocks away from the Chicago Art Institute (I walk fast so if you walk slow or don't like walking take a cab). The staff is very friendly and courteous. The views from your room on the top floors are pretty cool (request that if you are staying). The lobby has a bar right there which serve excellent strawberry mojito ($15). They have a lot of elevators but can still be an issue during peak times (7:30 AM and 5:30 PM) with it running slow or filled with people. The rooms are not as large as most standard Marriotts but that is usually expected for hotels within a city. They had water issues where they didn't have very hot water or if you are taking a shower the water would get cold then when you turn it up suddenly it's gets scalding. Despite some annoyances it's a nice stay.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

We spent a night here just to get away, and overall I was pleased. The hotel is bustling, the service is attentive and efficient, and the space is very clean despite heavy traffic. The room is very small, and we paid extra for a 'large room', but that doesn't bother me for a short stay with 2 adults. However, the room really lacked basic amenities: no mini fridge, blow dryer, silverware or glassware. Just would have been nice to know ahead of time, so I could have planned a little better. Nice space, and I would stay here again. I can't imagine having kids in the room, though - just too small for a family space!;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1215;6/29/2011;1Sp8Qads9zhiuDiKE47mNw;zre1tagzAxy7dqo6jWuHfQ;I stayed here for a convention over Memorial Day weekend. Like other reviewers mentioned, the location really cannot be beat. It's right in the middle of everything, and it was an excellent location to explore the city from. From my experience, the staff is incredibly helpful and kind. Downsides are definitely the lack of mini fridges (!) and the size of the rooms, which were a definite squeeze for me and the 3 other people I stayed with. There was almost no space for our luggage, which was a problem. What irked me most though was probably the paid internet. This place isn't cheap:if a Motel 8 has free wi-fi, why doesn't this hotel? Overall a good experience though. Would recommend.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

I would say that this is a pretty standard hotel that happens to be in the middle of Michigan. I wasn't taken back by the lobby although the lounge was neat when we stayed. It's under renovation now.

The lobby fills up with people, probably because the rooms are so average in size and quality. The revolving door along Michigan Avenue is automatic, but turns slowly so there is always the desire to push it along (not a good idea). The location of the hotel along Michigan Avenue is good, and the Kinko's on the second floor is not as busy as other locations in the city.;3;1;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1219;3/8/2008;p-hoVe4tDB1Dm91LKluJqQ;_9EIx0AMRspVvWds8PHsLw;I attended a special event here and have to say that it was pretty nice. The lobby entrance was a little chaotic and not clean because of construction, but the conceirge staff directed me where to go for my event.  The banquet and event floor is really nice and airy. The dark red and yellow carpet complements the rich wood lining the walls. The event that I attended took up all most of the ballroom.. The ballroom matches the hallway as well. In general, the facilities were nice. The lunch that they served us was pretty good I have to say. For being hotel conference food, it was good. They served chicken parm, ceasar salad, and steamed veggies. It was a tasty, light meal that was decent. For the cocktail reception, my first cocktail was pretty strong, but the second one was a little sweeter. Out of all of the food they served, the chocolate brownie was killer. It was a good mix of sweet and rich. Best hotel chocolate brownie that I've had. In general, the hotel banquet facilties were nice and clean. The food was pretty good too.;4;0;1;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A
1220;9/26/2011;xozhiwFdHSY5ztF6nlHZRw;0GNzUcrdgVkGrt0MqjMLJw;Wonderfully located to all of the Magnificent Mile shopping and dining, as well as the Rush ST entertainment district.  Easy access to Lake Shore DR or I-94 and the Loop as well.  The valet and bellhops work hard to get you in and out of your car which can be tricky since they only have one lane in their pull-in area.  Yeah, the $48 valet parking is pretty steep, and there are lots of garages nearby, but come on, this is downtown Chicago parking is a bigger bear than those guys playing down at Soldier Field, you may end up spending less with the valet if you want in and out privileges.  The lobby is gorgeous.  Contemporary without feeling cold.  Elevators (at least the high rise ones) are fast and efficient.  Every staff person I came in contact with was courteous and professional.  The rooms aren't huge, but large enough.  Comfy beds.  Shower had great water pressure (pet peeve of mine).   Here's a tip...if you want a great view high up request a feather free bedding room.  We were on the 39th floor on the Michigan AVE side which gave us gorgeous views of the Mag Mile skyline.;4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

1223;10/10/2011;nO;hP0nX9fkBZELMIPhTjv8bA;This is the first time my family has stayed at this facility. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. However, even though we booked the room weeks in advance, my wife and I were given a handicapped accessible room even though neither if us is handicapped. I commend Marriott for having these rooms available for those who require such accommodations however the room was very "user unfriendly" for both my wife and I.  The coat hooks on the back of the bathroom door made our clothes drag on the floor, the shower had no shower curtain which allowed water to splash all over the bathroom floor during my shower (my wife refused to use the shower).  The pillows on the bed were not the traditional rectangle pillows as they were square and not nearly big enough. Also, given the price we paid for the room we were amazed that Internet access was $14.95 and not included in the room price. Given the above I would not recommend this hotel and we will not be booking a reservation at this Marriott location in the future.;1;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Logic!)  Cheaper parking is available at surrounding garages for about $25 overnight.

1230;8/20/2012;mYi1mLab3crn;odoKbBFczeBligA9Dz7xyg;I would have given it four stars, but the nickel and diming just got to me. There is no reason to charge 25 bucks a night extra plus tax for an executive room and wifi and fitness equipment access when I can get free wifi at a holiday inn and use fitness equipment too.  This was just a ripoff. Don't park at the hotel.  There are several self pay places right behind the hotel.  You can pay 45 bucks a day at the hotel, or you can pay 22 bucks a day.  You choose.  And it's a short block. I prepaid for the hotel via hotwire, but they still asked for a card for incidentals and put a $300 hold on it.  They could have at least told me what they were doing when they were doing it.  I found out in checking my balances online. The room was nice, but some things unnecessary.  My room had a huge flat screen, two double beds, and two full bathrooms.  We didn't really need two full bathrooms, though it's a unique touch. Newly renovated rooms.  The metro train runs and is audible from the room.  This might really bother some people, but it didn't bother me or my son.  We sleep like rocks, and there's something about the sound of trains that I actually find kind of soothing.  We are also night owls anyway, and the train stops running after like 2 or 3, so it didn't impede our sleep. The inside of the hotel is great.  The place is is like a titanic ocean liner without the sinking.  This is a grand dame hotel with a lot of history, celebrating its 85th year this year.  I't's decorated very nicely.  Presidents and celebrities have stayed here.  The penthouse suites are something like 2700 square feet.  It's a splurge place.   I got a lower price on hotwire.  I think because it's so big (1544 rooms), they always have some rooms available and so need to go that route.  I almost booked it on http://hotels.com, was thrilled to get it for much cheaper on hotwire, though the wifi/fitness equipment charge took away some of the discount (http://hotels.com had various packages that included different things such as parking or wifi, many different head spinning combinations to confound).  Anyway, I think I still got a bargain. I'd recommend it to any first timer to Chicago, so they can have a grand experience. For subsequent visits to Chi-town, stay at a place that offers free wifi and free or more reasonable parking.  But we really enjoy the grandness of it, and were happy to be there.;3;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1231;8/8/2012;ZUoVhMdFECYN92Be63ZF3Q;kvFWIY7f_0J43_nxhUb5jA;Alright, friends.  I'm going to be as straightforward as possible.  This place is a dump.  It's just gross.  I'm tempted to leave it at this, but I feel obligated to let you know why this place is an avoid-at-all-costs establishment. The premise of my stay at the Hilton was a work trip for BF about a week ago.  His firm paid for his room, and I got to tag along (yay trip to Chi!).  I usually stay at Embassy Suites (another Hilton chain, ironically), but since one cannot argue with a free hotel stay, one goes where one is told. As I mentioned, this was a business trip, and the convention was held in the hotel, so it was packed. We walked in and pushed through the barrage of company polo shirt clad attorneys, and wives that stepped right out of a Talbots catalog, to the reservation desk.  I noticed a few people taking photos of their kids in the lobby, which is sort of a grand foyer kind of deal.  I presume most people think that this is a gorgeous area:I'll just say it's not my taste.  Were it 1984, and I was Janet Jackson on tour, I probably would have been a little more impressed.   We make our way to the reservation desk, which appears to be reminiscent of a Cedar Point queue line.  After our long and strenuous quest, we make it to the desk, where we are asked for BF's credit card, for the purpose of "holding the room," and the card was not to be charged. Keep this tidbit in your mind, folks.  Since the room was supposedly prepaid for, we were a little confused, but obliged, so as not to hold up the line any longer. (Insert "That 70s Show" transition with BF and I dancing in acid washed jeans and over-sized shirts) We return to check into our room. Whoa! Throwback. This place had obviously not been updated since the 80s. Not to mention the fact that I don't think the AC had been serviced since the 80s, since we walked into a brick wall of heat immediately after stepping off the elevator. Once we actually get into our room, I acknowledge the small amount of nostalgic charm, and since I had just rode back from Wrigleyville on the El, after many beers, I head to the bathroom. It's fair to mention I'm quite a germophobe.  I spray everything with my TSA approved bottle of Lysol, and whip out Clorox wipes.  This place was enough to make BF (the complete opposite of me) cringe. First off neither the drain in the sink, nor the tub, worked.  The toilet was a push-lever model, straight from the industrial building store. Nothing appeared to be cleaned well, as I noticed water marks everywhere. The towels were dingy and some had dirty spots.  Shudder. Like the drains, the AC didn't work either.  I had called maintenance, who was supposed to send someone up "right away," however they were a no show.  Perhaps they were attending the soiree that the housekeepers were having in the linen room down the hall.  Everyone was having a grand time... laughing, being merry, being obnoxiously loud. It reminded me of the sort of party Gatsby could pull off.   Day 2, and our maid, who, I think may have both been deaf and not an English speaker (honestly, not trying to be mean here), came to clean.  Except the fact that I was in the room. Sleeping. One would expect the housekeeper to leave a sleeping guest lie. Not so. She carried on with banging things around in the bathroom, and then discovered the drain. She apparently couldn't clean the bathroom with the malfunctioning drain, so she decided to tell us we needed to call maintenance right then. BF was trying to explain that we were napping and would call later, but she was insistent to the point that she came into the living area of our room, picked up the phone, and tried showing us what she wanted by dialing a bunch of numbers and then slamming the phone down. We politely tried to shoo her out, and she finally got the hint that we were trying to rest. Day 3, maintenance finally comes, and explains to me that the AC is not broken, but rather there is a secret trick to making it work!  Alas, my troubles are solved!  How stupid of me, I should have known that you have to press two buttons down, while turning the thermostat down, waiting for the screen to say something, and then releasing the buttons. Very user friendly.  He also fixes the drain at this point, but makes a huge mess. I called to have them clean it up, but again, nobody came. Checking out was the highlight of the trip. Until we realized that BFs card was charged for the room. They proceeded to "fix" the problem by transferring the charges to his boss's card, until two days later, and a charge is showing as an overdraft. They had not fixed anything, and we find out that not only did they charge BF's personal card, they charged the firm card, and the partner's personal card. That's quite an amount, mind you. After many phone calls and excess time spent, everything was adjusted finally. Needless to say we will not be staying here again.;1;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1232;5/5/2012;KKHJN6W0vMsH2HlyGAmD1Q;zjkH4aOQmA_5Oj7LxbHJ9g;Talk about Historic.   Just taking the elevator to my room, the tv screen is spitting out all these facts about the hotel....   Quite impressive.   I walk into my room (which has a double bed), and its the size of a small apartment.   The receptionist told me that some of the double bed rooms are twice the size of king sized beds - and although I like King beds....   This was nice.     The new renovations have added some new technology to the room - and this computer which is all "High Tech"... is annoying as hell.   First off - the internet is NOT free.   They don't tell you the price, but a small warning comes up saying very sneakily that you agree that all charges can be placed on your room....     You can clearly tell that this software is just another ad revenue for the hotel since most of the "recommended" places to visit also happen to advertise on it.... Hmmmmm  interesting.   The parking situation is stupid expensive!!  I understand you are in Chicago, and it's a freaking commodity, but $50 per night!!!    I was there for a week!!!!   Great room, nice views, friendly staff..... TOO expensive!;4;1;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1234;3/4/2012;qxAqUk4N6ty0eRILyQinKg;F5PBeIakPUj0wkR1lgkkpA;I got the opportunity to stay here for a night and was quite impressed. Everything from the touchscreen computer in the room to the lobby to the comfy bed to the staff made my stay memorable. When we first got into the room we ordered some room service (grilled chicken sandwich) which came very quickly and turned out to be delicious. The bathroom was a little bit outdated and dusty, but the shower was great and the shampoo/ conditioner products they had were amazing! The view from the hotel room was beautiful. We were in a corner room on one of the top floors looking onto the lake and down S Michigan Ave. If you can choose your room I definitely recommend this side of the building. i would stay in the Hilton again if I ever need to!;4;1;1;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Consider this a museum and just walk around and LOOK. The Grand Ball room is extraordinary. Try the Irish Pub here..............ask for Paddy.;4;2;0;2;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1236;1/17/2012;MVhpAF;wBhCC8Au-HNn2_B9Y3wmQQ;The interior in this place expired two decades ago.  Peeling paint on my bathroom ceiling.  The ice bucket is right out of 1980's as all the decor.  Charges for everything.  Internet @ $15 dollars a day.  Seriously, I get much more modern accomodations with everything included at a Red Roof Inn....  The Red Roof would even have a Fridge and microwave.  This place just has an empty cabinet where the must have one been a fridge... It is clean even if used up.  However, it is 3 times the price of equal or better accomodations around.  The TV's are at least modern...  If the convention I am attending wasn't being held here I would seek better accomodations for less money. Pathetic compared to what someone would expect fron a Hilton....;2;2;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1237;3/3/2012;HoXfEjcKed-igZIjBDchiw;m8ie5HQWIgQA1yD7FbiWAw;This hotel was great for the location - our room had a partial view of Grant Park and Lake Michigan. However, the hotel and the rooms were in dire need of a remodel when we stayed here in November 2011. it looked like there were some renovations going on in the lobby, but our room was pretty dated. Luckily we booked this place through Priceline and got a good deal, but if I were paying the regular rate for this hotel I think I would have been pretty disappointed. The hallways were kind of dimly lit here, so overall it just wasn't a very inviting hotel. One thing that I did like was that the room actually had two bathrooms, which was something I hadn't seen before. The beds were only double beds though, so I would probably rather have had bigger beds than a second bathroom. I don't think I would purposely book this place on my own, but if I got a good deal on Priceline I wouldn't object to staying here again.;2;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1238;1/9/2012;BIyJhQQdRsU4k8QJxojsOQ;dOVSurtoQNhAweQe48UI0w;I stayed here this past weekend and had a room facing the lake. It was a nice and cozy room. I had access to the Executive Room for a continental breakfast which was nice. The staff members were friendly.   I like  the location of the hotel, across from Grant Park and I enjoyed the view of the lake and the city.   I didn't get a chance to experience the in-hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them but I will the next I stay hear.;4;1;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1240;10/20/2011;-hjcaAoUCHXLazc27h--dg;Ys2hzLg7bAiG2BmX2S-Wlw;Wow, what a disappointment!  Don't want to be vulgar, but this place is a real s**t hole.  No doubt. The Hilton name implies a certain level of quality.  Yeah, but that died when Conrad Hilton passed away.  Hilton is going down rapidly and this hotel proves my point. In a city like Chicago, with all the top-shelf hotels one may choose from, this is one to avoid like the plague! The carpet in the common areas is filthy, worn and threadbare.  The chairs in the common area as the same:  dirty, worn and threadbare, and so 40 years ago.  The styles are out-of-date, the colors are sad, the paint is blistering and peeling, and overall the hotel is just depressing!  And yes, I know the historic background to this hotel and no, the 'out-of-date' motif is not my misunderstanding of the property's history.  Trust me, it's awful! The bank of elevators is stunning in its lack of thought and design.  There are ten elevators, five on each side.  As you press the ONLY elevator request button (yes, one button for all ten elevators) one notices the paint that is blistering, cracking, peeling, dirty, nicked and overall more like you'd expect to see in a horror film psychiatric hospital.  And  the detail of the ceiling's woodwork?  It's been painted so many times the relief and detail is filling in with layers upon layers of paint.  Yuk! The room itself has a nice modern flat screen television with beds that are 30 years out-of-date, bathrooms that are out-of-date and feel unclean containing soap and shampoo selections that disappoint.   The breakfast buffet in Buckingham's is another disappointing feature.  I went there three times as there was little other choice.  On Saturday I could tell the oatmeal was left over from Friday, as were the 'eggs' if you want to call them eggs.  How could I tell?  They were dry and almost had a crust on them from being in storage overnight.  NOT appetizing. The exhibit halls are dungeon-like as they are down in the bowels of the hotel. Columns block walking paths and views.  The exhibit halls become a labyrinth and, as a result, it is difficult to find much of anything.  Here for a meeting?  Good luck!  Planning a meeting here?  AVOID it. Overall, this hotel is simply as sad and depressing as it gets.  This is the type of hotel where one would expect to find the businessman (or woman) swinging from a bed sheet while hanging from the shower head in a last-ditch effort to escape this depressing property. Quick!  Run!  Run to any other hotel in the city as there  are many, many better hotels charging a similar rate.;1;0;1;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1241;10/12/2011;wFCHk9LGT-3yeoG-WCAhsA;2fN8mN7uUjOw-QqtcgYqXQ;I stayed here for 3 nights for a work conference, from Sunday to Wednesday. My room was quite nice. Large 42" plasma and welcome center terminal, although the room itself was a bit small. The gym and pool are on the 8th floor, and the first 3 floors are mostly conference rooms. This place was absolutely packed with conference attendees while I was there, since there were 3-4 other large ones. Entire hotel has 1500 rooms. Wifi is ridiculously expensive, but luckily our company covered it. Parking is also ridiculously expensive (about $50/night), so you're better off parking in one of the many garages nearby. Food during the conference was pretty good, as was service.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1242;7/28/2011;qc6icKOay3JZlluCclEfqQ;XrOtG_35xrtTYazoBk7dpg;Very elegant hotel in the South Loop of Chicago, right off the Harrison subway exit on the Red Line. Very good location, with easy access public transportation. Our room was big and clean, with a wonderful view. We actually had two views, one of Lake Michigan , the other of downtown. I would request a corner room, we stayed in room 1169 if you would like to request that room. The only downfall is you have to pay an extra fee for access to the gym. It was $15/day and when I peeked in there wasn't anything spectacular. The pool is an indoor lap pool with two jacuzzi spa but it has a nice outside area where you can lay out. The service was friendly and fast and the hotel bar is fully equipped. I would definitely recommend this hotel to visitors of Chicago who want a convenient hotel. It was walking distance from Buckingham Fountain and right across Grant Park.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1243;1/4/2012;VfdjzlT;hqp-UAn5cyLAShRacUJ68g;Stayed here last February and again this New Year's Eve eve for a friend's wedding. The reception was at Zapatista a few blocks away. The good news for us is that they allow dogs, even big dogs. For a fee of $50, we could take our 50lb+ Labradoodle (or so the rescue said) puppy with us.         I know from our last visit that the hotel gym is great, the biggest gym I have seen in any Hotel, a real gym, not just a universal machine and a couple of treadmills. It had power racks, rowers, full range of dumbbells and plates (more but my memory of a year ago is faulty).        We had the breakfast buffet in the morning. It was free and ok, but not exciting. I get excited about a good breakfast buffet. I think any calories consumed before 11am do not count.       The location of the Hotel was great for our purpose, but it is a little south of the real downtown. It is right across from the park and very close to the Grant Bark Park, which we used.       The rates were great for both stays:$80 for the first stay through Priceline and $180 for the second stay (that includes the $50 dog fee).;4;0;0;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1244;5/9/2011;E8YEvTDCYNKp0qGHQDak8Q;_iQ-APamoahuBv8qG-rxYQ;Though I've never stayed in this hotel, I've been here for a dinner event and really enjoyed myself. The food was good, the service was good, and the venue is quite elegant. Definitely take cues from other jilted guests -- carry your junk with you or lock it down. Though it may look it from the inside, you're not in Oz and your crap will get jacked if you leave it out in the open. Take a tad bit of personal responsibility and you won't find yourself trying to get the hotel to reimburse for your lapse in common sense. Seriously, I read that review and wonder if it's the same woman whose kid hit my car with a shopping cart and then gave *me* the stink eye when I asked her what gives. Also, the acoustics were good.;3;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1245;6/19/2010;eTq206C8HJx1-Ow33bpuyA;cf-J2rZQyklNDFuTEeCIMw;Location. Location. Location. This hotel sits on the ever famous Michigan Mile, and is within blocks of  the red line and other trains. It's within walking distance of Grant Park, Dunkin Donuts, restaurants, shopping, banks, museums...do I keep going?   Size. Size.Size. Be warned, this is not your mom and pop hotel. It's massive. Conventions are held here year round.  I stayed during some kind of a real estate banking gig, and I was almost swallowed by the seat of suits...not that I am complaining. Bigger is better, and in this case you can bet the farm on it. My room was spacious. 2 beds, and 2 matching bathrooms. Yup, 2 matching bathrooms! Girls need not worry about having to share sink space. The Extra's: Customer service was stellar. The housekeeping staff, the room service, the front desk, the bell hop, and even the guy opening my door and getting my cab. I was impressed. Originally, I checked into the 12th floor but was not too thrilled about the smoke smell in room.  Not sure if the past guest was smoking or the 10th floor was creeping through my vent.  I called the front desk and was moved promptly to the 17th floor. I appreciated the immediate attention to my concern.   The Filler: -1 star for $50 dollar for late check out fee to 1PM and $75 to 3PM. Yeah...wait what? I also didn't appreciate having to pay a $2 fee for each bag I stowed.  It helped, but shouldn't this service be free? Nonetheless, this hotel is historic. It's spacious. It's old school. It's friendly.  Respect the game, and enjoy the craziness. If you got the cash, stay here.;4;7;7;6;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1247;11/6/2008;r7Imkqu4M1cPXqz9lSJ9hQ;HwMZ0ld2P4V4-kSw-YxjGA;Thanks to Jenny Z. I got to stay in one of the four rooms she got from her Hilton Diamonds Reward Program and just the fact that they pulled four rooms for her the night or two before the rally makes me like them even more. The room was nice. I thought it was larger than other rooms I've been in but can't say how it compares to other Hilton locations. Also the beds were unbelievably comfortable and the bathroom was huge. They had a well stocked mini bar but the key was hidden from me and I was not allowed in. How well I guess we did have a tub of booze anyway! The hotel staff was very nice and tried to be as accommodating as possible. They were so busy but everyone was very nice and took things in stride. I arrived via cab and as soon as I got out I had four different men wanting to help me with one bag. They opened the doors and directed me to check in all with smiles on their faces and a ton of people with more luggage than I walking around everywhere. If I can expect this kind of service at every Hilton I will be a very happy girl!;5;3;3;2;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1248;2/19/2008;ghTVhtMFZEMYczGQMcUkqw;XeaO7K7faXC6XcGMCe5KmQ;Reminiscent of the gradiose hotels of the early 1900s... Beautiful high ceilings, gilt wood, lobby, pool (though it closed early), two smaller hot tubs, work out center, and room with city views. My boyfriend and I recently stayed there on valentine's day (which is a thursday, so...) for only $90 through priceline. The hotel just isn't at capacity in the winter and you can get great rates. We wandered through the spacious, empty lobby and stumbled on a grand ballroom, complete with balconies and elaborate, glass chandeliers. Great space for a wedding. Be aware... parking is almost $50 a night, truly a rip-off!! But the location can't be beat. Other downsides: most of the hotel's restaurants close in winter and Kitty O'Shea's, while open until 11 for food, was just not that good. But extremely affordable! Breakfast menu from room service was the only real disappointment, boring and veerry basic We were placed on the "Executive Floor", which I would almost certainly request if you can. They are higher floors with much better views. Little details in the service make a big difference to me. For example, I called to request tea in the morning and they brought up an enormous selection promptly, complete with creamers and to-go cups. I felt like Michael Jackson!! that's what they would give Michael Jackson. People say his star has fallen, but wouldn't you just poop yourself if he was staying in your hotel?? A note - You can buy passes to their gym/pool, not that I would ever work out in a million years. But some might. Some might. A 3-day pass to extensive facilities within walking distance to the Loop was $15, extremely reasonable. Back to the room: Warm colors, dark wood, smallish space, freshly tiled bathroom, white linens and comforter. Cable, but no DVD player. USA Today outside our door in the morning and check-out via phone from the room topped off the night. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. To hell with modern decor!;4;3;2;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1249;8/3/2009;y5QfAKgk-;UCQXjZTdPrq7FZ9eGQnkaQ;The reputation far exceeds the reality of this place. Yes, it's old, and yes, famous people have stayed here. That's about it. The rooms are NOT luxurious in any way. The cleaning people didn't even do a very good job. Our tub was always clogged and gross. And the elevators? Horrendous. You'd think with that many people staying at the hotel, they'd have fast moving elevators. No way. The best thing about the Chicago Hilton is the guy who'll call a taxi for you and open the door. That was the highlight of my stay at this hotel.;2;2;2;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1250;8/17/2010;g9OKmNp01x3IEK2WXwfWWg;ItvyYPGXWNhhbYJqyADp7A;I want to steal their pillows. I'm used to staying at more budget-friendly hotels, but when planning my short stay in Chicago, this Hilton was actually cheaper than some of the other hotels downtown, so I jumped on it. I really enjoyed my stay here. I was allowed to check in early when I arrived, which was very much appreciated, as I was a hot ass mess from walking and dragging my suitcase the few blocks from the blue line. I asked about a room with a view, but it was another $25/night, so I passed. My room did not have the infamous (?) two bathroom setup, but my one bathroom was just fine. My water pressure was great, even up on the 19th floor, and my fixtures weren't tarnished and looked really nice, unlike what some of the other reviewers experienced. The bed was super comfortable, and I loved how white and crisp the sheets and duvet were. And their pillows - oh my God, I wanted to steal them all, they felt like clouds under my head. The location of the hotel was nice, just a few blocks away from the Harrision red line stop, so it is super convenient to get to/from places pretty quickly. What I really liked was the check out process. Maybe other hotels have this, but I've never experienced it. Not only did I not have to wait in line to check out, like the mass of people that were doing so when I left on Sunday morning, but I was able to print out my boarding pass for free! All I had to do was check out through my TV, then send my boarding pass to their print station in the lobby. Genius, and pain free. When the mood hits me to get back up to Chicago, I will definitely be checking out the Hilton again.;4;2;1;2;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1253;3/2/2011;CMgRr4A2AtYgm3XUQxZb1w;TIrOT3y33xydiOnNSqDvOA;I was fortunate enough to stay here for my birthday back in December. It is located right on Michigan Ave across from the Lake and the parks! Great location for a view, but in terms of things around it, there are not many shops or restaurants. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. One thing I didn't like was the ceilings of the lobby were really low, but there was a beautiful area with a huge Christmas tree. I got this hotel on Priceline and when we checked in, we were able to get a room with a gorgeous view. I was so happy! When we walked in, there was a computer that was playing musiak and had a personalized greeting on the front. Everything was nice and clean and I considered the bed to be comfy. Also, do not come to Chicago with a car. Parking is ridiculously expensive. 40 bucks and up each night. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in town.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1255;4/5/2011;mKVOt9CAgUiJw5xxIR4saA;DKMpCblFCdILcym7l7vvxg;I have been to the Hilton Chicago on several occasions, and all times  were for work.  The first time was in 2009 for my association's Interim BOT meeting.  The second time was for a site-visit for my association's Annual Conference, and the third time was for the actual conference. On a personal level as a guest: 2009 - I had to stay a night for work and I found the room, as well as the hotel, to be dark, out-dated, and almost haunted.  I was so freaked out in my room, which was a basic king room, that I stayed up and watched The Hangover and ordered a pizza through room service.  I ended up sleeping with the light on (yes, I am scared of the dark and this hotel room didn't help) 2011 - Stayed here the last night of my conference and got a pretty sweet room.  It was a King Jr. Suite and it had a view of museum campus and the lake.  Too bad I was working and couldn't really enjoy it for long.  I still found the room to be small, but less dark and out-dated than 2009. Either way, this would NOT be my first pick if I was visiting Chicago.  The hotel has a lot of history, and certainly has one of the most beautiful ballrooms I have seen as well as amazing suites - both the Conrad and the Imperial Suites are breath-taking, but an average person would not be paying to stay there.  If anything, I say visit the hotel on a tour, but dont' pay the money to stay there unless 1) you get a great deal or 2) can afford one of the suites.  While the hotel isn't centrally located to many Chicago attractions it is close to museum campus, the infamous Buddy Guy Legends, and is a short cab ride to the Magnificent Mile. On a professional level as a meeting planner: 1) The exhibit space isn't ideal for exhibitors especially if you are on the Lower Level because of all the columns.  The meeting rooms, with the exception of the 2nd and 3rd floor, are small and cramped and make you feel like you're in elementary school again. 2) The prices are ridiculous - I have never been to a property that charges so much for a gallon of coffee!  We definitely had to have a serious conversation with them in regards to pricing for items such as coffee, internet, and electrical.  As a planner, consider yourself warned, and be prepared to discuss bringing prices down and compromising in certain areas. 3) The staff - everyone from the front desk, facilities, banquets, the blue coats, to covention services and even the chef and GM are beyond amazing!  I have worked meetings at a lot of properties and the Hilton Chicago staff are definitely up there.  They were extremely accommodating, professional, and a true pleasure to work with.   If I am still with the association in 2014, I look forward to going back just to be able to work with their staff.;3;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1256;9/13/2008;SfLRk0BClf7KxdnJm2LnBg;odq8SUSIT8narMOKlZrg6Q;I've never stayed at this Hilton before.  Usually I'm close to the river, but I was in town for a conference at the Hilton and the conference rate was good, so I got to check the place out. It's a big, old hotel.  It's well maintained, but there are things about big, old hotels that aren't great.  It's a long walk from your room to the elevators.  If you want a hot shower, you'll have to let the water run for a while.  If you want a great view, you probably won't have it.  Check in was efficient, housekeeping usually gets it right, and the catering was decent enough that we didn't go out to dinner after eating the snacks at our conference reception.  The rooms are ready for a refresh, but the public spaces were impressive. John McCain and his entourage were in the hotel for a while in the afternoon and evening.  Security was there, and they did a good job of not inconveniencing people who were there for other reasons.  Supposedly when this hotel was built, it was the biggest in the world.  That's not hard to believe and the staff manages things well but if I could pick a hotel for next time, I'd pick a newer one that was maybe a mile further north.;2;2;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1257;2/5/2009;LKcpspmcFX;BqXuN5mp4_w41CccL55H4Q;I've never stayed here- but I do VIP hotel accommodations for perhaps the most powerful businessman in the world.  I've visited every luxury hotel in Chicago, and intensely scrutinized every Presidential suite and penthouse- and I think the most luxurious is the Hilton Presidential suite. Their sales rep for our request took us on a full tour of the hotel, gave us historical background as we toured (really fascinating history), and a very elegant front entrance off of Michigan Ave.  A nice touch- the United Airlines check-in kiosk by the hotel check-in counter.  You can kill 2 birds withone stone before you even head out to O'Hare. The views are stunning if your room faces East.   The hotel is beautiful, the Presidential suite is exquisite, and their sales staff was intensely helpful ad friendly and paid us a lot of attention.  I appreciate their help- as my list of questions and inquiries before the VIPs arrive is quite extensive.;4;2;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1258;11/14/2007;j24aTaTRNimr7OalK-h56Q;8k4y8CvcC5oL-rKFMxHb0g;I stayed here a week ago and was lucky to use some of my Hilton points and was upgraded to the Executive Floor on the 24th floor. The first thing you notice when you walk into the hotel is the decor in the lobby, which seems to span on forever into ballrooms, meeting rooms, restaurants, and small shops. The colors are very warm and comforting as are the staff and everyone that greets you. My room had two beds and two bathrooms which was a bit excessive, but it comes with the whole upgrade. The view was decent as I was on the 24th floor, but I was caddy cornered between two points of the huge building that jut out and it was kind of a limited view. The room was very clean and everything was top class as Hiltons usually are. One thing of note was the gym. It was absolutely huge. If you are into working out when you travel you will truly enjoy the gym experience here. Even though the weights and machines may be a little old, there is HUGE variety for a hotel gym and even a mini track that goes around all the equipment. Plenty of TV's and a great view of the city make working out easy. The location of the hotel is superb. Plenty of restaurants in the Loop as well as shops and sites to see everywhere. My only complaint is the concierge. I needed to extend my stay by a day and I went to ask him what could be done. He said the hotel was booked and then gave me the number for http://hotels.com. THAT is shocking. I'm a Diamond VIP member at Hilton and the last thing I want to hear a concierge tell me is to call http://hotels.com. I'm not trying to be rude or cocky or anything, but he could have at least referred me to another Hilton or Hilton family hotel.

1259;12/18/2007;PODjERCp4BFVY;Hj8XSXWjcvuz7dE7udjnvg;This really feels like an old-time big city hotel.  Its grand in many ways, and the location can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Ave, its a short cab ride or a long-ish walk to the shops in one one direction and Soldier Field in the other.  If you're visiting in the summer, the park is literally across the street, and the view of the lake is perfect.   The lobby is very impressive, as you would expect from these grand old hotels, and if you get a chance, peek into the ballrooms and look up.  Really impressive - there are a lot of elements you will find throughout the property that has the charm you won't find at the more modern Hyatt convention/hotel places.  Of course the tradeoff is that rooms may be a bit smaller and the fixings are a bit dated. I had a corner room which provided great views through multiple windows, but I sense that it could be a little drafty on cold, windy winter days.  Overall though, very cozy and comfortable.  I'd recommend this hotel for out of town visitors, especially those with kids because there's room to run around in the lobby floors, and great access to the park and lake.;4;2;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1260;7/17/2010;jdqIWr;SIySnJpBtbblm_j3sOG4Yg;There is no doubt that the Hilton Chicago sits in an ideal location of Chicago. It is in walking distance from the Art Institute, Grant & Millennium Parks, the L, and likely the best coffee in Chicago,  Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea. However, the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. While historic and magnificent in its own right, it's functionality leaves little to be desired. I found the plumbing to be poor (low water pressure), fixtures gaudy (gold and tarnished), and sadly, the overall cleanliness questionable. I'd rather spend a bit more for the W or perhaps even settle for the hostel around the corner. Love you, Chicago. Don't love you, Hilton Chicago :(.;2;1;1;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1261;1/6/2007;84YoNScquLWEjGEBsWEDtA;BI4lPhrUpmEySIJUywjIjQ;I was here for a Chinese New Year Celebration a couple years back and the place was a maze - you could easily get lost here - the celebration took over many different ballrooms and the staff was very friendly in handling the huge crowd and answering my silly questions of getting lost.  What makes the Sheraton most memorable for me was after a long night of eating and making polite conversation, my boyfriend (just dating at the time) and I hid away at a small bar downstairs drinking Long Islands listening to the cd that the bartender had playing and he claims that was the moment that he realized he was falling in love with me. Edit: We' just got married there.  There were some ups and downs and miscommunication, but in the end, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Robert Neubert was a pleasure to work with and helped make the day go by smoother.  Our rooms were a bit small but I love the fact that you can actually get a hotel room with two bathrooms with two double beds - what a great deal!  They also treated us to the Daley Suite for our wedding night - what a wonderful experience!;5;1;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1262;10/18/2007;RAQ3dDnWeUmjIbp8wr;9DPtOR39gFcs7A_lysyZzg;This hotel is nearly as old as Chicago itself ... built in the 20's and was the largest hotel in the world when it opened.  And it's grand ... very ornate with lots of wide open spaces and marble, marble, everywhere. The service I experienced was lovely.  Although as per usual I was there on business so everything I needed was utilitarian.  But I was impressed and folks that worked for the hotel were very nice. The weird thing was the set up of the rooms.  I was "upgraded" to the executive floor ... 24th Floor!! ... which I thought would be cool but I guess they converted the room from 2 to 1.  There were 2 double beds (not queens) in the room, 2 closets and 2 full bathrooms!  That would have all been ok, I guess, if there had been a King. Our conference was in the main ballroom and if you are looking for a ritzy place to thow a HUGE party, give it a try.  It was fancy.  One of the speakers actually told a story of being a teenager and attending a cotillion there.  That's the kind of fancy I'm talking about. Anyway, good spot!  I'd go back!;4;1;1;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

All the history behind this place, combined with the comfort and overpowering amenities make it a great place to stay. The bars downstairs are great, and the food in the restaurants are above standard for hotel food for sure. There is also a lounge area next to the check-in desk as you would find in most hotel lobbies, but they do an exceptional job of keeping in mind that this is a classy place. The only downfall is that it's a little far south if you're coming here soley to shop. If you're going for comfort and convenience to the loop, you are crazy if you don't consider booking.;4;1;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1266;11/28/2007;Fqm;6vlB2FYf2dGVWte9cViVcg;Its a huge hotel, this Hilton. Don't get lost. If you're driving to it, parking is a bit tricky. Do not pull up in front of it on Michigan Ave. Instead, drive past, turn right, turn right again, turn right again and viola, you'll be in the right spot. Where the bellmen will help you unload your crap, point you toward self-parking or valet your piece of crap car as if it were a brand new Porsche. The rooms are standard fare for Chicago hotels of this calibre. Nothing special. Nothing negative. The resto in the lobby area is actually not bad.

Well, my room had not one but two bathrooms. Two full bathrooms? Three cheers for needless excess! I really like the Hiltons in Chicago.

Couldn't ask for a better room... love the dual plugs in the lamb on each nightstand.  Totally awesome hotel layout.  Apparently the building was put up in 1929, and it looked like it was probably THE spot back in those days.  My only gripe was the overpriced ($14.95/day!!!) wifi.  Staff was excellent, though!;4;0;1;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1269;8/20/2011;xtjxo0T-nzs4vNf6HLk6qQ;arl1zyc5GEtipgEOSjuAVg;Loved this hotel! Why? I was staying here on a business trip for a trade show and sharing a room with a colleague. When I asked about an upgraded room, the front desk gal said "no problem". I went up to our room and it looked pretty standard. I thought to myself, "maybe she thought being on the club level was a good enough upgrade". And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a door on the other side of the room that was half open. "What is that?", I thought. I walked over and opened the door and looked in. Woo! Hoo! It was a second bathroom!!! It was a dream to be traveling with someone and we were each able to have our own space. The best Hilton upgrade ever. Aside from that, the pub in the hotel has pretty good food (and beer). The location of the hotel was great for what we were there for. The fitness center was $15 for a day or $25 for the entire stay. At first, I hesitated. I paid the $25 and was not disappointed. It was actually a gym for people in the neighborhood. It had an indoor track and a ton of cardio machines and weights. Worth every penny.;4;1;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1270;4/15/2009;yW5iYtCDgOupp1SsqrhnNA;aoTnCXg4_sllZxNJeTDHAA;I stayed here last weekend for some family-time.  I was initially disappointed when I found out we'd be staying here as opposed to one of the "hipper" hotels in the area.  My opinion very quickly changed.  The Chicago Hilton is one of the grand dame luxury hotels in Chicago.  They've hosted a bunch of presidents, celebrities, rich folks, etc and they've got the system down pat.  Luxurious well-appointed spaces, an attentive staff, a tony location and comfortable rooms make this a great hotel.  The ball rooms are absolutely gorgeous - dripping in elegance,class and timeless beauty.  The spa, fitness center and pool/hot tubs are clean and lovely.   We booked a suite - a great upgrade at only a small price jump - and were delighted by the amount of room we had including many many windows, a Murphy bed, a bar, sweeping lake views and lots of storage.  The only downside of the room was the tiny bathroom with very little counter space.  Oh well.... I got over it.   One more thing to note - We ate in all of the restaurants (Kitty O'Shea's, Lakeside Green Lounge (the hotel bar) and The Pavilion) and found the food disappointing in each - overpriced, underwhelming, and very limited in choices.  Your best bet is to take advantage of one of the many wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer and skip the hotel's food offerings altogether.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1271;3/18/2010;ryNoLpjCrdVaBWkVopL-Aw;mjOKUSdIqxFPSYMB-MmS9g;Came to Chicago on March 13, day of the Green River Day Parade, for St. Patrick's Day. The hotel is festive, everyone in green and convincing everyone that walks in to do the same. The had a little booth, right in front of their Irish Bar/ Restaurant - Kitty O'Sheas-, with all things St. Patrick's (tiaras, shirts, necklaces, and more). Their energy is contagious so, of course, I go in and buy something for everyone in my party. Before we join the madness at Kitty O'Sheas, I go check-in. Lady at the counter was really nice. Check-In process took less than 5 minutes. They even had arranged all clocks at the rooms to change automatically for day light savings. Room is big, spacious, clean... so is the bathroom. Mini bar (you can ask for the key when checking-in), TV, desk, big enough closet, and more features to make your stay comfortable.  Oh, but do bring your own soap, the one they have is brutal on your nails and skin.   Back downstairs, St. Patrick's celebration has intensified. Kitty O'Sheas' is packed, with a line of people waiting outside, without and estimated seating time. Would have loved to stay and celebrate but after waking up at 6:30am, traveling without anything to eat, I needed lunch fast. So we leave, with our green accessories to another restaurant, promising ourselves we would have our green beer when we got back. At night the hotel has security, who checks your room key before allowing you into the elevators. They have a piano at the entrance, a lounge/ bar. Apparently this hotel is very popular for conventions, conferences, etc. Saw people from 3 different ones in one weekend. This might be a problem if your traveling to get away and rest. I'm sure it might be a bit quieter on non-holiday weekends but gotta love a hotel with that spirit, good service and, on top of that, close to just about everything on Michigan Ave.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1275;1/26/2010;huUCCteJ4R6YNrAyTH8hAg;o_9F3uGQ4D9vDaakqaWWSg;My husband and I stayed here the night we eloped and got married. We stayed in a realllly high up room that overlooked the water. It was pretty rad that we could see an up close and personal view of the fireworks at the Navy Pier at night, but overall we were fairly unimpressed by the room itself. Sure it was nice, but we got charged quite a bit extra for a room with a "view" and the window was tiny tiny tiny. I just feel like if you're charging for a view that it should be a helluva view . Biggest pet peeve: So we get here the night we got married after we had already previously arrived to settle in, and our room is hotter than dammit at 10pm when we had definitely left the AC running. We call the front desk and tell them about it, and we were just sitting there in our fancy clothes waiting for someone to come up to fix it because we didn't want to be in the shower...or uh, consummating when they got there. So we waited 30 minutes, then 45. After 3 angry phone calls to the front desk, a very friendly serviceman arrives to fix the filter on our A/C. He then proceeds to explain what the problem was. He was nice and we were appreciative, but man, I just got married. I don't care what the problem was, just get out of my room so I can get busy. And of course, we never got any compensation or apology for the annoyance. But I'm still married, so I guess it didn't turn out to be too big of a deal, haha. Overall, the location is what would make this place worth it. Other than that, save your pennies and stay elsewhere.;2;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1277;5/9/2010;2ygtypL2638o1foYq;c0iNwspfOONJg4guAjs_ig;I lucked out when I stayed here. Came into town early to tour a college with my daughter before staying longer for a work-related convention at McCormick Place. We were able to check in before the scheduled time and the kind receptionist sized me up and suggested a room with a king bed to accommodate my height. We were checked in and were able to drop off our luggage within 10 minutes. Fortunately, the internet was included for convention attendees so that wasn't a sore point for me. My daughter and I had been using the L and CTA to get around so parking wasn't an issue either. My room was on the lake side but in near the lobby. It was larger with a couch in the sitting area by the desk, four windows toward the lake, and a wet bar with a fridge. I can't complain. One event from the convention was at the Buddy Guy Legends bar down across the street. When my friend and I had enough of the Belgian beer they happened to be serving that night, we came back to Kitty O'Shea's in the Hilton and listened to some guys playing some great Celtic-style music. The sitting area in the Lakeside Green Lounge was very comfortable as well, and the park is right across the street. I like the classic old style that this hotel exudes. Sure, there are some things that might be considered out of date, but I found it to be tastefully appointed and the bed was real comfortable. I'd stay here again if I needed to be in the area.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

The had live gambling for a charity at the hotel in the basement. The International ballroom had over 3,000 people in it and I was one of them. This was a paid event. I would say if I paid for the ticket I wouldn't have been so excited to be there. Bitbull came on at the last minute after NYE right when I couldn't hold it in anymore (pee pee alert). I was in the front row the jump-smokers are great ! Took some video of them dancing on stage. The drinkers were unlimited and so was the food. The food was not that great mostly pasta and pizza. I would say the bartenders were doing a great job keeping up with the orders even though  the line was a mile long. The  confetti drop was nice but they could have spent a little more money and had ballons too. What was nice is that  my boyfriend and I found his friends after an hour of searching in the crowd.

The hotel is nice:but it can only get so nice for an oldie...no matter how much money you dump into it.  Shower head was really low (I'm 6'1"), water pressure was low.   It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by (check out reviews on Yelp!) For some off reason I ended up with two double beds (they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone). If traveling here: 1 - make sure you get a better deal than I did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - Don't have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class (although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple...it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers (sp?) trying to save money.;2;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

My room did not have 2 bathrooms as several others have mentioned, but I think it's because I had a corner room. The second day of my stay, the cleaning crew took my iron!

The rooms were standard Hilton-above average quality and cleanliness. The lobby bar was nice for evening cocktails. I liked seating at a table in the window overlooking the Michigan Avenue traffic. However, be prepared to pay around $12.00 per cocktail. The only thing I would change would be the size and quality of the executive floor amenities. The club lounge was tiny and there was always a line for beverages or snacks.  But-let me say, the executive level staff was fantastic! They helped me arrange a dinner meeting at a local restaurant.

BAD: - One morning, I had only lukewarm water in the shower :(. - They seem to wash towels whether you want them to or not.  That's wasteful. - Don't bother with their restaurant, Pavillion.  Very mediocre food (at best).  Fruits: hard as a rock and flavorless.  Prawn salad = four tasty prawns on top of unsurprisingly wilted greens that are sitting in about a 2 inch-deep mixture of orange juice and water (well, that's what the dressing tasted like).  Lobster bisque soup:  Where's The Beef?  Er, I mean lobster.  Even the bisque part wasn't very tasty.  In short, yuck! - As with nearly all Hiltons, it seems, you get nickeled and dimed.  They charge you $1.50 per bag checked in their storage, for crying out loud.  That's a complimentary service at *every* other hotel I've stayed at.  And $15/day for wireless?  $25 for late checkout?  $6 for the unfrigerated bottle of water on your desk?!   - Assuming it's the Hilton that caters conference lunches... YUCK!!!  Could they not have varied the sandwich choice once in five days?!  Or offered a sandwich that didn't taste like eating flavorless sawdust? - Christmas music.  24/7 in the lobbies.  Not even very good Christmas music, mind you... just schmaltzy crap on and on and on... - Beds were too soft to be comfortable. *  *  * I was conflicted between 2 and 3 stars here.  I'd say 2.5, but decided on 2 due to the crappy dining options in the hotel and the nickel-and-diming (admittedly typical in most high-end hotels, but that doesn't make it right).;2;3;0;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

I'd never stay here if I had to pay for it myself.  After the experience here, I always double-check and call hotels to ask about their fitness facilities and daily gym charges.  Lesson learned, thank you for that!;2;2;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1289;3/16/2006;9MrCXhWA4HylIme1KeypWg;z-KkYvu4klkBOSUfgKoTJQ;Great Hotel! One of the most impressive lobby's I have ever experienced. The rooms are very comfortable and cozy. I was won over by the great service the staff offered, especially when you have requests at odd hours of the night.

1293;12/30/2008;XfV1bDvZfYvIgzRfxsVMXQ;Ke2bI_8U-s9KEhbRWuTcoQ;Bad experience. Just bad. Arrived at midnight after a long flight. I had booked a room the month before. Was told that they were overbooked, so I had a choice of a "parlor room" or a smoking room for the first night (then get moved for the next two), since no non-smoking rooms were left. The parlor room was supposed to be "better" and have a bed that was "closer to the ground" (??) and they offered to discount my rate. Fine. I get to the room and my key doesn't work. Go downstairs to get a second key. Also doesn't work. Finally they send someone from security to meet me there to let me in. When I get in, I realize that the room. Has. No. Bed. They had given me the living room half of an executive suite (kitchen with sofas). I called downstairs about this and they offered to bring in a roll-away. Incredible. Had a long call with the manager on duty who kept insisting that they had no more non-smoking rooms for the night. After a while, he caved and let me have a non-smoking room from a block of rooms that some other group had reserved which was not being used. So they had extra non-smoking rooms all along? Why the charade? So this new room was fine. Of course, I had to move for the next two nights. To try to make up for the issue the first night, the next morning's manager promised that they had given me a "really nice room". It turned out to be a corner room with great views. But. The heater didn't work. (I didn't try to change rooms again.) After all that, when I was checking out, they had charged me the original rate for all three nights! The person checking me out asked how my stay was. I said, "Well..." and then they comped me for one night. I spoke with some other people staying in the hotel, and apparently the issue with the heaters was widespread. In the middle of winter in Chicago, they have broken heaters...;1;1;0;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

The concierge and operators were incredibly helpful. We called for a toothbrush and got it in 5 minutes. They have computers in your room that help you find local restaurants, shopping and entertainment. There are over 17 floors in this hotel, but they have 14 elevators, so you do not have to wait long. Check out is a breeze- you can literall phone it in. Beds are so comfortable that we considered hanging out in bed all day. The TVs have limited channels, and our remote only worked from a certain angle. The bathrooms are really nice and the bath products were great. Plenty of towels available, and the softest pillows you will ever sleep on. I loved this place, highly recommended.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

It is a Chicago institution, that's for sure.  It's not going to be a chic hotel:it's in an old building with smaller rooms. (It's bigger than the Allerton!) I do have to say the food at the restaurants is overpriced for what you get and the internet charge is outrageously high. Most hotels aren't even charging anymore and Chgo H and T needs to get with the times. Otherwise, we'll stay here again and always request a lake view room.;3;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Our hotel room was TINYYY and really awkwardly laid out.  As a result, the furniture not only looked oudated but gawdy too.   -The TV was NEXT TO, not in front of, the bed.  Looks like they just tried to cram it in there, because really, there was no space.   -There was no vent in the bathroom, so hot showers meant a cloudy bedroom. -Wifi is available for $12.50 a day, or $3.50 an hour... most hotels offer this service for free.  It's 2008, dude!! -They nickle and dime you... I'm with Adam L on this one.  Yes, $6 for an unrefrigerated bottle of water next to the TV.  I know that the Hilton hotels target people with money, but do they assume they're stupid too? Tee hee-- Speaking of nickels, the Hilton Chicago has these tiny rooms shaped like a "5", if drawn solely with straight lines. A squiggly hallway connects the bedroom and living room.  (wags finger) Shame on you for attempting to pass these as rooms!;2;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1303;6/14/2010;3bvFYdfVPhyqjKPJc1pCzQ;7wp_W6I3CEf8m_M2GCgX9A;WORST HOTEL EVER!!! Please do not stay here. I should have listened to all the bad reviews posted by others at Trip Advisor. Paid about $190 to get a room here...totally not worth it. When we first checked in, we were told that the non smoking room that we reserved is not available and there is no other room available.  When we get to the room, the smell of the room was pretty bad...so we asked the front desk to check again. He told us that there is one room available, but it was a living room of a suite. But   the living room has been secluded now from the suite and the sofa can be turned into a bed. Hello!?!??! Did I pay for the room/bed or a living room with sofa? I could have stayed at a friend's apartment (for free!!) and sleep on her sofa if I wanted to do that.   Pros: - Looks good from the outside (inside totally not worth it) - Close to the millennium park (about 6-8 blocks?) But I am sure there's better hotels that are closer to downtown and better for the price. Cons: - Got a smoking room even though I reserved non-smoking room. When I read reviews online, it seems like this is their common practice to do this. Beware!!   - Room is dirty (There was a BIG spider on the wall when we got into the room) - Some portions of the carpet was WET (Gross!!) - Bed, decorations, bathroom are OLD. They really need to get updated. - Internet is $7.50 per hour, with no business center to check your email (Hotels like hampton inn can offer $130 a night with free internet and breakfast...and I don't know why Hilton can't...pretty ridiculous) - They seriously nickel and dime you for everything!! To leave your luggage for a couple of hours, you have to pay $2 per bag. - Beware of the extra charges. They slip me a bill for $6.40 for I do not know what. I called the front desk and asked what the charge is for, and they asked me if I took something from the bar and I told them no. Then they just dismiss it (imagine if you had not called). - Arrogant and full of attitude staff Definitely not a place I want to stay the next time I come to Chicago. Totally not worth the price!! Everyone should just avoid it. Every staff has some kind of attitude like this Hilton was the best hotel in the city (maybe in the late 80s or early 90s) but I don't think it is up to par with other hotel I've stayed in. My previous stay in Chicago was at Sheraton by the river...much nicer, more elegant and friendlier staff.;1;1;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1304;8/13/2007;y3GB286CiGyWOMBb9RErIw;fcNU65OaCj7slBJ60VSQgw;I was going on a booze cruise Saturday night and didn't want to drive. I had made the reservation about a month ago, but didn't realize that the LaSalle run was on Sunday. The place was packed to the rafters. I checked in at 3:45 and the line was pretty long but it moved quickly. I asked for a king size because I was told on the phone that doubles were the only thing available. I was very suprised when they gave it to me with a full bar and living room overlooking Grant Park. Score! I was going to put the bag full-o-liquor in the washroom. I called everyone over for a pre-boat party. We almost didn't make it. The room was nice. It had a bed that folded into the wall? It was a little low, but very comfortable. The decor? Hmm. A little dated. I know that they spent 185 million 22 years ago to gut the joint. But. It's 07 going on 8. Spring for some curtains at least. What would Paris say? But, who am I to bitch. I just got jacked up. It's a beautiful hotel. Just not as nice as the competition. And that list keeps growing.;3;0;0;1;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
1305;7/29/2010;d-lHBfw6UgYrjFfQx6aWMQ;7kqBPRRSwCikGfE_5led8Q;The Chicago Hilton is a fixture in Chicago, with a history almost as old as the city itself. As a resident of Chicago, we were looking for a fun place to celebrate the city for an evening. Although we got an excellent rate on this hotel vs. the rates on their website, they want to nickel and dime you like crazy once you get there. Touting themselves as "pet friendly", they charge a $75 NON REFUNDABLE pet fee. Internet access was $25 per day. Even the bottled water that was sitting out on the desk (not in the mini bar) was $6.00. Add on overnight parking for $43, and you're racking up quite a tab for a supposedly 4-star place. The bathroom was tiny, the faucet dripped, and there were fingerprints on the window, even water left in the ice bucket. I am sure this was a grand place in its day, but that day has passed. I was really disappointed when I bid on a hotel for next month and came up with the same place. I can only hope that our experience is better this time, since we can't really do anything about the choice that price line returned. I can say that this is a two and a half to three star place at the very best, and would not suggest it at anywhere close to full price.;2;2;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

1307;7/17/2011;pLnI8HL5IkdLzkGn;qjZstWM3LnEq6JisTCiW_w;This place is a bit odd. They are one of those clubs where Friday night is Latino night, Saturday is african american night, and then they tend to switch it up every other week or something?   Last night my friend forwarded me the 'get in free' text from the promoters.  They wouldn't let me in free because it wasn't from the promoter himself. Weird because word-of-mouth marketing is the best way to go. I couldn't believe the money-takers at the front door that night.  I paid $10 to get in there and then I had to put up a fight to go outside for a quick smoke.  He said "if i let you out, then I have to let everyone out". I think there should be some kind of law that allows you to go outside for fresh air (or not so fresh air lol). Thought America was a free country but who knows.  I think they missed the whole stamp-on-wrist idea that most clubs do to know who's been in and who hasn't. I then had to beg them again to let me out so I could change my shoes. My feet were literally bleeding from my shoes.  They wouldn't. So I took my shoes off and started walking through the club barefoot. That got their attention and they let me go out and come back in. WOW!  It's odd because every other time I had been there they let people outside. I knew it was because of the dudes at the front taking money.  Who the hell hired them? When it's a popular night they overcrowd the place.  It gets ferociously hot in there.  One time they sent out a burst of cold air through the club. It was the best 20 seconds of the night.  Just a tease though because it went right back to being hot. Ill go back because Im forgiving :)  But I don't like being disrespected by the front door staff.  They are kind of rude to the customers. Sometimes I think people forget that the customers pay for them to have that job. We are the reasons they are there. I don't want them to roll their eyes at me for simple requests.;2;3;1;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1308;3/20/2010;DpwAciZza9kpo7Tbv0UjjA;I-MPn5jRfB8-Zl__twxWdQ;Here's the thing: This is Chicago. It is not Manhattan. It is not South Beach. It is not L.A. It is not Paris. This is Chicago. So I need the over-entitled and under-exposed people at Victor Hotel to understand that. I know from "exclusive" clubs. And you, Victor Hotel, are not an exclusive club. You never will be, and you need to stop acting like it. I've only been here at the invitation of younger (that is to say "20-something") friends for birthday celebrations, and to a time, I regretted going. It's like a bad scene from 1994, with unnecessary lines, a ridiculous cover and bottle service, and the ever-elusive "list". Here's my thing: I don't stand in line anywhere. And that is not pretention, it is the truth. I happen to work in a profession that has afforded me access to "exclusive" places -- much better than Victor Hotel. So, I don't stand in line. And I definitely don't stand in line at a bootleg club in the industrial district in what we're now calling the "West Loop." My other thing -- I do not beg to get in. If I tell you that I'm on the list and drop the name we both know and agree is the contact, let me the hell in without a shakedown! Maybe if I was in my 20s and never lived outside of Chicago, I'd think it was a hot place to be. But I know the kind of bad fruit these folks are selling and I don't want it. The last time I was there, I was so worn down from standing in line (because my name mysteriously disappeared or was never on "the list"), conceding to paying a $20 cover (because my name mysteriously disappeared or was never on "the list"), and trying and failing to get table service replenishments, that I couldn't even enjoy the DJ. I was too irritated. I paid my respects to the birthday girl and kept it moving -- knowing that I wouldn't set foot in this joint again. I'll leave it to the kids who still enjoy it because they don't know any better. And I'll keep partying elsewhere with grown folks.;2;13;5;9;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

1310;9/14/2010;-RsdMX80d3rxJjczZ62Png;vpveUMn3Am1c6gC4QdDxNQ;I wish I could give a place zero stars.   First off let me start off by saying I hate clubs.  My very good friend wanted to celebrate a milestone birthday but didn't want to go to a bar because she wanted us all to get dressed up. So last minute she decided to set up a party here. We get there and get to skip the line. We were suppose to have a table reserved because bottles were being bought. We get there someone else is in our spot. We end up having to get another bottle to get seated somewhere else. Super shady.   We get seated by the super busy main area. With a party of 20+ that didn't work out so well. So they had to move us to the back.  Whatever. Good times were had. Until I go to bar to get a drink because I wanted something else.  The bartender was being a scumbag after someone took my friends drink and I told her. She was being such a douche about it and I wasn't even asking for another one free.  I had to explain to her so many times to give my friend his card back and we'll pay cash. She refused a few times. Saying we haven't met the limit. Which we had. She really gave us a hard time. But finally gave it back.   Then at the end of the night while my girl was paying for the bottle they bring her the slip to sign but tell her they had just lost her card!  They just had it and lost it in 5 minutes?! What the?! My girl refused to sign until she got her card back. This went on for twenty minutes.  The birthday girl happened to know one of te bouncers, she told him what was going on. He comes back in five minutes WITH her card!!!!!!  What the hell is that? She was so mad, they did nothing to apologize or take a little of the bill for the hassle.   Do not give these people your credit cards. I know there is something fishy about this place...;1;8;1;2;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1311;6/18/2008;FM4u5i7fJa03AQb6kyliEA;Y3zSBLnhcl4w55QCAQWo1A;OK, I'ma preface this by saying I'm only writing this review of this place I've been to once because it's the only "new" place I've been to in awhile, and I guess I'm long overdue for a review.  Also, I only went here because my friend was deejaying, and I drove all the way to Dekalb from work to pick up my other friend who's car broke down and then drove all the way to Chicago only to get lost for over 2 MORE hours because my friend the "navigator" that I picked up thought that our dj friend told him to turn on FULLERTON when it was FULTON the entire time.  All in all I drove basically 6 hours to get to this damn place so I'm already a little biased walking in here. First of all, there's a dress code apparently (even though my dj friend said there wasn't.)  After some explaining and talking to a bouncer and a manager they let us in with our sneakers as long as I took off my hat.  Awesome bouncer, but right off the bat I find out it's not the kind of place I would normally go to. Secondly, drinks.  It was sponsored by Hennessey that night but unfortunately it didn't do a damn thing for drink prices.  $6 for the average selection of beers and $8 a mixed drink and $9 a shot.  Average prices for some clubs but this ain't exactly the place you can get your "drink on" on my budget. Thirdly, Victor "HOTEL?"  Not only did my friend get the streets mixed up, but we were looking for an actual hotel the whole time.  What's the deal with these places with false-advertisey names? (Like US Beer Company, which is not an actual brewery or anything and they run out of beers a lot of times too.)  Are people actually running out of names for these clubs and bars?  I know it's a "thing" but call it "Victor Club" or "Victor you'll never find us in this meat-packing district bar" or something. There's a couple of little rooms from what I could see, not sure if they were VIP and I believe there was an upstairs as well (which I'm also unsure of its VIP statusness.)  I mostly congregated around the dj stage drinking my anger away.  Apparently they were doing live art somewhere too which I was too late to witness. The music is a moot point because I obviously liked it since my friend was deejaying, so I'm not sure what their normal selection of music is but by the judging of all of Frodo's cousins there looking confused (the Douche Baggins) I got a feeling that they weren't playing what the normal crowd comes to hear.  Parking is valet only unless you're lucky to find a spot (which is nigh impossible.) All in all, the online magazine that was throwing this party is trying new adventurous things and places, but I don't think this particular place is one I'm coming back to.  Two and a half stars.  Hey, it could be great for all I know, but I don't care.  SIX-HOURS.;2;4;2;5;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

Very cool decor, especially the freezer doors and nude photography on the walls, but this place sure think's they're big shit. Come on.  It's not like there's a shortage of "upscale" nightspots in Chicago. If this place wasn't a pain in the ass to get to (Hello, this is a Transit-oriented city!) and/or was in a neighborhood that didn't always smell like rotting meat/produce, you might be able to pull it off.  As is, you're only getting 2 stars because of the decor.;2;5;2;3;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1313;10/18/2009;5qAbjHq3aWf50D2l-T;T2-nZ41zcT02fdbFHFYhzw;I was finagled into going to this place for someone's birthday.  Um. . . can we take a minute to discuss why this "nightclub" set up shop away from Lake St amongst a whole bunch of warehouses? I felt like a real-life horror film was taking place a block away.  I think some guy got shot up by "organized crime" right over there a couple of weeks before the day I went. No, I'm being for serious. Ladies. . . . this is definitely not somewhere you want to be walking down the street to alone.  Shoot, men too! Yea, it looks suspect outside but you get in and it looks like it  used to be a pretty jukin joint at one time. But it really is too small for the amount of people they let in there. If you don't get there early when the crowd is still a little sparse, you will have a hard to getting a drink at the bar or even making your way to the bar at all. Once it gets crowded there really isn't any distinction between what's the dance floor and what isn't. You'll be at the bar trying to get your drink while one half of a dancing couple may be bouncing their butt against your hip.  My face: Not Amused. The speakers are huge and it's hard to be close enough where you can really feel the music and far enough away that you don't that annoying ring in your ears after you leave. Don't you hate that sound? And seating? Forget about it.  The few seats that are around are claimed by the early birds and conquered throughout the rest of the evening by their party.   Overall, the place wasn't my steez at all. I already have issues with paying $10 and up to get into some place to listen to non-live music without anything else included. So, if I'm going to do it I certainly need it to be worth my while. The Victor Hotel is not, but if you like big crowds, sub-par yet still expensive drinks, and that ring in your ears at the end of the night, this Vic's for you.;2;4;2;4;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

In fact, everyone here seems to take themselves seriously...from the $10 valet parking in a completely deserted street parking area, to the bouncer complete with list and velvet ropes, to the $100 Jack Daniel bottles with a price markup simply because you're enjoying it VIP styley. Best bet: show up for one of the million open bar parties they have, get there real early because this place gets crazy packed, and bring dirty friends to deter the smooth walkin' illiterate man action that is bound to come your way.;2;3;2;4;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1315;9/6/2010;NlzroGiz3Ofil5O60k2dRg;hIJYkr014SZsXYg7k5ECPw;I was conflicted on rating this establishment "A-ok" or "Meh". Frankly, it's possible to experience both in one night depending on what happens.  The Victor Hotel was good, the music was lively, there were a barrage of lovely women dressed beautifully and the music almost seemed to compliment their desire to feel gorgeous and enjoy a night of fun.  To this I salute The Victor Hotel and promise that I will return.   Additionally, I had a chance to have a meeting with Carlos Zambrano, I bought him a glass of red wine, I had never expected that he would be a wine drinker but you know "Qu'il en soit ainsi, ainsi soit-il".  I digress, this experience too increased my fondness of The Victor Hotel. Conversely, The Victor Hotel tried to put one over on me and maybe it is not the establishment per se, maybe its the management, maybe even the staff.  Whomever it was, I was brought down quickly  from a sense of enjoyment to the bitterness of reality.  Bartenders, in my experience in communications both verbal and nonverbal one intentionally expresses amicability and in the service industry it pays off.  Wrong night.  Bartender was not friendly, she threw drinks at me, and she visibly rolled her eyes at me when she could not hear me over the music.  I am not saying here reaction was targeted at me.  In fact, I think everyone likes me and everyone wants to be my friend.  So, I continued on my way and use this yelp review as a sort of awareness blog.  Check your ego at the door.  Oh and ask for an itemized bill.  The Victor Hotel adds both gratuity and service charge...suspect I know;2;6;5;5;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1316;6/1/2010;mTbZpHRoI7Lpa;7D-LTcZexcDPURfkT_GLLA;What happened to this place? Victor Hotel has gone the way of so many other clubs. Started off hot, now desperate to make a buck. First, when you arrive, if you don't want to valet your car, then don't drive up to the club on Sangamon. It's a narrow street in the warehouse district with delivery trucks on all sides, making it nearly impossible to turn around. Secondly, after security pats the guys down,  you'll be paying a $20 charge. I came here with a birthday party, and they "had no record" of the party, yet the other people who got there before me didn't pay. Hmm. Victor Hotel conveniently has an ATM. This machine also charges you $4.50 per transaction when you withdraw the $20 needed for cover. Seriously, like other reviewers said, this is Chicago. If I am going to a club that makes you wait in line and charges $20, it better be amazing. Instead, $20 gets you what looks like a garage with strobe lights. The sound system is pretty poor here as well. Stand too far back, and you won't hear much. Stand moderately close to the DJ booth and your ears will ring for two days.;2;4;1;1;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1317;1/25/2007;5Z6k2Sbz-KdAdFkHsxmVKQ;G88KRyzAOuRJ7Gh7VvGBFg;I'm a bit of a sucker for the area with all the history and the grittiness of the hood. The positives: The decor is nice and I did like the meat freezer bathroom doors...a nice touch.  From the outside you'd never expect anything like the place you find inside. The negatives:  $10 cover for guys only. Okay...if the place has some people inside. I visited this joint on a Friday night and was a bit  disappointed.  The place was probably about 15% full and the crowd was a bit older/tamer. Maybe I caught the place on a bad night, but I'm going to have to take pass on this place in the future.;2;2;1;1;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1318;12/23/2007;tMH2ve3IDZISIxIn6SLYnw;4oVhpbewLSSalROZfmy49Q;The people-watching here is fantastic. The reason that there are black and white photos of boobs on the walls is because the type of men who patronize this place still get a kick out of nudity. Oh, and since they're black and white, they're artsy too. These are also the type of men who have seen "Fight Club" way too many times, put too much gel in their hair and at the conclusion of the night, after staring at the same pair of girls for hours, can only muster, "Do you guys make out?" The drinks are wonderful, and admittedly, I wonder the same thing about the girls.;4;1;2;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1319;12/27/2006;-QFdkMB5NvFVQHB692XaiQ;Hv0D0BDrsarzvJSQXVschA;After my one and only visit I give this place 3 1/2 stars, but I have a feeling it will go up after the next time I drop by. The interior is definitely something to see, it's cool in a very odd sort of way. The set-up kind of made me feel like I was in someone's living room (someone with an affinity for pictures of naked women since that's what is all over the walls), but it was very eye-catching and original. The ten dollar cover was a bit annoying since it wasn't particularly crowded and we were inside by 11:00, but I did notice that all of the employees were very friendly and not at all pretentious, which was definitely a nice change. I would recommend starting with drinks at Fulton Lounge, which is just around the corner, and then heading over to Victor Hotel.;3;1;0;1;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1320;7/17/2007;GCiPhVRzhQU2hEPMHU2vQg;cXdFuUc-0g_ogdOMu522hQ;Went there a couple of Saturday's ago.  The interior was nice, and even on such a hot night the air felt pretty cool inside. Bottle service sucks, and should be put away.  It just reinforces that while you may be making money, you really aren't the money, since you have to pay for a place to sit.  Conspicuous consumption has never been truly cool.  I don't think I'll ever give a place a review higher then 3 stars if I have to pay to sit down. It was crowded, but I would say the majority of people there were attending a black/white party in the back room.  If it wasn't for that party, I think it would have been empty (except for my friends and I of course).   (edit) Since there was not much else in regards to crowd, even though it was a weekend, I'm going with 2 stars.;2;1;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1321;10/30/2011;Z3DXRNHecF4EsZyPxsufog;HYxG8hz1Gc9CSrrsDRn7ew;I had never heard of Victor Hotel prior to being invited to celebrate my cousin's birthday here. I was excited to spend a great night with family to celebrate a milestone birthday. However, as soon as I arrived at this place with my sister and brother, our excitement quickly waned. There were so many things that ruined the night that I do not know where to begin, so I will just list them. 1. The valet cost $20. Whenever I get raped like that for parking, I am usually attending an event like a concert not going to a dive that thinks it's a hip club. 2. The line Despite informing the dude at the door that we were attending a birthday party in one of the "private" rooms, we were made to wait with others outside in an unnecessary line. The place wasn't even full, so the line was uncalled for and absolutely ridiculous. When the line finally started moving, one of the door guys was going to separate our three-party group by making me wait and letting my brother and sister go ahead. I had to ask him if he was seriously going to separate me from my twin sister! He then let me go with them. We waited in line for 20 minutes! I am over 30. The only time I ever wait in line is for a Prince concert. So, I was not feeling this "velvet rope" thing at all! 3. Mandatory coat check Once we finally made it into the club after my brother being frisked and my sister and I having our purses searched, we were informed that we HAD to check our coats! I have never been anywhere that REQUIRED a coat check. After all, we were attending a party in a "private room," so why the need to coat check? The coat check was $4 and we were not allowed to check our three light coats together. Just another rip off and annoyance. 4. The cover charge I have been to some great clubs in Chicago and NYC. I do not mind paying a hefty cover for a legendary DJ like Frankie Knuckles in a nice club or lounge. However, NOTHING about Victor Hotel is great - not the venue, the decor, the crowd or the music! Nothing warranted a cover charge of $30 for men and $20 for women. NOTHING!!! The cover was a another rip off! 5. The customer service The overall attitude of the people who "work" at this dump was terrible. The first guy I talked to at the door was a jerk who thought he was important because he was working the door at a third-rate club in the meat packing district that is obviously frequented by people who do not know that there are FAR BETTER places to spend your time and money. When I  tried to ask whether we had to stand in line as guests of a party in a private room, he was very curt and just dismissed me to the line. The second door guy who was going to separate me from my group was also a jerk who joked that I was going to cry if he separated us. It wasn't that serious, but who does that? It is basic club etiquette to let a group enter together, especially a group of three people!!! The cashier had the worst attitude of all. After my brother paid the ridiculous $70 cover for the three of us, she, with a very stank attitude said, "He needs to give me another $10." I informed her that 30+20+20 = the $70 he had just given her, and she just said, "Oh, ok." Then let my sister and me through. I will say the security guard at the front door who frisked and searched us was cool, as was the lady working the valet at the end of the night. The wait staff for the party did a good job. However, overall the attitude of the main workers was awful and enough alone to make me never return. 6. The "private" room The party was in a "private" room in the back of the club. However, other club patrons continuously walked through the party. There was no rope or security to stop people from entering the party. I have never experienced anything like it. At times, I could not figure out who belonged and who did not. There was NOTHING spectacular about what I could see of the decor. It looked like a basement with chairs. There was no real ambiance. The lighting was terrible. The room was so dark that we could barely see each other. The music was so loud that we had to shout to be heard in a whisper. 7. The music The DJ was horrendous. There are far better bedroom DJs around Chicago than whoever was spinning. For a Saturday night this was pathetic. The DJ played endless Jeezy, Gucci and Weezy peppered with played out tracks from Justin Timberlake (Rock Your Body) and Usher (Bad Girl). Those songs might have been popular five years ago, but in 2011? Really? The music was far too loud. The blends were non-existent and the overall playlist was a Rap/R&B/Pop hodgepodge that sounded like someone's iPod on random. The only positive thing about this rat trap is its proximity to the expressway because as soon as I arrived, I wanted to go back to my car, hit 90/94 and go home! This was my first and last time going to Victor Hotel.;1;0;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1322;2/16/2006;-Ti80Ej10zNIwhhz;00Ub26hBqnlwTlRRXWGYLQ;What the heck!  This place--when it was newly opened--was such a delightful breath of fresh air.  Now they went cheapo on the alcohol for their martinis leaving a most unpleasant taste in ones mouth.  :(  You can't tease us with the grey goose and break us with Skyy! It's just cruel. So, one recommendation: specifically request your martinis with your liquor of choice lest your sense of taste be bombarded with clearly subpar alcohol. Eh, I still come back time after time.  It's just something about those Mies Van der Rohe Barcelona chairs--gets me everytime.;3;0;1;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1323;7/9/2007;ML7S99I0Nj4nZl5I5FR2tA;5MI-yPWJ6E-Bgw-CZlFLJQ;I'll have to start off by saying that my friend knew a person working there, so I may be a little biased. My initial impression of this place was definitely "where the heck am I going." It is located in a fairly desolate area in the west loop and we entered in through the back door. Mix the signage on the front and I thought to myself that it should be called "Victor Motel" instead... Inside the place exponentially raises the bar on style and has a definite club/lounge feel. The area itself is very open and had a nice feeling of not being crowded even though we packed it in. The crowd itself was about 50+ of people I knew, so I can't comment on that as everyone was friendly. I did have a few complaints. The first was the requirement that we be stamped for free drinks. This forced me to fight my way back through the crowd even though I had already had a couple rounds without being asked to show anything. Also, they stopped the free drink promo 10 mins early, which ticked off alot of people. (myself included) Otherwise, we did end up getting bottle service and it was by far better than I've been treated elsewhere. We were told upfront that it was $200 and the service was great.;4;0;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1324;6/18/2006;QbQuEnuUjBKlzruUwdFiTw;McW4Az_hS3UmZNX-gWwB3A;My friend Maryanna just got a job promoting, here I am being a good friend, I said I would come.  I'm bringing my roommate's sister Kara.   I never been to Victor Hotel before but I knew the area since I been to other restaurants/lounges. I don't recall hearing about a hotel?  I was thinking who would build a hotel over here in an industrial area?  c'mon this got to be a mistake. Kara and I are in a cab, fast driver, both of us seriously thought about wearing seatbelt.  I'm getting little scared because we saw dozens of people with golf clubs out on the street? What the?? We go inside, holy cow.  Talk about fancy! Red colors everywhere, nice chairs, and very cozy.  But where is everyone? Maryanna!!!!! You said show up at 8pm so here we are whole two of us here with 3 other people.  Maryanna, if you are going to promote your stuff? You have to be here huh?  We stuck around because you said you be right over soon as you are done with Madonna concert. Free drinks, heck yeah...  I didn't eat before I came, in an empty stomach and I always get in trouble. I drink little more than I should when they offer free drinks as well.  Sure enough. Within one hour, I drank down 4 or 5 vodka and cranberry.  I was feeling it for sure. Okay, here comes more people now but no Maryanna yet.  Its 9:45pm place is starting to pick up.  This place use to be a meat factory! You can see little rooms for VIP's and huge refrigerator doors.  Ceiling is high as four 6'ft person stacked up together.  They also have bottle service but no one sat down until 11pm.  Bottle service prices are around $125 - $250 (drink menu) and they have sushi and cheese plate. I also met Greg S. and Rohit, two other Yelp members, very nice guys.   I get back home at 3am.  What was I thinking going out getting drunk during the weekday? I'm getting too old for this. I get to work, feeling still drunk.  I should have called in sick. I send my boss a message.  "I'm not feeling so well"   I tried to go use the bathroom at work but it was so disgusting.  I wasn't going to puke at work bathroom or even thinking about hugging the toilet.  So I needed a plan! Good excuse to go home ASAP because I'm going to burst any minute. Me: I'm having a bad stomach ache:I think it's something I ate last night. Boss: You okay? Do you want me to go get you something from Walgreen? Me: (oh shit, she is going to help me out, quick! think of something drastic to say).  Umm I don't know, it's little personal thing you know. Boss:  Are you having cramps? Is it that time of the month?  Funny she makes jokes. Me:  hahaha, I'm laughing but I said no, I told her I have the D'word, (too embarrassed to say it) but I couldn't think of any other excuse.  I didn't want to tell her I drank too much last night and don't want to be lectured about "responsibility" Boss: okay go home, feel better. I take few magazines from work and put it in my bag to read over the weekend.  Tell my coworkers I'm leaving for the day. I told them I made up an excuse to our boss. Saying I had diarrhea.   Coworker:  GEORGE GOT DIARRHEA! Me: damn dude, no need to yell it out so loud so everyone can hear, I don't have diarrhea:I'm going to puke so I'm going home to do it. I need some bread, soup, anything. So I walk over to Cosi to get some bread and soup before I catch a cab to go home ASAP.  I hurry over and get a piece of free bread and start chewing on it quickly as I can than ordered chicken noodle soup to go.  I'm desperately trying to make this transaction quickly as possible and hurry to get in the cab.   Two ladies asking me bunch of questions about all sorts. I give them brief answers and walk outside to flag down a cab.  They follow me outside start talking to me again.  C'mon... cab!  (I'm really not in the mood to talk). I have a piece of bread in my mouth, holding the soup with my right hand, messenger bag on my shoulder, cellphone in my other hand.  These ladies keeps on talking to me, I don't have a free hand to open the cab door so I put doggy bag with soup inside my messenger bag (dumb ass, you know its going to spill) but I wasn't thinking straight okay?   I'm free from the ladies, I get in the cab. Going home finally.  I'm going to puke, dizzy, spinning. Told Mr. Cab driver to hurry! LaSalle and Maple! Okay, I'm home:damn soup did spill in my bag.  My ass is hot from the soup and I open up my bag. Holy shit, look like a fish tank with soup chunks floating everywhere.  Damn it, I don't have time for this. All the magazines are drenched:I throw my bag in the kitchen sink.  I head over to the bathroom.   I'm ready to puke now.  I hover around the toilet for 30 minutes. I don't need to puke any more, puke sensation is gone.   I had to deal with this entire ordeal for nothing?  I cleaned up my bag, dumped rest of the soup that didn't spill in to a bowl.  I ate it and went to sleep for next 8 hours.;4;2;2;5;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

There were a few problems I had with the place though- the drinks were very over priced (Im talkin $8 beers) and the place was overly packed toward the point I think they exceeded fire code. Also the DJ booth wasn't blocked off so people  constantly bumped the table causing the music to stop- very annoying.;3;2;2;1;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1328;10/14/2006;-FKHNwPkfGoNHANkkRioyw;DecNq9BYtMwHhgdnPNGbVQ;I came here for a private party which was a plus since we were able to get a table and they had free drinks.  It's a little odd that the free drink was Hypnotiq but hey, it tastes like Kool-Aid, so I couldn't complain about that.  The decor was cool, but I just know this is the kind of place I would never come on my own.  This is more the kind of place where I'd lurk around making snotty comments under my breath Ghost World style.;3;1;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

Decor is OK, and there is enough space to move around - but music is quite poor. Too many pretentious, gel hair guys. Second time I went there, we had the private room with our own DJ for a b-day party, and it was better. The private room is cozier, especially if you can get a group of ~30 people or so. Be careful with the table service, they might rip you off (paid $250 for one bottle of Absolut!). Overall, I don't enjoy this place much mainly because of 1)the crowd, 2)poor music.";2;1;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

1333;12/28/2006;aqxJ7TzgzrvGxqeSAVtl8A;9CD_dAzM3tzccuhg29DCKg;I seriously had higher expectations of this lounge. I had been hearing the buzz for a couple of years and I was actually VERY excited when I finally had the excuse to go there (by the request of an out of town friend). I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. Another Yelp! review was right on when they said that they want to like the place - I did, too. HOWEVER, there was no line outside when my friend and I arrived and despite how hot we looked (hehe), it was so annoying to have to stand in the cold while the dorks at the door stared at us for a couple of minutes to make it seem FAR more choosey than it actually is or deserves to be. The cover was ridiculous and the drinks were definitely nothing special (no Red Bull). I ran into a friend there who said the place is usually frequented by "D-Bags and the women who love them." Very true. I have never seen so many visible panty-lines and faux-ny tails in my life. There was only ONE very attractive boy that, of course, ALL of the VPL's were hovering around (and blocking my view - hehe), so I was pretty bummed. All in all, it was a night to tell stories about, but definitely not a night to make any attempt to experience a second time. Maybe I'm just not as cool as I thought. hehehehehe.;2;2;0;1;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ
1334;11/6/2006;R9wkVKbiTPt0pBAUwiJKCA;bNzgZCSKoQ6QaR0OYlj3nQ;Another Jerry Kleiner establishment in the Fulton Market District. I wasn't around for the days of Shelter, but I am told that Kleiner knew how to throw a party, and I must say that I can see what everyone is talking about. My first escapade to Victor occurred about a week after its opening. Of course, being the new club on the block, every model, B-list celeb, and athlete in town was sure to be checking out the spot, leaving the proletariat outside to wait in line for an hour (I must say once I got in I was impressed). I recently went back to Victor for the first time since then, and I like what I see. The interior remains the same, 1950's and 1960's mod furniture (Miesian Barcelona charis, some Le Corbusier, and the bubbly chair whose designer I don't recall), tasteful nude photography, and an overall very colorful atmosphere. What I really like about this place though is the focus on house music, which draws an intense following, particularly on Thursday nights. As with any place that has been open for a while, regular Friday or Saturday nights can be touch and go, so I would stick to special events. But overall, I would deem Victor Hotel to be a place that more Chicago nightclubs should aspire to--tasteful, sophisticated, experimental, and distinctive.;4;1;2;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

Yet, let's be real: this is a place for people who like to spend money. So if you are cheap- go elsewhere! If I'm in the mood to dress up and get pretty- I know Victor's the spot, but I know I'm gonna pay a little bit more for a beer or a glass of wine than at other places, It's just that kind of spot.

1337;5/13/2006;1pJ-YKzVwnSYanU8-vFvHQ;6CB0ToWUZphb6HbLV_hxkQ;I agree with Tobey.  First few weeks of going when it first opened the staff was friendlier.  The last two times the door guy was very cocky! Yes, you have the power mighty door guy!  Its not that serious of a lounge for the door guy to act like the secret service.  aside from this however, i still prefer this lounge over a club so if you want to hang out with a friend after dinner and not pay to get in, this is a nice place.  The sushi is pretty good and the bar tender that use to work at fulton lounge is swift on her feet.  never leaves you dry!  So overall, go there early, plenty of parking, no cover charge, the music is pretty good and you can have a decent conversation without going deaf...the price for a glass of wine is acceptable for the glass size and they do have very good wine selections....their mango rolls are very very good!  Also, I like that they take pictures of their guests for their website and they actually post them. unlike other places they edit their pictures.  I must add, short people be warned, this place attracts tall model like people, if you dont like to feel clusterphobic then dont stay too long, or you'll have drunk giant women stumbeling on you as they dance to lounge music.   (hee hee)  it is entertaining though... oh yeah, hurray for this place, no more frat boys!  well, we'll wait a couple more months, you'll be seeing them come in with their flip flops.;3;1;0;0;P0d8m5E67oBc0BpVUh4nKQ

While we didn't have much to look at, our room was absolutely perfect complete with a huge bathroom, (yes, the sliding door was annoying, and why do hotels refuse to install fans? It's a no-brainer when sharing!) small sitting area and two tvs. We would have surely paid triple the price to enjoy the same thing in NYC or Miami (newly opened) but not in good ol' Chicago. Pretty central location to dt:perfectly air conditioned. Wonderful bed with three types of pillows if you need them. Nice, clean, small gym perfect for working off the popcorn, steak, tacos, alcohol and all of that amazing food offered in Chicago. Steakhouse was pretty great as was the free drink upon arrival. Don't forget to read the free time out mag if you have time and if you need ideas. (but I'm sure you've arrived with many.) Extremely helpful hotel staff and probably the best maid service I've ever experienced. It always helps to leave at least a couple of dollars daily! Turndown service was an added bonus as was the little sweet treat that we'd save for the next day. Sb coffee was great if you don't feel like going down the street in the 100+ degree heat first thing in the am. Daily water refill was a bonus, as was the mini-bar fridge that we used--no questions asked. Great for yoghurt or leftovers! Door guys were helpful...just don't be caught carrying one of their umbrellas with you like we did for a couple of days. Because apparently, in Chicago, "you only believe it when you see it." How different from Vancouver! Honestly, if you can't afford the trip to NY, this is the place to go and this is the place to stay. You won't be disappointed!;5;8;9;9;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1339;7/10/2012;aEb6VCZTorqYUhCZ59awPQ;r1rd--8_lstWwCyQfN-Nhw;Boutique Wanna-be  - Horrible Air Conditioning - Not family friendly Small room.  Barn-like bathroom door impossible for my 11 year old to open.  NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.  No ice on the floor.  No vending machines.  Not even a closet!  Cheap Patio like table. Most irritating was the lack of adequate air conditioning.  Outside temps were in the low 90's but inside, the low 80's.  We moved rooms and found it equally uncomfortable.  Management and the service dude told us to keep the metal access door to the a/c closet open to help them along.  Didn't work, and the excess noise was ridiculous.  Really? A few times I went across the street to the Sheraton 4 Points lobby to cool down (and get a Coke) so don't tell me Hotel's in Chicago can't handle the heat. Uncomfortable and unacceptable.;1;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Breakfast, Lunch and breakout beverages were great! The location was perfect for getting to Michigan Avenue and walking around to see the sites! The team was amazed by how beautiful Chicago is!;4;5;4;4;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1341;8/10/2012;VzrefePKVDalbncxg7FGCw;thzd5GBIU0JqvNZ_mo2IVw;I stayed at the James a year and a half ago and LOVED it. Don't know if its just aged or if I had a better room last time, but this visit the place felt like it had aged ten years. Carpets in elevator, halls, and room feel dated and tired! Location is still superb and the overall vibe is good. Could not get spa to call me back to schedule a massage, which was also sad. Otherwise, location is good and it is a fine alternative to some of the other larger chain hotels.;3;0;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1342;5/14/2012;pK4LaySb0x2vz21kCU17pg;kAeqEOGvQyI6quLXv8y1hQ;I stayed at The James Hotel during a recent weekend trip to Chicago and loved everything about the hotel.  First, the location was perfect -- walking distance to almost everything or a short cab ride.  Second, service was excellent -- everyone from the bell hop at the door to the associate at the check in counter to the concierge was really friendly and helpful.  Third, I really liked the overall feel and decor of the hotel.  The room itself was small but clean, cozy and comfy. The furniture is modern and the bed was perfect.  The hotel also provides its own bottled filtered water in each of the rooms and free wifi throughout its premises. Note that they no longer provide Kheil's bathroom products.   I highly recommend The James Hotel and would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Chicago.;4;3;4;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1343;2/27/2012;KCOZvDi8DYtG;Pgkmk6K7NNi1t5eBec2GFw;I booked this hotel on a whim via jetsetter's flash sale event. As a pessimist, I always tell myself to expect nothing from those promotional stock photos. But once I got there, the greeting, the service, the chicness, etc, i find that this is where value meets quality at right in the middle. I loved the design and the "it is what it is, and its good" attitude. I also love their full-sized Intelligent Nutrients products in the bathroom. It makes me feel like i'm staying at a cool buddy's house instead of a stingy hotel. And cudos to their speedy wifi. many hotels offer free wifi, however, 80% of them are dial-up speeds. The James is an exception. The minibar and the "help yourself drawer" is another thoughtful thing they've done. from tequila to heneiken, from contact solution to chapstick.. if you weren't thoughtful enough to bring these essentials yourself and got too cozy to go downstairs, do help yourself. but I'm sure they'll charge you for anything you grab though. but that's fair enough. the bed is so comfyyyyy!! beware once you land yourself on that mattress you will not want to explore the city. but c'mon. the hotel is at the center of everything right off michigan ave. so exploring the city doesn't necessarily mean taking a long hike.;5;3;4;2;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1344;12/29/2011;nyXMn1H0okx0U0CBO-HIew;VR4tgETCtlS20aJgOwd0Jw;I will never stay here again. I've had better service at the best western. Where do I start... 1. Did not follow thru on a promotion running (stay 3 nights, get 1 free) even though we booked on time - we contacted the manager twice via email about adjusting our bill but never responded to us! Once they get your money at the time of reservations, forget about it after that. Their non refundable reservations are a bunch of BS! 2. Projection TV did not work 3. Toilet stopped working mid-stay 4. Maid service did not clean room one day -- arrived at 5pm after a day out on the town to find a dirty room. 5. Stained couches and filthy shag rug 6. My friend forgot a gift for her baby in the room, no one followed up with us about the forgotten gift. For a boutique and fashionable hotel, the service and follow through is horrible. Not worth your money at all! It was a horrible place to spend my birthday weekend in Chicago.;1;3;1;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1345;2/24/2012;qmuUlHLnseBfeCOT1nC7zg;lxLvaKzRcN-7gtxyywgRbA;I booked this hotel on a whim and had never been there before. I must say, quite the lucky strike! This hotel is amazing. From the doorman, to the reception, to the room, itself, this hotel has it all. The location is in downtown very close to everything you'll need: shopping, eating, or site-seeing. We had booked a queen-size room. The room size wasn't that large, but the cleanliness of the room and decor was what gave you the homely. yet contemporary feel. There is a mini-bar in the room along with a small sitting/study area. Whenever we needed anything, all we had to do was step outside the hotel and everything was in reach. The staff was very helpful and professional. Very clean, very quiet, and a great experience.;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1346;8/16/2012;JuleZ-4q-9Ky-jcJfE47pQ;dpKkBNCSrXgwgqqXd5JqOw;We managed to finally get a few days off, and after some browsing and checking other user reviews, we decided for the James. One of the main attraction is the location. It's perfectly central, 100m from Michigan av, and a few mn away from some excellent places to have dinner, or even breakfast/brunch/lunch. Central location means also easy access to most attractions in Chicago. So going back to food, we took advice most times from the concierge, who each time gave us an excellent address depending on what we wanted to eat. The bedroom itself is very good. It took us a bit of time to get use to the switches for the lights which were not always located at the right spot. Also wifi was very very slow. But for the rest it was as needed. Comfortable bed, small bathroom with all amenities (and good quality soaps etc.), and when coming back in the evening late, there was always a little cookie on the bed to welcome us :-);5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1347;6/14/2012;AdUbXUS2IOxCLts;SJBuybhQKtEgeEpl1TcgHA;I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.  The staff is great, the rooms were spacious and really cool, and the food / bar are outstanding.  The details in the decoration and food presentation make this place really stand out.  Chic and modern while also cozy and welcoming, the decor is really to die for.  Finally, the music played in the lobby and in restaurant was really nice.  The people here really try to make you feel welcome, and they obviously take a lot of pride in their work.  Overall just a really fabulous hotel.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1348;2/13/2012;76NYN3P2LXYRk049ZEvuNQ;CeXpJN3oukmrN8wn4-J2EA;Oh yeah. Now THIS is a hotel.  I will dream about The James until I have another chance to stay there.  My husband and I stayed here when we decided, rather randomly, to hitch a flight out to Chicago that weekend.  It was Thursday, we booked to arrive Friday.   When we arrived and through the whole stay, the staff was friendly, courteous, professional, just fantastic.  The room was clean and gorgeous.  The bed was absolutely the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.  The bathroom, so pretty!   There was a turn-down service that came in after we had left the room both evenings, turned down the sheets, emptied trash, filled our ice bucket with ice and put delicious little cookies on the pillows.  We called them our "Room Ninjas". The concierge was incredible.  He helped us track down the location of a club that didn't seem to be listed in the phone book or online.  He made several phone calls and within just a few minutes he had the address and a cab waiting.   I'm not sure if the bar in the lobby is more affiliated with Primehouse (the restaurant on site, FANTASTIC as well) but I had the best mojito I have ever had in my life in the lobby of The James.  I will never forget that, as I am a total Mojito nazi. Our ONLY complaint about the stay is that the room was incredibly hot, and we had to call to have a fan brought up when we woke up sweating at 4 am.  Otherwise, this was just a perfect stay.  We were treated like royalty, which made us tip like royalty.   I would go back in a heartbeat.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1349;7/12/2011;lvjfQYj-itChX6KeSPPujg;b_ED_rPl7OLwEpUlr4VI5A;The James Hotel treated us like money even if we're more like pesos.  From the time we entered the door until the time we checked out, everything about the place was first class.  They helped us celebrate our nine-year anniversary by upgrading our stay to a suite.  They also completely covered the room in rose petals and had a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries waiting for us as we entered the room. The hotel's location is great as you're within walking distance to most of the touristy areas in the City and only a block or two away from the red line.  It's a perfect hotel in a perfect location and I'm glad I found the hotel on Yelp before I made a reservation at one of those corporate hotels that don't pay attention to the details.  When I travel I want to feel taken care of and this place did its best to make us feel like we home away from home. This place is so money, it makes me want to party.;5;16;15;15;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1350;1/23/2012;FJCskpD3B9YJAv88wQjpJw;B6MGEHG5yPTvKp1Pofk_Og;My wife and I stayed at the James hotel to celebrate our anniversary.  All the hype is true.  The service was phenomenal, the hotel room was beautiful, the view was magnificent, and the room service was delicious. I arranged ahead of time for my wife to receive an in-room deep tissue massage from an on-site massage therapist.  The massage therapist arrived on time, was incredibly personable and polite, and had my wife glowing by the end of the massage.  This was an excellent point-earner. My wife and I are also a bit crazy when it comes to room temperature.  We like it cold.  So when we got into the room and it was at 72*F we were a bit uncomfortable.  But you get complete control of the temperature.  We were able to put on the air conditioning in the middle of January and get it to the 65*F we like.  We were tickled. I have seen in many of the reviews that everyone raves about the beds.  If you were reading this review to hear otherwise, you are out of luck.  My wife and I have a terrible time sleeping in any bed besides our own, but after a long day of shopping and shows, we fell asleep quickly and easily.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable and comforter soft and warm.  I have never slept in another unfamiliar bed so easily. The room was cleaned twice a day as well.  This was an excellent treat.  We would leave to go shopping and come back to an immaculate room once again. Finally, there is a Trader Joe's right across the street.  So if you ever feel the need to get groceries it could not be more convenient. All in all it was a majestic stay.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1351;12/28/2011;SfEtSFoLXYNAkjyoH2b6-w;3kEC5LAFLMC03tfUqAeShw;Me? An A-list celeb? That's how I felt when I stayed at the James. From the doorman greeting you to finding a cookie on your bed, these small details make you feel special and at home. The hotel is small but has everything you need, including a great location only steps away from terrific restaurants and excellent shopping on Michigan Av. As for the accommodations, my room included a king size bed, a bar, living room area, 2 flat screen tvs, 2 iPod stations/radios, and a gorgeous bathroom. The James strikes a unique balance between modern function and artsy aesthetic that made my stay feel unique and personal. It's a great choice for business travel, a romantic getaway, or a weekend to explore the city.;5;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1352;7/20/2011;ah8FGd69JERcsirBQdvy2g;kwLjniiYa1H57LwQX2TGIQ;Great hotel to use as home base if you're in Chicago.   The nightly rate is very reasonable and the hotel and rooms are very modern.  I just hate the stuffy, cookie cutter look of the chains.  Service is excellent and there is free WiFi. 4 stars instead of 5 because the fee to park a car is exorbitant ($48.00).   That is just crazy! Also, though I enjoyed the hotel, my bed honestly wasn't very comfortable.  I didn't sleep well the whole trip - but I wasn't really in Chicago to sleep.  The bathroom door is a sliding door and there is no soundproofing so there can be some awkward moments if someone is in the room with you... Overall a great, centrally located hotel.   I will return.;4;1;1;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1353;8/24/2011;wf4AKfO233A3zs6ICNNelg;XBNtqhc72X57VK8GLNbsGg;Love the James!  The rooms are spacious, the beds are so comfy, and I thought the design touches (like all the lights are on dimmers) make the rooms feel pretty special.  My room was on the top floor and at the end of the hall, so it was very quiet.  I was able to check in (very) early, 11 am, which was great.  Check out time is quite late, 2 pm, which was also great. Turndown service was unexpected and such a nice surprise!  I had heard that there were Khiels toiletries, but there weren't... oh well.  The room was very clean, and the service from everyone was great. I got a pretty low rate ($137) by booking through an Expedia blind deal.  This is the main reason why I am giving 5 stars, because for that price I really doubt you can find anything better. There's a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's right across the street.  Great location in general.  There are many self-park garages very very close by too if you don't want to pay for valet (although I'm not sure how much money you'd be saving...);5;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1354;6/26/2011;gd1zHFxAgHEIi;R5ceOfHDF_W1Zg1SO6vlkA;Ok 1st things 1st.  the location is hard to beat.  1 block from michigan ave is awesome!  the lobby is small but hip, so thats ok.  the room amenities are pretty BA.  robes for each person and slippers is a great touch.  the wet bar is top notch, and also top notch pricey.  luckily there is a trader joes across the street and they sell pretty good beer/wine.   our 1 and only issues was the street noise.  we were originally on the 4th floor facing the street.  the windows are not the double pane variety, so any noise on the street is very noticeable.  my wife and i could not sleep the first night, so we called down and asked to have  the room changed.  they changed us that night., but we had to switch to two doubles.  they said they would switch us back to a king the next day, but that didnt happen.  for the amount we paid for the room i was expecting alot better service and a sound nights sleep another weird thing was they didnt have any ice machines.  so if u wanted ice, u needed to call the front desk and ask for someone to bring it up.  now in the middle of the day, thats fine, but during prime time, we waited an hour for ice, which is unacceptable.  overall, it was a cute hotel, but i wont stay there again.;2;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1355;6/2/2011;mlQ5cl8ixMwjjKonnOoC0g;AcD8O5btWI7qfQN4J54OKQ;I booked The James Hotel through Expedia for a great deal. It really did live up to all the reviews. This was our first visit to Chicago so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Location: This hotel is close to so much. We were a few blocks from the train that we used to go to Wrigley & the airport. We were able to walk to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Grant Park, and the beaches. There were shops, and restaurant galore all around us. It was raining the one day, so the complimentary car service took us to our brunch destination. That was very nice and so much better than a cab ride. Also, there is a Trader Joe's across the street where you can get some wine & beer,water, and snacks, rather than using the very expensive mini bar in your room. Staff: The concierges, doormen, front staff, and housekeeping were all extremely nice, helpful, and professional. We were greeted at our arrival by wishing us a Happy Anniversary. The evening of celebrating our anniversary they even had complimentary desert waiting for us in our room! It was something small but so very thoughtful and made us happy. The Rooms: We spent a good portion of time in our room for some pre-dinner drinks and TV watching in the morning. We never felt confined. We just had the basic King Room. The room is spacious and the beds are super comfortable. Even the bathroom had plenty of room to get ready and spread all my stuff out. The rooms are cleaned twice a day(turn down service at night, with a treat). It was so nice to come back after a night out, and have the room clean again. We also went to the gym daily, which was very clean and more than enough machines. Fresh water, towels, and even oranges were available for your workout. My husband and I loved Chicago and had one of our best vacations. It definitely started with The James and would return if and when we make it back to Chi Town.;5;0;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1356;3/9/2011;9DAI0queIC6T-iTGIRtadQ;DR9AOS0QHM3TTQwisK2WXg;Do you enjoy being pampered, unbridled 5-star luxury, and prefer service being served with a smile? If you answered YES to any of the above, then The James is the place for you. This past weekend I spent my 23rd birthday in Chicago. After scouring the 'net for hotel deals (for some reason people avoid traveling to areas where it snows in the winter--being from Texas, I relish it), I came across The James at $139/night through http://Travelzoo.com. Alone this would be a total steal (rooms generally run ~$250/night), and ON TOP of that a $100 food/beverage voucher was included for use at either David Burke's Primehouse, their in-house bar/lounge JBar, or In-Room Dining (more on that later). A separate spiel must be made for their concierge service/staff. A week or so before arriving I had e-mail correspondence with Daisy (such a pleasure to communicate with), to have "The Anniversary" amenity (a bottle of champagne along with these delicious bite-size brownie morsels topped with raspberries) awaiting my guest and I in our room before arrival. However, when we arrived--the amenity was not in our room. Not a big deal, I called down and they had someone send it up in under 5 minutes. But, the little card to accompany the surprise was not included. Again, no big deal. Thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the next day, my actual birthday. My guest and I hit the town for the majority of the day, returning early evening. Upon entry, I notice the card from yesterday WITH a plate of cookies (how thoughtful, I say to myself). THEN, I turn the corner to find a plate of birthday cupcakes with my OWN card signed by the entire concierge staff? Yes indeed, the sweetness overrunneth. FINALLY, as my guest and I sit down to enjoy piping hot Giordano's (the best in the city)--there's a knock at the door. It's Mirna the head concierge to apologize for forgetting the card yesterday and for the delayed delivery of the champagne with a tray of breadsticks and ice-cold beer !!! How did they know this would be the perfect addition to our meal?!? I have no idea, I just know I love them for it. Other Pros: Kiehl's bath products. Luxurious. Nightly turn-down service. Stayed two nights, two different cookies on my pillow. Room Service. See below After spending a few bucks at JBar before hitting the town the night before, we still had the majority of our food/beverage voucher to use the next morning before checkout. We. Went. Crazy. James Omelette for me (tri-tip steak, mushrooms, truffle oil, asiago cheese), Belgian Waffle for my guest. Hashbrowns, ham, juice, milk, & coffee to share. In a word? Delicious. Best room service I've ever eaten. They serve 24-hours a day too, including an enticing "late-night" menu which I'm surprised my guest and I didn't take advantage of--I think we passed out on the 300-thread count sheets before we picked up the phone. Cons? That I had to leave. You'll be seeing me again soon, James. Thanks for everything, you were the perfect start to a new birth year.;5;1;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1357;7/12/2011;6ncEc6QtibwvkCRQVVaLoA;a0m4D5xU_MegRf0mQDBevg;Stayed over Memorial weekend of 2011 for 4 nights and had an amazing experience! First off, the hotel is gorgeous! Loved loved loved the feeling, the design and the BEDDING! Sometimes I didn't want to leave the bed! The location was also perfect. It was so central to everything, we were able to walk everywhere with ease. Thanks to the other Yelp reviews for making sure we booked at the James. The cleaning staff was amazing. After a long day of touristy stuff with my partner we'd always come back to a clean room! The room was the perfect size for two people and we even had a gorgeous view! The staff was always accommodating, setting us up on tours, recommending which place to go and always hailing a cab for us! The rate of the hotel was actually pretty decent. Plus, FREE WiFi! Loved the James Hotel and will most definitely be back!;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1358;5/9/2009;7cc4H;FGgO5DwGK3Gq7_wZRuvkwQ;The James is an impossible boyfriend. Good-looking, smart, socially-conscious, cultured and playful. If he were a person, I'd imagine The James to kill in a suit, and dazzle just as well wearing nothing at all. Not to out-do you, but rather to elevate you. That's The James. You. Elevated. And from the start too. No coyness, no incessant wishing and hoping and waiting. He's straightforward. From the time you make reservations, concessions are made, no details are spared. It's courtship from the get-go. I'm still considered new to the city, having moved back only in October 2008. So I get to do all the touristy things and do them with glee. It's true. No sighing or eye-rolling here. I relish it all and challenge stereotypes. For my husband's birthday this year, everything seemed trite. He has enough Ben Sherman to start a boutique (though I did get him a wonderful black nylon jacket: http://tinyurl.com/qnc73p. More for me than for him, ya dig?? :-), he wants flying lessons to renew the pilot's license but we aren't yet independently wealthy. . . sad, right? So I called Jackie. I didn't know her name then, but we're emailing now. Trying to set up a lunch date too. She wants to volunteer with us. No, I don't need any more friends, but this is just how it is at The James. You fall in love with everyone. She got to know me, understood being a local but wanting to experience this great city like you just flew in for the night. And she treated us right. The James doesn't have to do much to impress, but it works as hard as it would if it were a Howard Johnson. Of course, the lobby dazzles and yes, the dog biscuits and bowl of water out front is charming but everyone is so damn nice. Ready, willing and able to do anything. Our room was crisp and modern and homey all at once. Again, the perfect boyfriend knew you were coming. Six mini-cupcakes were waiting on a tray with a note encouraging a call if we were wanton for more. The bed was tucked tight and taut, as if you'd be the first to bounce on the mattress. It said just enough about him, but not enough that the mystery wouldn't last for years. And the furniture and art work were West Elm. . . elevated. Like he invented the concept of boutique "Luxury Liberated", as they call it. And he probably did. Because he's perfect.;5;11;14;14;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1359;4/21/2011;O9Z87BsuM3Qp3wu8IMLVkw;RU50ptl9Oy5IGXRvxYVhRg;I appreciate attention to detail (ATD) so much that it's all I can think of when I stay at a hotel. I could care less about the amenities, but if they do pay attention to details, they win over me. The gym: it's gorgeous for a hotel gym. It has almost all the machines/equipment that you would need or could think of. It's clean and well-maintained. There are jars of ice-cold fruit-infused water with to keep you hydrated, and they get replenished frequently. They even provide you with wrapped earphones in case you forget to bring yours. Now, THAT is ATD. Instead of the traditional folio for your card keys, they have a mock-leather card wallet which includes a card-size street map. Very cute. ATD again. The room was clean, so very clean--spotless and odor-less. It's sort of ATD. I love that they don't have any bed spreads. They are gross and I hate them. Yay, I could just dive right into the bed without pulling it off first. Now, for the nitpicking items: I would've liked that the cute little "dining nook" (as they called it) would have some lighting in there for laptop or reading activities. Concierge, eh, that, we could live without. We felt that he was more about pushing his list onto us, rather than listening to us the sort of activities we'd love to do. Tips: We asked for higher floors and I was glad. We didn't have a view of the mile or downtown but it was bright and open. There were TONS of alcohol in the room:it was definitely a mega bar. I kid you not.;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1360;9/30/2007;yAG5gMmrNRxFDUaiRjvi3w;rQrqrb5dFztAeFYwyqbygA;We stayed at the James over the weekend, and I was definitely impressed. What I didn't like about the hotel was made up for in the impeccable service of this boutique hotel. Decor: I'm not a fan of the red.  It SCREAMS tacky.  It's the type of place with hip electronic music playing in the background and then you see a group of 30-40 year old bachelors with ripped designer jeans, half unbuttoned shirts, man jewelry and enough cologne to start a fire (when they light their cigarette). I guess a little red is okay, but to put a large patent pleather red chaise lounge in a room with four white walls is just wrong. What were you thinking??? The bed was very nice.  Very large and plush with soft sheets and down comforter.  Perfect for lounging around or having a lazy Sunday morning.  I liked the large wooden bench for setting your luggage and the nook for reading, working or eating was very nice (but not that comfortable).   Bathroom is very large, but houses the closet (weird).  Shallow tub reminds me of my own apartment.   Service and amenities: Love the cookies for turn down service!  Also love the martini glasses, large assortment of full bottles of liquer in room (Tanqueray, Grey Goose, Johnny Walker Black and Petron) with martini shaker, and Kiehls bath products.  (I LOVE Kiehls!!).  Free wifi is always great too! Full sized gym is awesome.  Clean, empty with a variety of cardio and weight equipment.  Complimentary large bottles of SmartWater in the elevator area too! A couple of things that were lacking, ok just one.  No Newspaper!!!   Dog and cat friendly too! I enjoyed my stay, but the Peninsula is more my type of place :);4;6;3;4;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1361;8/19/2009;402EEAN7fwoEIg04LPahTg;ULK94n8lgBIG0_F1aIYhvQ;Really enjoyed my stay at the James Hotel.  I don't usually stay at hip modern décor spots, but the beds were comfortable and the shower had a nice stream of hot water and the rooms were spacious enough and that's really what I care about.  I'd like to tell you about the cookies, but my roommate ate them all. It is right in the heart of tourist stuff, which might not be hip, but I was a tourist so it worked out for me.   Was able to walk to one of the many walking tours that Frommers has on their website.  Right there, did you read that, that was probably the most important part of the review.  Whenever you visit a city, check out Frommers' walking tours (or some similar travel site, most of 'em have them).  They're great.  And if you stay at the James, they don't charge you to use the business center, so if you go to Chicago and stay at the James, you don't even have to do any preplanning to arrive, unless you plan on doing the architecture boat tour, which sells out. Anyhoo, my only complaint is that the elevators are slow.  Too many floors and too many people.  Time to get one of those fancy elevators where you tell the elevator which floor you're going to before you enter into the elevator. I've only been on 2 of those types of elevators and now that I've been on them, I think any new building is flawed if they don't have them.  I'm getting tired of stopping at every floor, that I'll either stay on the lower floors or will act like the woman on the southwest commercial and hit the door close button as people approach. That's not actually true, but I've felt like doing that. The most important thing to know though is that the most important celebrity to Yelp fans stayed here.  Yes, I ran into Fabio in the lobby of the hotel.  Yes the same Fabio who sadly was stuck working with Michael Chiarello. If you're not a fan of Fabio than you're probably should not be reading yelp. And that is the most rambling review I've ever posted.  Time to quit.;4;4;4;6;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1362;9/16/2010;mJrBqVEDagmcodagO3wOlg;oCYxjlqjpnW5WJAo6HNR0A;I have traveled to Chicago for business many times, and, while I had often wanted to stay at The James Hotel, it had yet to happen.  So, on a recent personal vacation, I finally followed through with a reservation.  The hotel was perfectly located in the heart of the River North area, only a few blocks from The Magnificent Mile and Lake Michigan.   From the moment we arrived until the moment we checked out, we received top-notch, friendly service.  Each coming or going was punctuated by a greeting from the door staff.  In addition, the concierge was thorough and knowledgeable.  The baggage checking department was also extremely quick and efficient.   The hotel offered a relaxing lobby with several couches and even a work station with various computers.  The hotel's gym was massive, with tons of weight machines and cardiovascular equipment.  Complimentary headphones and citrus-enhanced water were additional pleasant touches. Though we did not eat at the Primehouse restaurant, we did grab a soda in the bar and were impressed by the beautiful decor.  In addition, on our first late night out on the town, we found our way to their semi-hidden bar and lounge that served up custom cocktails in a dimly lit, skillfully soundtracked venue. Our room was just as stellar as the hotel amenities.  For starters, it was very spacious, especially for a city-based hotel.  The decor was sleek and minimalistic with the majority of the furnishings being white.  The room came equipped with a large flat-screen TV, a cozy reading nook, mini bar snacks, and a complete bar set with full-sized liquor bottles.  The bathroom was oddly equipped with a sliding door, the handle of which happened to fall off into my friend's arms on day one.  Regardless, the space was extremely large and offered Kiehl's products, as well as a convenient closet for storing personal toiletries.   Though I have loved the majority of my hotel stays in Chicago, The James had surpassed all of my previous experiences, both in the Windy City and abroad.  The flawless service, spotless room, comprehensive amenities, and beneficial location made this hotel a complete package for any traveler.;5;6;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1364;10/18/2006;VhzeJhtl9tUuBHVjqagNcQ;89yr7wNIk8TE03yKfTRLuQ;Fun hotel, lots of modern furniture, compact, bright, and comfortable. Having David Burke's Primehouse on the bottom floor, with its clubby bar and NY steakhouse feel is a plus. If your company is too cheap to spring for an offsite, try one here in one of their suites. Catering is good too! Haven't stayed here, just attended a meeting, so the four stars does not reflect the quality of the bed.;4;3;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1365;4/17/2010;fU5h5fKMdrXy0CcDIQ;Ic1OzOQGdvieR2d0sptxFw;Lots of bad notes about this hotel: - The door wall and the bathroom walls are very thin. If your neighbor takes a shower, it's going to be deafening in your room. If the cleaning service is in the hallway talking you're going to be able to catch their entire conversation. - On the rear (south) facing rooms,  you might be awoken from slumber for 1 HOUR of trash removal. They seem to queue up dumpsters (about 20) in the alley behind the hotel. The trash day seems to be monday. - For a business hotel the Wifi is horrible. Like 20 kbs/s horrible at times (that's dial-up speed). I suspect that this is because of the volume of people this weekend, and i'll let this segway into... - LUKEWARM SHOWERS. I hate capitalize, but this seems outrageous for such a well rated, expensive hotel. - Clogged showers. My shower wouldn't drain properly... they sent a repairman up who promptly removed a large wad of hair from the drain. The service was great, but I feel that this is something that should be tested between occupants. To end on a positive note: The service was excellent, their staff was friendly and well equipped to handle most problems you might encounter while traveling. I had them fedex home some liquids I bought that wouldn't have made it through security.;2;3;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1366;10/10/2008;glRlCGiLVXVnKO2RTDD0RA;L4CXCKMj2NDsr8fd2_XmkA;I've stayed here twice.  First, my fiance (at the time) decided to celebrate our "half way through our engagement aka half way of living like a college student because weddings cost a small fortune" weekend.  We stayed at the James for free as part of a promo package for Gen Art.  It was wonderful!  We both had a fantastic time. 5 months later, my lovely bridesmaids decide to rent a double room for my bachelorette party!  It was SO MUCH FUN.   Before the festivities began, I hung out with my 3 maids in the room and we all got ready together.  Then, the rest of the girls arrived for a private shower.  Since there were only a dozen girls, we were comfy.  I wouldn't put any more in the room though- they are a little right. Do you know why I know that my bridesmaids love me? They let me take the Kiehl's tolietry samples home.;5;2;2;2;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1367;11/19/2009;jDOeYLYzNxBQKUOLrh9aqQ;YR7atQMrq-7d_JyLY-WI6Q;Boutique-y feel with the big chain level service, the James was a dream. Having booking through a hotel club website, we got upgraded to a suite, and the syite had what we called "a champagne room" WITH A PROJECTOR! seriously. I mean the welcome basket was cool and all, the bed was oooooh so comfy, but there was a champagne room with a projector. It's bathroom was luxe and bright, lovely and spot-on (but no Ace Hotel clawfoot tub confection, alas).;5;2;2;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1368;3/1/2010;PH3jgM3OcwEUHhp274c5MA;9Lh5wLp5QwMiqTVegDMhKA;Forget yoga class. If you want to relax without breaking a sweat, book a room at The James. OK, so yoga is a bit easier on the wallet than a stay at this hotel, but I was relaxed as soon as I walked into our room. The employees are friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, and the location is perfect. There's a spa conveniently located in the hotel, but if you want to save some money the great Kiehl's bath products, rainfall showerhead, and comfy robe and slippers will do just fine. Also, skip the pricey in-room pantry and bar items - Trader Joe's is right across the street. If you feel like getting out and exploring the city or want to cruise down the lake shore path, the hotel offers complimentary Paul Frank bicycles for guests. But, trust me, you will not want to leave the comfort of this hotel.;5;3;2;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1369;11/19/2008;mXPn3mpUcrIkZPW6KfbsAQ;B3GVHNj4UM8Rea7KGxiwtQ;My choice hotel in Chicago.  Even though my Chicago office is technically in Evanston, I'd always rather stay here and commute out in the morning. One of the best hotel-gym-gyms I've ever used.  That is, when it's too cold to run along the lake (and, trust me, it's often too cold for San Francisco me to run along the lake in wind-blown Chicago).  Good service.  Yummy food.  Nice sized room.  No wires (yea!).  No silly desk that I am never going to use because I always sit on the couch or tap away on my keyboard from bed while watching one of my two flat-screen tvs.  Whole Foods is nearby when I don't want to eat out and I am on city 3 in 3 days and need a little more interaction than the room service guy.;4;2;1;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1370;4/27/2009;nRJuJ-HkNzB2IwgP3rpbHw;FeduYB5KlxTCpyTOdXP8Hw;We held our wedding here on 1/24/09.... PENTHOUSE -  I stayed here with my girlfriends the Friday night before the wedding, they allowed us to check in very early and we transported all of my stuff there at that time, we had just come from having a mani/pedi party at a salon by my house and so we relaxed and watched TV and hung out. All of us girls got ready in the HUGEmarble bathroom for the rehearsal dinner. The room was wired for an ipod and had surround sound speakers in every room so we blasted music and proceeded to drink champagne. I highly recommend booking this room even if you are not holding your wedding at The James, it had a separate living room, dining room and bedroom, the bathroom was HUGE and I never once felt cramped with all my girls, mothers, etc in there. This was where we all got ready the day of and where my husband and I stayed after the wedding, they allowed us a 4:00pm check out on Sunday. CEREMONY: We held our Ceremony at The James in a Chevron round (I think that is what they call it) basically it was a semi circle around the chuppah. We loved it because all of our guests were right up close to us. The James's lighting was great and included in the price so I think that was a added benefit. FOOD/RECEPTION: This was one of the main reasons we booked The James Hotel. My Husband wanted David Burke to cater the meal. We had Lobster bisque with a crab roll to start, then salad, then an option of Chicken or a HUGE filet mignon, then we had wedding cake and their famous Cheesecake Lollipops for the table. It was amazing. The cocktail hour appetizers were amazing and people are still raving about the food. It is not a typical wedding meal it is treated and served like a fine dining experience. The only down side to that is that our dinning portion of the evening lasted almost 2 hours and cut into dancing. Once we realized how long it was taking we asked for the service to be sped up and they did. A++ for the food. This is not hit or miss, it is a sure thing. AFTER PARTY/THE JAMES CLUB: We had mini kobe beef cheeseburgers and truffle fries brought into the James Club which is a room off the Great room with a pool table, flat screens, and a bar. We also paid for an hour or two of extra open bar for our guests. We hooked up an ipod and were good to go. This was a great idea and everyone loved it. We actually got more time to visit with out of town guests during this part of the night.;5;2;2;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Room was super modern and cool, he loved it.  The only problem was that the heat could be turned off!  We had to open the windows and put the ac on!!!!  I should have called down and had them check on it, but was too tired...we muddled through.  told mgmt about ii in the morning and they were very nice and apologetic, I should have called!!!;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1373;9/6/2010;6iXh6EKVRZD2K-7QRDutyw;joErQbh-kEgdD26HmVg8uA;Stayed here with friends over the weekend and was very pleased with the location and attentive staff. The rooms were a pretty good size, but despite being on the 9th floor, there was a lot of exterior noise. The only complaint about the room is that is really isn't designed to be shared (especially by 2 women): the bathroom is long and narrow with limited counter space and no lighting or outlets by the full-length mirror and no mirror at all in the bedroom, which makes concurrent getting ready very difficult. They have a nightly turn-down service and give you a little treat from the restaurant downstairs (e.g. a small cookie), which is a nice touch. Valet parking is very expensive ($48/day), but it does give you in & out privileges. The concierge was very helpful when we asked for bar/club recommendations and gave us front-of-the-line/no cover passes for our entire group to some near-by trendy places (think the cover at one of those places was actually like $20, so definitely worth asking for!).;4;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1374;1/31/2008;4Ab7NHtHJeYxajSYihEWDQ;Hb30o1X8nfJ7u3OTsC5TPA;Perfection. This place was cool, calm and a great way to spend a three day weekend. My travel partner and I are crazy enough to go to the Windy City in January, so we got a kickn' deal too. The bathroom in our room was gigantic and there was even a little couch/table area which, considering the vibe of the hotel, I renamed "The Nook-ie". If you get a chance to stay here, you'll feel very swank.;4;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

We arrived to rose petals everywhere including the shower, champagne and strawberries. It was VERY sexy! Checking in was incredibly fast, as was checking out. We felt like this hotel went above and beyond our expectations. The bed was FABULOUS and we are thinking of buying one with our wedding money:) I also didn't want to part with the deluxe robes, sheets or towels. If you are into any of the guest room amenities - you will LOVE the products they use and i hope you appreciate the linens as much as I did.

The drinks and appetizers being served at the party were incredible! The "steak and egg" was a light egg mousse topped with little pieces of steak, all presented inside an egg shell... ooh la la. Also served were these tasty, tasty pate de fruit and mini sundaes.  I'm sure everything seemed about 50% more fascinating because I was drunk off of free booze but I'm sticking to my recommendation.;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

The only disappointment, my martinee sucked =-( , I didn'e even finish it.  My favorite martinis are prepared at Wildfire.  If my martini would of been good, I probably would of departed tipsy, "not drunk".  =-) We partook in a porterhouse steak, garden salad, twice baked potatoes, tempura green beans and I had the crabcake with a pretzel crust.  Our server suggested the tempura green beans, but they sucked in our opinion:everything else was eclectically prepared and delicious. I wanted to try the red velvet cake but it wasn't sold by the slice and I didn't want my hubby wasting $24 for a "cake in the pan" and then me not liking it.  Thus, on the house, our server presented me with a fancy slice of chocolate cake with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate.  Thank you. It was a unique, celebratory dinner experience at The James Hotel. And to think, I had never heard of The James Hotel.  This place is a gem, and the restroom was unique also, magnificent.;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1381;10/19/2011;tvHl;3bgdik-q-76Gi10oUT4Neg;First, the service at this hotel is superb. Friendly, helpful, and always accountable. I loved it. The hotel itself I think is a renovated office building and they did a great job attending to all of the details that come along with a renovation. The gym does not feel like its in a basement. I love the mini bar with great selections at decent sizes and prices too. Don't forget the travel sex toys! The alarm clock has an ipod dock that pops out that most people don't notice. All in all, great location, service and clean! Free wifi which is becoming standard nowadays. I was on the 15th floor and did not have much of a view but no complaints.

(1) the pictures behind the bed was missing one (of the two) (2) it looked as though there was supposed to be 6 pictures under the TV (all missing) Personally, when you are paying $250+/night for CHICAGO you think you would get all the fixtures...The rest of the room was ok, very clean. Bed was nice, and big enough for 2 or three The only other complaint I had was, our room didn't have a comfy foot rest for the "red leather deco-chair"... I really could have used that to prop our feet up- guess we should have gotten the room next door!;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Everything was beautifully appointed, the bed was fantastic, and the TV was huge too. I'd say it compares to the Mercer in New York, except for 1/4 of the price and without the pretense. The James is the best boutique hotel in Chicago, and if you can stay there for less than $150 as I did, you'll feel that you got a great deal.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1387;2/24/2010;-7JLd3rdNkBwkU7nvv3cpw;cUkf_ICJZ99r1NA4cmYYxw;I stayed at The James for the first time earlier this year.  I booked a room through a promotion where rooms were $125 and we received $100 in food credits!  I was expecting the hotel to be a bit budget to provide such a crazy deal but was very pleasantly surprised.   I travel about 1-2 weeks a month and am always looking for well-designed and comfortable hotels.  Basically I look for hotels that don't remind me I am on the road!  I was impressed with the overall service of The James, cleanliness of the rooms, comfort of the bed, Kiehl's products (yay!), deliciousness of food (Prime is a great steak house, the room service menu comes from Prime as well) and location. I went back to The James for a second time (this time not on the promotion)  to see if the first experience was just a fluke - but it wasn't!  They have a large gym with many cardio equipment options and a fantastic spa.  Dawn is a great masseuse.  I also love the access to printers and an easy and open business "center". Both my trips have been for business and I look forward to going back to Chicago and staying at The James again.  I see they are opening a hotel in NY as well....;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1389;10/22/2009;sN8xuXa8Bn7T6ZIfTk3aFw;M13W3naAvdQH_KWoSgwL_A;I have to agree with a few posters here: I can't imagine ever staying at another hotel in Chicago after my stay at to The James. Here, let me give you an example that sums up pretty well the kind of service you're going to get: after checking in at the front desk, my girlfriend and I made our way to the 9th floor (oh yeah, we got upgraded for taking a room on the "smoking floor," even though you would never have known someone smoked in our room). We passed our floor's housekeeping lady, who greeted us with a massive smile and a sweet hello. We get to our door, but our room keys don't seem to be taking in the card slot. I try one or two more times, and then the housekeeping lady (let's just call her Maggie, for no reason whatsoever) comes over to see what's up. We tell her our card isn't working and she replies, "Hold on, I'll get someone." She then proceeds to SPRINT DOWN THE HALLWAY to get help. Within 30 seconds, there are two James employees helping us, and we're in. After seeing Maggie sprint down that hallway, I knew this was going to be better than any hotel I'd ever stayed in... and it was, by miles. The rooms were so clean, I was shocked. It looked brand new, and far cleaner than my own home. I can almost guarantee you no one had ever smoked in there:I've stayed in smoking rooms before, and there's usually at least ONE burn, either in the carpet, the couch, the bed, the windowsill, on the bathtub. Nothing. Our bed was massive, comfy and spotless, with crisp white sheets and the most comfortable pillow top mattress I've ever slept on. The bathrooms? Spotless. Big, thick towels. Warm, breathable robes. Kiehls bath products (never thought I'd care, but this stuff is gooood) refilled whenever needed. Great water pressure for the shower, too. The lights? All dimmable, save for the lamp in your room's breakfast nook. Oh yeah, free wireless Internet. A fully stocked bar, including a mini fridge (we bought our own beverages across the street at Trader Joe's). What else? How about The Primehouse, attached in the lobby (it's also the main source for room service... try the steak omelet, delivered with a New York Times and a pot of incredible Primehouse coffee, right to your door in the morning!). Print out your boarding passes in the little office center in the lobby. Get some great tips from the concierge, or visit the James' site for their restaurant, shopping and other recommendations. I heard about Graham Elliot from their site and it wound up being one of the best meals of my life! Not one time during our entire stay did housekeeping accidentally walk in, or even knock to see if they could come in and clean. Nope, we'd just go out for a stroll or a quick brunch and by the time we returned, Maggie had already worked her magic. Oh, and if you leave for a few hours in the evening, expect to come home with your bed turned down, your robe laying out for you, with a couple of complimentary cookies from the Primehouse as a bedtime snack. The ginger snaps are especially yummy. James hotel, you've ruined me for my own home. Do you have a monthly rate?;5;7;5;5;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1390;10/27/2008;F0duUlc2DvIpfqsBS3G0eg;2o_IZWYP1ZCDJGyCJK9cJw;Fabulous decor.  Great service, awesome cocktails.  I haven't stayed here, but I am getting married here next year.  Sinesha, the wedding planner is fantastic.  They have been incredibly accommodating.;5;2;1;3;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1391;8/30/2009;FCPZr30CNMOutVIWW9ppCw;Nf1KqyKuYuqayBx2S0SUXQ;Even though I wasn't too crazy about the bathroom (no fan and very shallow sink), I LOVE this hotel. It's no wonder it has a five-star rating: incomparable customer service:friendly, professional staff:great gym:beautiful, well appointed rooms:Kiehl's products:and David Burke's Primehouse (their asiago popovers are to die for). The location is fantastic as well. We were upgraded to a suite at check-in (thanks, Marco, you're the best!), which was the perfect start to our six-day vacation in Chicago. There was no view to speak of (when we looked out our windows we saw the back of the hotel), but it didn't really matter since we didn't stay in much. It was great having an extra sitting area (with TV) to unwind in after a long day of walking around and taking in this awesome city. I would love to stay here again.;5;2;2;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1392;2/9/2011;mEMoTU1hK9t3JuxUQQfMjw;sgO-W7YX6ZHeNHQFOl3nGA;Quite nice option tucked just off Michigan Avenue.  My king room was huge with a cute work table, a playful white pleather barcelona-esque chair with matching ottoman, and a small upholstered bench.  Comfy bed, lots of light from the windows, free wireless, porthole pocket bathroom door, ipod jack and kiehl's bath goodies pretty much sums it up.  The workout equipment is packed into a small space but very up-to-date and there are many machines.  The staff is extremely pleasant.  I, surprisingly, got a great internet rate and for the amount I paid, this was truly an awesome spot for my latest foray into Chi-town.  Extra bonus is having David Burke's Primehouse right downstairs.;5;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1393;2/24/2010;ASM0yHj3TmIDK3XPSaj3FA;ts0TMHa09KInACwqR1z5jg;This review is more for their wedding planner/event planner not the hotel. If you are planning a wedding, I suggest going somewhere else. I can't even remember his name because it was like a bad dream. First, there was no congrats! That is just a basic greeting. Also, we were planning a wedding with a very large budget, but he was making us feel like he was doing us a favor. He just seemed liked a miserable person who was far from helpful and also suggested we move our wedding day to a Sunday when we clearly said we wanted a Sat. night wedding. I am a low key bride and this was the first time I could see how people go insane planning. There are many great hotels in the city for weddings..go somewhere else!;1;2;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1394;5/23/2007;F7o19Xwgh-Qtg-8zgkFNiw;BVdozpYiykmQtwk5WK4QsQ;Overrated, overhyped hotel.  The hotel bar is small, spartan.  The hallways have dark brown carpet that looks really old, dirty and shabby, and I think this is supposed to be a new hotel??  The halls are dark, narrow and have low ceilings.  The elevator is oldish and small, which kinda tells you the real age of the building.   The rooms are small, so small that there's a sliding door between the room and the bathroom because -- the room is too small to have a regular door!  The funny thing is that bathroom door has a porthole of a window, reminding you that your room isn't much bigger than a room on a cruiseship.  (Probably a subconscious slip on the designer's part.)  And that sliding door falls off its rails -- cheap!  Only one person can fit in the bathroom.  You step in and are immediately in front of the mirror, toilet and shower, with no room to move about!  The toilet was cheap quality -- I remember something breaking but easily fixable by me, but I forget, as this review is four months after my trip. Yes, there's a flat screen, and people like to mention that.  Really?  So what!  There's a funky chair and a funky table that looks like a tree stump.  For a while I thought that tree stump was a stool and had an argument with a friend as to what it was -- table or stool.  I guess it can be both, but officially, it's a table.  You know why I thought it was a stool?  Because there's not enough places to sit! There's no computer chair and no table.  So, you're going to put your laptop on that funky stump.  And who wants to crouch over and read their email? Sure, the bed linens look fluffy, but I stayed at the holiday inn express up in portland, and they had the same fluffy white linen/comforter!  Anyhow, the room is dark because of the brown carpet, and the walls are bare, except for black/white photographs, which makes the room look colder and more depressing.  Because as you look up at the walls and ceiling, you can tell this was probably once something I would describe as a residency hotel.  Or just a barebones, nothing special apartment I had in college.   So, I have no idea why this hotel is featured in magazines at all!  I guess people are easily fooled into staying because of how they showcase their suites.  Chicago's expensive, even in winter -- go figure, so figuring that in and the hotel's location, I'd pay no more than $130.  But for that price, I'd still feel ripped off!  I wouldn't bother with this hotel at all -- it's both cold feeling and shabby/dreary -- like drunks probably died in here 70 years ago. And there's wasn't much a view, just the building across the street.;2;2;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1395;8/22/2006;tizVttMASS4iwPx3QT7Xow;Ql1eg922BG8-JVp_zDFwcg;Probably the most COMFORTABLE hotel bed that I have ever slept in.  The overall hotel is modern, yet comfortable.  The service is attentive but not obsequious.  The only downside is the spa.  They are clearly still working out the kinks with the offerings.;4;2;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1396;11/10/2010;SgOT8cQhQ3vw1oaf0kT6Aw;PxHJTFg-tR7xgYm7jQEZ2Q;It's not what it's all cracked up to be and for the price, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. I know I might be on my own, but hear me out-- the room was really tiny, like NYC tiny, and it smelled like cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. Now let's start there--before I opened the door. I went to the front desk and checked in, went up stairs to my room, which was not the room number they told me, it was a converted conference room of some sort that they didn't even bother to change the name to a number. I proceeded to call the front desk and let them know that my room did not exist, which is when they finally told me it was actually called "study number 1". Went to put my key card in and did not work, so I tried a few other times before I finally gave up and called the front desk again. They told me to try again in a couple of minutes and if it didn't work, to go downstairs and get a new card. Of course, I had to go and get a new card. So I go downstairs and wait in what seems like the longest line (which I know wasn't their fault but I was just annoyed) then got a new card and headed back upstairs. Guess what? It DOESN'T WORK... AGAIN! I call the front desk again and get an answer by an equally annoyed front desk person, who tells me that I must be doing something wrong because the room key works. How rude! Finally, a very nice employee comes in and tries to use my key, which does not work (thankyouverymuch front desk girl). He got it opened with his key and had to get me a copy similar to his key for the remainder of my stay. That same night I was getting ready for an event and had my itunes on while chatting with a co-worker, when I was interrupted by the concierge because "people were complaining about the noise level"--ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What kind of dorm room/church retreat twilight zone was I in? I turned it off... I will give this place 3 stars only because of their location--it's in the middle of where everyone wants to be and all the shopping. Maybe next time James Hotel.;3;1;0;1;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1398;4/9/2011;e9tVKOvZxEPk24HDvepskw;0RxRLXTOXW37tYIcco5dLQ;By far my favorite hotel in Chicago. The design is modern, but what really makes it a great place to stay is the people who work there. They understand service.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1399;3/17/2011;Qgz4zb6O4TG8i97EtJT-fw;4EgkJZJJboI_fssQ8h69Ug;I stayed at The James for 4 nights - 2 nights work and 2 nights play! This was the perfect place to stay. The first night I went to the bar for a bite and a drink. The bartender was very friendly and even made me a concotion based on my likings. I got the Kobe Corndogs which were very good. You can tell that they use quality ingredients. The next morning I realized that I needed to make colored copies on my way since I had to make some changes to my presentation. Of course I am running late too, so the manager helped me out and printed out everything I needed. He went the extra mile and was really nice and quick. During our stay, we also happened to wander into J Bar on Friday and Saturday night. This lounge was small, but a perfect size for the amount of people they accomodate on a normal day. The drinks were a bit pricey but stout - so well worth it. And the music was ideal for a lounge - all the latest hits. We also ordered in breakfast one morning. The entree was huge, filling, and tasty - quality ingredients once again. Room service usually lets me down, but not  at The James! The rooms were always clean. My boyfriend and I were a mess and the maid always seemed to be able to put things away where they belonged. My sister, who was staying next door thinks she cleaned up too much and that it was weird. But being there for 4 days... I appreciated it! The beds were comfortable, mini bar well stocked, and Kiehl's products!!! Turn down service every night with little mini cookies. The only downfall about this place is the street noise, but the hotel isn't to blame. I give them 5 stars for a perfect hotel experience 4 days in a row.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1400;4/29/2009;6HfIWvZHbVoV2tOAUdoorg;Zq_1sUXh5EcAkUPCHaQehg;I've been meaning to review The James for almost a year now. My husband  and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We, being designers, wanted to stay in a modern hotel. After doing a little online research, I found The James and it looked like a place that we would love! OMG, The James was heaven! We stayed in the penthouse. It has beautiful walnut furniture, walls and floors. The bathroom is all marble. I love the combination of walnut and marble. It's full of designer furniture, clean lines, flush closets, pocket doors and beautiful materials. The concierge knew that it was our wedding night, so when we walked in, completely exhausted after a long, but wonderful day, there was some cool lounge music playing lightly throughout the room and there was a bottle of champagne on ice and a nice little tray of cookies. We proceeded to enjoy our champagne while enjoying the wonderful view of the city. And then, like the design nerds we are, we completely examined all the well-designed features of every nook and cranny of that room. The interior design is really great. I want my condo to look exactly like that someday. And I want to have my iPod streaming music through every room! Even their music selection was totally us. The bathroom was awesome: big, clean shower, huge, marble bathtub complete with an LCD TV. They have Kiehl's bath products. It was all just so beautiful! We also ordered room service. We filled out a little card and hung it on our door before we went to bed. And at our requested time, they delivered our breakfast and we ate it at the dining room table while, once again, enjoying the amazing view of the city. Check out time wasn't until 2:00 so we milked that one! We wanted to stay there as long as possible! I'd like to move in :);5;1;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1401;3/1/2010;nNjUaPrqZeTJuau1VN8WSw;G87zEbu0oPpYzmn4LUMC3g;There are just a couple of things that hold me back from giving the full five stars. One is that many of the rooms are interior-facing and have absolutely no view [except into other rooms, which may or may not be OK depending on who is occupying them]. The other is the simple fact that the bar for hotels in Chicago is so high, and this place isn't quite as slick as the Peninsula or Four Seasons. That said, it also doesn't cost nearly what those places do, so the value for price is terrific. I'd recommend registering your e-mail with them on-line. I got a great e-mail offer for $129/night with a $50 food-and-beverage credit that was a wonderful bargain. The lobby is long and narrow, with a small lounge to the left just outside David Burke's Primehouse. That restaurant offers amazing lunch bargains, so it's certainly worth checking out midday. Their side of steamed asparagus with shallots is amazing. My great rate was actually for a studio suite--not just the standard room. When I first walked in the room, I wasn't sure about it, but after hanging out a few minutes, I really got to like the layout. The sleeping area is very small, far away from the door. It's really kind of a nook, with just the bed and two wall-mounted shelves that serve as bedside tables. There's also a flat-screen TV there. Most of the space in the studio suites is devoted to living area, which, when you think about it, is really where you want your space. There's also a huge bar with full bottles [not minis] of several liquors and a well-stocked fridge. There's plenty of shelf and counter space included with the bar, as well as an iPod-ready stereo. There's lots of glassware, but only martini glasses and highballs. No wine glasses or swizzle sticks. Oh, and ice is provided by room service. I'm on a campaign to get hotels to put ice machines on each floor. No one wants to have to call and wait. The room decor has a mid-century feel, with low-slung, clean-lined furniture. The color scheme is mostly brown and off-white, with big splashes of red for accent. Most of the lighting is on dimmers, so you can adjust it to your mood. All in all, it's a pretty attractive room. The bathroom is narrow with a tub/shower combo, but plenty of counter space. It's been renovated since it was the Lenox Suites, but there's a little wear and tear showing, such as chips in the bathtub molding and an unraveling robe. This was a quick trip, so I didn't get to check out the spa, gym, or JBar. Next time. Service is of the friendly and efficient type, rather than the formal and polished as at some of the highest-end places in town. Had no issues with getting what I needed, though. Room service breakfast was prompt, tasty, exactly as ordered, and in large portion. Others have commented about problems with the elevators, but I had no long waits at all. They are smallish, though. Location is perfect, two blocks from the Grand Red Line stop, one block from the Mag Mile, across the street from a Trader Joe's, and two blocks from a P. F. Chang's and a Joe's Seafood if you want chain food. If you're a hotel freak like me and want to check out some others, you're in pretty easy walking distance from a huge number worth looking at--Trump, Conrad, Peninsula, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Drake. The Coq d'Or at the Drake is the perfect old-school hotel bar. They started serving ten minutes after Prohibition was repealed and the bartenders all look like they've been there since that day. If price is no object and you must have the best in Chicago, check out the Peninsula. If you're looking for the point where price and quality cross on the grid, look no further than the James.;4;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1402;12/29/2009;myHVn4tfmDvVIOEzp;kCIeEgcZIOvsigLrHn7rcg;I had a excellent experience at The James Hotel.  My number one problem that I have when traveling is that I can't find a hotel that will except a rottweiler.  Sure, they'll advertise they are pet friendly, but what they really mean is only lap dogs are allowed.  The James Hotel accepts all breed and has no weight restriction with pets.  The rooms were ultra modern and cozy.  As for their bed, it's awesome.  Its also in the heart of the city and if you don't mind walking, you definitely don't need to hail a cab.  I would love to stay there again...in a heartbeat.  Very pricey...be warned!  But I guess you get what you pay for.;5;1;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1404;3/13/2010;5rMWphspt-sxLs7chPtz0g;MqCAvFMgeCn-gjsBisuFvg;For my birthday we did a one-night getaway to downtown, which from the Far North Side is kind of an exotic locale I suppose, but we weren't there to see the sights, although the location seems pretty optimal for tourists. Anyway, this really was a fabulous hotel. It was quiet and sort of minimalist without seeming austere. The concierge had that kind of haughty politeness that only concierges at fancy hotels can rightly have. The bed was *amazingly* comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The European breakfast comprised very tasty baked goodies. And bonus points for being across the street from Trader Joe's. It's hard to imagine how you could really be disappointed booking here.;5;0;1;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

I have stayed at the James twice.  When i first walked into the lobby i knew i would be taken care of.  Every detail, from the location of the front desk, the lighting changes as one moves through the lobby, and the subdued modern decor show so clearly that someone thought very hard about how to make ME and my friends comfortable. Everyone is polite, but none suck up.  We are all equals, from the people who clean to the front desk and the managers, all of us part of an experience, that has been an integral goal of human society for ten thousand years--how to welcome a guest. Well, this hotel has it figured out, at least for me.  Everything is clean.  the decor is subtle, almost minimalist, but complete.  There is no hard sell of candy, no 7 dollar charge for a sip from a bottle of water left on the bedside table.  Internet is free, easy to log on and available throughout the hotel.  Lighting in the room is perfect for a computer, not a  newspaper.  The hotel is a remarkable achievement. If you can stay here do!;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1415;12/17/2009;B7pWlUzNA;E9xYJMx9qEpr5JKzFFjh8Q;I love the modern take on this hotel. The little things like the vintage luggage "art work" in the lobby was cool, and bed style with pictures not hung but layed on top of the head board was unique. Location is definitly a plus. Being in the River North area, not far from many phenominal eating and entertainment spots, along with the Red Line a very few short blocks away. I thought the elevator was very shotty. That was the only thing that really showed the age of the building. I might as well of been walking on concrete in the room, because there was no padding at all, but hey, those are just litte things. Overall, The James is a great stay. The price was fair, but I believe it was a stay 2 nights and get one free special at the time. Truthfully, I wouldn't stay there if there wasn't a special though. J Bar is also a plus if you want to finish off the night with a couple cocktails right in your hotel.;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw
1416;5/30/2010;aI6mUDIIiisjoJvjfDXmAw;YaIw4XffGO1cYXLAwYqPxw;My wife and I just celebrated our five-year anniversary and spent a night The James. Our stay was fantastic. Upon arrival I mentioned our celebration. Later that afternoon in-room dining delivered a special congratulatory gift with a personalized card. We also had use of the house car, which was terrific. Booked through Hotwire then upgraded to a junior suite for a small fee. Good call. What we especially appreciated was a standard 2p check-in. Even better, the standard check out time is 2p, which gave us plenty of time to have a leisurely lunch and visit to the Apple store with plenty of time to spare. The only surprise was $50 per night for parking, so unless you need in and out privileges, go with self-park. You can't beat the location: one block off Michigan Ave  in the heart of the mag mile. Overall, kudos to The James for helping to make our weekend especially memorable.;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

1418;7/26/2012;4AX9;EqKrQPQpkwZhgHRXDG1lkg;There were pros and cons.   Pros: Location couldn't be better.  We stayed at the lakefront location last year and even though that hotel was in better shape and the stay was an overall better experience, we preferred the centralized location of this hotel.   Check in was efficient if not overly friendly. Room was up to date, clean, and boasts very comfortable beds.   Breakfast was well cooked and of good quality, although often a little on the chilly side. Reception drinks were well-made and the line moved quickly.  Excellent snacks. The attached restaurant (not run by Hilton) was *wonderful*. Cons: (Small complaint) No automatic upgrade for Diamond members.  I didn't bother to ask because this was a weekend point redemption and I was pretty sure they were sold out by that point. It's nice to be recognized for loyalty. Breakfast seemed incredibly understaffed.  Tables sat waiting to be bussed for 30 minutes or more.  People were wandering around with trays looking for places to sit while 1/3 of the tables were piled with garbage and dishes. The floors were sticky and dirty.  The service area was sticky with spilled food and sported balled up napkins and discarded cups. Food was chilly even as it came out of the back because I'm guessing they had to make it way ahead of time.  Breakfast was regular-weekend crowded, not line-snaking around the atrium crowded, so I can't imagine why the cooks and bussers seemed to be so overworked.  Maybe everyone called in sick that day? Price was bad.  Granted we came for a weekend in the middle of summer, but the price on this hotel for that weekend was the same or more than Conrad, the Drake, or the Wit.  I opted instead for a rewards redemption, but I had to bust out the same number of points I would have for anything in Hilton's luxury line.  So my expectations were enhanced and as a result, I was less than impressed. I love the Embassy Suites chain in general and as we travel and move around a lot, I've stayed at 30-40 different ES properties over the past 15 years or so.  This one was middle of the road.  The price was exhorbitant in comparison.  If you are staying with kids and you can snag a price of say, $179 or less, then give this place a shot.  But if you are trying to get away as a couple, there are better choices.  Much better.  Please don't EVER pay the $349+ dollars they wanted for last weekend.;3;2;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1419;11/4/2011;h041Zubjhy6wdDkW1tRprw;kvFWIY7f_0J43_nxhUb5jA;This review comes to you, live, directly from my smelly, uncomfortable, and loud as hell, suite. I don't know where to start. The usual culprit of rude and obnoxious staff? The barging in of some staff members this morning while I was in the shower, to "update my TV," despite the privacy lock being on. (The prelude to this incident was yesterday, when the maid continually knocked on my door while the do not disturb hanger was on the knob, and again the privacy lock was on, to interrupt a much needed nap, to ask me if I wanted a bag of ice). How about the extremely loud atmosphere, which includes the loud waterfall in the lobby? The fact that you can't walk to the elevator without a bloody housekeeping cart in the way? My room had a lovely view of the parking garage, which isn't horrible, since it IS Chicago and is surrounded by structures, but I was told the hotel was fully booked, and no other room was open by the extremely helpful and competent clerk. Come to find out that the hotel was almost completely open and the night manager didn't know why the clerk earlier had told me they were booked. This hotel has just been an awful experience from the get go. I have stayed at Embassy Suites Lakefront once or twice, and it was okay, but this one is not impressive at all. I would avoid this one. Stay at a Marriott hotel instead! This is pretty much just a glorified Motel 6.;1;2;1;2;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1420;12/29/2011;HfG-MZsIkY1Yh9v949cPng;V41PVFHlkAN3D1w_zZV0Bg;The good - the great concierge, front desk help, and the food for breakfast set this place above the pack.   The rooms were also big and cheap for a nightly stay through Christmas. It's also got a pool and hot tub that I used, as well as a free business center, which made me happy for when I was checking in for my return flight. The OK - The layout of the atrium is a bit confusing. Only one staircase down leads to the first floor? Weird.  And of course, since it's downtown, it is ever so difficult to find reasonable parking. The bad - the layout of the kitchen and dining area needs major major rework. Supremely confusing. So am I supposed to simply bypass teh ENORMOUS LINE of tourists if I don't want a omelette? Or am I supposed to suffer through 30 minutes of wiating for just simple french toast?  And the capacity isn't as big.  And the employees showed their frustrations ... I would be as crass and rude as their employees during breakfast if I had to get my butt out of bed super early just to have thousands of people go through a terribly laid out place. And about that room ... the thermostat was either broken or the place couldn't heat up well.  I had to set it to 80 deg just to get it a normal temperature (a sensor I have in my phone put the room at 70 when the thermostat said 80). Also, paid wifi? WTF? What is this, 2004? Also, what is happening to parents in this country? Control your idiot children and out of control tweens please!   Finally, the bathroom needed a little cleaning around the edges. Nothing super terrible but still, after seeing the air vent directly above the showerhead with grime on it, I had to clean it myself just so I wouldn't be bothered by it. Protip: if you're going to have free awesome breakfast, expect traffic! Major rework is needed to keep up with capacity and how utterly confusing it all was. Would I recommend it? Of course.  Just get up at 6:30 for breakfast and you're set and you bypass the long line of tourists also there, and bypass the majority of the complaints I have.  You also can't beat the price for the location.;3;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1421;10/28/2011;QmKGkgsAGLrGaBXKutOz2A;x_axtCj_KMcWdf1WQ6BbdQ;I'll come back to this hotel. Rooms: 1 bedroom king suite was perfect for my needs. The bedroom was simple and closed off, which is exactly what I like. The living area had a couch, a chair, table with an office chair. The room also came with a rerigerator as well. Very clean, well-maintained. My only complaint was that central air didn't seem to work too well and I like to keep my rooms very cool. Evening manager's reception: well liquor drinks, 2 draft beers (MGD and miller lite). The snacks are very decent- on a Sunday night, it was pita bread with spinach & artichoke dip and fresh vegetables with ranch. Breakfast in the morning: The cooks who make your cooked-to-order breakfast are VERY nice! There is a variety of cereal, juices, fruits, and other hot breakfast items. Workout room has 3 treadmills, 2 elipticals and a stationary bike. There are mats and hand weights as well. Hotel has on-sight valet parking. It's underground and the valet staff are very friendly. Parking is $46/night. Starbucks is in the same building, but you do need to go outside to the corner of Ohio and State.;4;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

This was in an excellent location with the weber grill restaurant right across the street.We checked in and had a nice suite on the 9th floor with a great view off of state street(street noise was not loud either).The room was very spacious and it had 2 tvs in the room and one was a flat screen.One plus to this place was the free breakfast & cooked to order eggs. They also have a happy hour in the evening with free drinks & snacks also.The indoor pool was no real big, but nice enough to swim in. Me & my honey also enjoyed the hot tub and the jets felt good on my back.You do have to pay for the internet in your room & in the atrium area.They do have a business center with 3 computers that you get on the internet for free.All the employees here are very friendly & helpful and they answer all your questions.Parking here is pretty expensive so you might have to look around to get a deal in this area.I would definitely stay at this place again. Its close to navy pier,and all the good dining. Its also nice because you can hop on the train close by and all the buses.;4;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1423;4/13/2012;VFoTpBi2UiGV;BCSWG88lvIdZN1agUNXA4w;A new fan! Family friendly and truly a gem in downtown Chicago! Our stay was brief but unforgettable. The best was the phenomenal complimentary breakfast and great parking. You can actually check out and leave your vehicle till 3:00 pm allowing you to continue to enjoy all of the wonderful shopping, eating and sightseeing nearby without the worry of "Omg where do I park?" Loved it, love it! Pool could be bigger but hey, who needs a pool when you got a whole city to explore??!!.;4;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

Perfect for the four ladies to enjoy themselves. Two queen beds. A very large bathroom with an awesome tub. The front room had two couches to relax on while watching tv. Very nice and clean. The bar area was open with a loud waterfall. Guests drink for free during certain hours with their room key. The ladies were happy about this. There were tables set up and it was great to catch up with everyone. They claim they will always stay at this location due to its close proximity to the sites in the city. Bike parking on the street (street sign poles).;4;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1426;2/13/2011;4zixPXEiEzk1GdQCoq0hGQ;CQPewybuIByC8wgps9CmqA;From the time, I had made the reservation until I left the hotel, I had an  excellent stay! Checked in on Saturday at noon.  Check in was very easy - no long lines.  Manager on Duty had explained about the Manager's Reception and about the morning breakfast.   I knew the hotel is going through a renovation.  When I got out of the elevator, I was blown away.   The carpeting (shades of red, orange, brown and black design) is really sharp - very contemporary, the walls are standard white. I opened the door and was blown awhile.  The room is done in browns and tans, modern furniture.  You can tell everything was new. The bedding is very comfortable.  Had a very good night sleep. I did make it to the Manager's Reception.  I was great that they had both hot and cold snacks.   I had ordered the BLT sandwich through room service.  I was told it would be delivered within 25 minutes.  I believe it was less than 25 minutes.  Great Job!!   The breakfast was very easy to maneuver around.  The cooked-to-order breakfast list was not long even though there was a gymnastics group staying at the hotel.   I did not use the pool or the complimentary business center but both very clean. Check out was also very painless.;5;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1427;8/10/2010;w3CjaS5-D2m;g5qD10shooDJEPjt6miMrw;Stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend and was very happy with the hotel, the service and amenities. Location is great (right off the Grand-Red stop of the L), so easy to get to and close to a lot of great restaurants and activities. Wi-fi was a little slow, but there is a business center with 4 computers that you can use (for free!). Yes, it can be busy in there, just go during random hours (2am is a good time) and you're golden. Definitely would stay here again and recommend for anyone who is looking for a little extra room to spread out.;4;2;2;1;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1428;8/13/2009;f6WYXrPRCsjS0dtH0BpKcA;BejxpW2BF1xJbVy0uET2fQ;Not as good as other embassy suites we've stayed. More expensive, parking is additional $49 per night, rooms older and a little stale smelling.  Had to get the manager to over-ride billing us twice for room internet use for both my wife and I - also free to members at other embassy suites.  Room lacked power outlets in usable positions.   5.30pm happy hour & snacks is restricted to 1 drink per room key.  Others have never had this restriction and the staff at other hotels friendlier.  We wont stay here again.   At least the Italian restaurant next door is excellent - do go there.;2;0;1;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1429;5/22/2010;7VR0lKMNzKYomBCrQb7eng;40pYoBJA9rcoXPZqWGyyfg;Good hotel, great location.  You're right in the middle of things at this Embassy Suites, around plenty of shopping and public transit and sightseeing possibilities.   The suites are pretty typical fare.  The front room is a combination dining room-living room-kitchenette, with a sofabed, fridge, and microwave.  I was happy to see that the front wall of the suite was an actual wall and not a curtain-covered window like many Embassy Suites properties.  The bedroom had its own vanity with a sink and mirror, which was a very nice touch.  If I'd been sharing the room with anyone, that would've made things a little easier.  The bathroom was well-lit and very clean, and the toiletries smelled nice enough that I actually used them instead of the ones I brought.   Breakfast is free but can get pretty mobbed.  There's also a free happy hour, though I was never around for it.  For all of the freebies, though, it's disappointing that the internet access is over $10 (with tax).  I think in 2010, internet should be an amenity provided to guests and not a pricey luxury service.  Can I trade the extra sink for some free wifi?  If it were free, the bad connection and crappy speeds I experienced would be more excusable. I'd stay here again, though I'd be tempted to return to the Hilton Garden Inn that's across the street instead.;4;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1430;2/1/2007;r5CyQWHjnogvJk2cwO1QZw;VveQW3yKqgi8gAjwKzUVBg;This hotel is pretty good for travel on leisure, especially if you are trying to save money on a group, but it falls short on business travel. Basically, I care about three things when travelling: 1. Free Internet 2. A good gym 3. A good breakfast The internet here both cost money and was difficult to set up. The gym was OK for a hotel, but still not great. The breakfast seemed pretty good though. My suite was fine and actually quite large. Overall, it's definitely a good value, especially for downtown Chicago, but I don't think I'll be coming back here when I'm in town on business.;3;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1431;8/31/2010;lcSV3BzTFyZVqupmN;QfdVvVootXQO5BeEeg7seg;I like to get loud and party probably more than most other people. However, when I'm trying to sleep in my hotel room and I can hear people screaming across the atrium and pounding on doors at 3 am., that's just bullshit. Seriously, there was this dude pounding on a hotel room door across the atrium for at least 20 minutes. I'm sure the rest of the hotel guests were awakened just as I was. It took the security guard 20 minutes to get up there and confront the jackass. On the brightside, the staff at the hotel was really friendly and helpful. The valet parking crew really shined. My room was clean and comfortable. The free buffet breakfast is a very nice plus. I'm a fan of the Embassy Suites concept but I don't think I'll stay at one again if something isnt done to soundproof the rooms more sufficiently. That is unless I'm there to party all night and to be the one to make all that noise! The Embassy Suites needs to make their rooms a little more soundproof however with all of the insanity that goes on all through the night in the atrium.;2;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
1432;7/24/2005;iuqi3Ct9qMbUv;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;This is one of two Embassy Suites in downtown. This blocky red brick building contains rooms surrounding a central atrium. Guests enjoy a widespread breakfast buffet that is included in your room rate, plus there is a free cocktail hour in the evening. Each of the sizeable rooms is built like a suite, so families love to stay here. The new Italian restaurant on the main level seems more popular than the former Greek restaurant here.;4;1;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

1434;7/7/2011;dt;i8UbjAA5Njga5VIaLMSIKA;This hotel definitely caters to families and big groups. The rooms are well-sized and well-appointed (furnishings new/recently updated). The common areas are generally well-kept and clean.  The pool is small, but nice, as is the fitness area.  There's an "office" services (printer, computer, Internet) which is available (apparently) free for guests.   We've never tried the Manager's Reception (the food doesn't look that great), but the breakfast buffet is substantial, and pretty high quality food. GREAT location - walkable to shopping, eating, museums, etc.  You'll save a lot in taxi fares if you stay here. Some of the downsides: a. Front desk staff is pretty perfunctory in how they deal with you. Check-in and check-out can take a long time, and if you want to store your bags (after you check-out), you might wait a long time. b. There aren't enough elevators at peak time (which is pretty much all day during the weekend).  Long lines for the elevators, which seem to stop on the lobby level only one at a time. c. Valet parking is very expensive ($46). d. Because of the hotel layout (all rooms face a courtyard), the rooms can be pretty noisy.;4;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

1439;5/3/2010;RitSDRm3Os;-MQPWNRr3O4PVD2qBul05Q;Hello.  I'm only writing this review for the pool and the lobby, since that's the only part of the hotel I really visited. This was due to the fact that my own pool at the Hilton Garden Inn (just around the corner) had a broken pool and they let us use the one at the Embassy Suites. Now, the lobby of this place is cool.  It's one of those open atrium hotels where all of the rooms look out on the central atrium, so it's really nice and open. However, just an FYI, the pool sucks. Sorry, Embassy Suites.  It smells like a stinking cesspool of chemicals in the pool room.  The water in the pool has detritus floating around in it.  The hot tub is so dirty that it is foaming out of control and the water is yellow-ish.  The floor was soaking wet and kind of dirty, so you felt nervous about putting your bare feet on it.  All in all, I was so grossed out by the pool and the hot tub, the the most exposure I would give myself to it was putting my feet into the hot tub and watching the foam stick to my calves and imaging microorganisms burrowing into my skin. So, don't come here for the pool.   Otherwise, rely on everyone else's comments regarding the rooms. That is all I have to say.;3;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

1441;8/27/2012;j7O8rJ1eSPQRyzPOta0A;yd4oemuXJO9MmStmbh5Jrw;I loved my stay in this hotel.  Check-in took too long, but was worth it.  That's because the friendly staff member worked hard to find me a great room, and found a way to get me free wireless during my stay.  Good start! On the other hand, the first (well-earned) cocktail i had was a $14 disaster.  A martini in a (not-cold) wine glass!  Come on.  Despite really enjoying my time in this hotel, i'll get the negative out of the way first - mediocre overpriced restaurant.  LOUSY lattes in the coffee shop. The room was small, but clean.  Nice furniture.  Nice view. Good location.  Just enough removed from the Magnificent Mile that it wasn't loud at night.  A perfect spot for watching the lights of the skyscrapers and reflections on the river.  Easy walk to the L. Easy walks or cabs to about any restaurant in town.  I took an warm afternoon stroll through Navy Pier. On the river boat Chicago architecture tour, i learned that the Sheraton i was staying in was designed to look like a cruise ship.  Finally...  it all made sense.  In fact, i was proudly staying at one of the structures featured by the narrator during the super-informative, beautiful look at the city.  (Maybe i should be reviewing that.) I stayed here over St. Patrick's Day weekend.  I couldn't believe that i was able to select what type of view i got (especially since i booked my room Shattner-style - bidding on Priceline...  woo hoo - did i get a bargain!).  I got lucky with the river-view, that just happened to include a front-row view of when they turned the river bright green.  That, and the 80 degree weather, made for a particularly upbeat end to a quick business trip. Great Irish pub next door on the riverfront.  Great riverwalk/river-jog location!   I noticed there is a liquor store one block away, so there is a solution to the lousy drink. And a Starbucks graces the entry of a grocery store that is only about two blocks away. As you can see, i recommend staying here.;4;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

I could hear every door close all night long. Every five minutes a door would open and close and I could hear it from the bed. Phone conversations in the next room were easily heard. Surprising for a Sheraton. Three times during my stay, the key stopped working. I had to wait for an elevator down, walk to the lobby, get new keys and try again. Many people in our party were having this problem. It got old quickly. Mini bar cost more than was advertised on my final bill.;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1444;4/3/2012;Ki4qdg;-THLGnsYKu3yQAsy_tt1fw;If you're using Google maps, it will probably direct you to the service entrance. The main entrance is fairly obvious, but you might have to go around the block to find it. Really nice view from most of the rooms, either of the river and lake or of the city. If you're someone who likes to exercise, this hotel is literally one block from the paved lake-side trail. The trail goes all the way down to the museum campuses (and the yacht club and Navy Pier). There are also rental kayaks and bikes available just below the bridge...so you can literally find stuff to do right outside your hotel door. The hotel gym is ample and there is evidently an LA Fitness nearby, which I saw pop up on my Yelp app. I walked by one other gym. I was disappointed in the quality of the towels, but the bed was fantastic. Spacious suite, with not only bedside outlets for your phone (and desktop outlets for your laptop) but TWO ipod/phone radios so I was able to listen to my own music. The stars were lost due to cleanliness. In the hallway (26th floor) there was a half-eaten cookie and TWO dental picks which stayed on the ground for well over 24 hours. That is just foul. In our room, there was a gummy worm on the floor. We only brought gummy watermelons. Again, foul. However, we did not receive any bug bites, which I always worry about when staying in a pricier hotel in a large city. Valet is quick, taxis are always right outside the door. Lots of restaurants within walking distance.;3;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

1446;5/12/2012;Ey4C6Jt1BlNd1ctPC;nsyiz-kNhQPxzLtiF3P7fA;Review is for the hotel as a conference center. It was fine and functional. The setup with the escalators to go between the various floors is confusingly laid out, all the up escalators are on one side and all the downs are on another. Kept going to the wrong side. The lobbies were fine and comfortable. The staff at the bar were pretty brusque though. The wi-fi access is poor in many of the conference rooms, which was very frustrating. The bathrooms are nice, meeting rooms were standard. The downstairs rooms for exhibitions were set up very poorly for cleanup - major exhibition with about 100 different tables giving out papers, brochures, food, and in the end there were like two small trash cans for the entire room, so there was trash everywhere.;3;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1447;1/27/2012;6-N4xngcLhrRHIHYhiBSOQ;1YZ0wUpBZPEYHXUsQAjF4g;I'm with most of my fellow reviewers... I have very mixed feelings about this hotel. The bed was super-comfortable.  I really wanted to take the pillows home with me.  The view from my room on the 20th floor was incredible!  That's about the only positive thing I can say. The bell service was supposed to deliver some important items to co-workers who were staying at the hotel... they didn't get them on time, but I was still charged the $2.50 to-room delivery charge. *sigh* Internet - both wired and wireless - is $12.95 a day! What a rip-off!! I would expect wired service to be free of charge. My room key cards would not stay activated.  They demagnetized the minute I put the card in the purse.  So, every time I came back from leaving my room, I had to call security to let me back in.  That was getting old really quick!  They suggested not putting the card in my purse, so I put it in my pant pocket... same issue.  I guess I'm supposed to carry the card around like an Olympic torch? Breakfast was ridiculously expensive!! To eat IN the restaurant was even more expensive than the same items for room service.  I had coffee, 2 eggs and toast, my bill was $24 (there goes my per diem... guess I'm skipping lunch). I have to say the valet guys out front were great! And the hotel is very clean and very pretty, but for a hotel of this size and status, I was expecting the little things to run just a little bit smoother...;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

This was our attempt to stay close by, but to have our privacy.... We pulled up for valet, and a rushed man came over and took our keys and asked if we needed any help with bags. "Yes, we do." was my reply. You should have seen the look on that mans face when he saw we only had one bag.... I was in an evening gown and heels while my fiance was in a tux for a winter evening reception in Chicago. Why would we risk dirtying ourselves for a bag? As if the attitude wasn't enough... we waited... and waited... for our bag to be delivered. We finally had to call down 3 times... The last time I called. I told the rude boy on the other end it was a red bag. He replied with "Well... hmm... we have A LOT of red bags down here.... so I'm not sure.... what... to do..." Finally I said I'd be down there in a short elevator ride to pick up my bag... and suddenly... eureka! The bag was found. WHAT A JOKE!;1;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1451;11/15/2011;kS4GVBVxCnKCAiRzj0zMDw;X3v0CfeYUjHTWRLb-VG-eg;Mixed feelings about the Sheraton. First of all, the bed and bedding was VERY COMFORTABLE. I slept like a baby swaddled up and happy. The towels were not crunchy or hard as hotel towels can so easily be. The view from the 14th floor was great and I enjoyed waking up to the view of a bustling downtown sprawl, without the noise. The luggage check and valet staff were great - very efficient and courteous. The downside to the Sheraton is that beyond coffee in your room, NOTHING is included in the $259/night price tag. That's one expensive bed, pillow, and morning coffee. You want Internet? That'll be $12.99/day. You have a third party payer who paid your stay in full? Be prepared to remind them of that, because they will ask for your credit card. You attend a conference? Be prepared for burnt coffee and stale bagels. I wouldn't voluntarily stay at the Sheraton again...unless my company gave me no choice. :-\;3;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

I'm in. Inside our room though, I couldn't hear a sound. Expensive food options but you are in such a good location just make a walk to the EL - less than a mile, and you'll be good to go in Chicago. Ask for a river view room. Close to everything if you arn't afraid of some brisk but simple Chicago native foot action.;3;2;1;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1453;4/19/2012;Q-S-xOXoJlkRQrl8aITxgg;0Igx-a1wAstiBDerGxXk2A;My hotel room was mostly clean (accepting the candy wrappers half way under the tv cabinet that were there when I checked in & when I left) and sort of run down, chipped sink, peeling wall paper.  The bed was really comfortable and the internet was pretty speedy. (But really $15 a day for wifi? Glad my conference included it.) The meeting rooms were mostly easily found and the coffee shop & cheaper breakfast/lunch place were fine.  So why 2 stars?  Normally I would leave it at 3 but c'mon. My room was over $250 a night. Yes, I realize I'm in downtown Chicago and that my room rate subsidizes the meeting rooms, but for that you can glue down the wall paper and give me towels that don't seem so tired.;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1454;5/9/2012;Q7FJU-WNJyWgM9uShK42eQ;IdJLaiacmF7UI9dHGltXsA;Had room reservations. Arrived at 11pm to be told that they are oversold and I needed to be put in a room with a pull out bed. NO other rooms in the hotel, I ask. Nope, the reply. As if I had a choice at 11pm after 6hrs of flight tugging 60lbs of luggage. Got to the room, and I use this term loosely. The pull out mattress (use that loosely as well), was about 60 yrs old and 3 inches thick. Would have woke up with wire marks permanently gouged into my back. Called down and asked to be moved to a new hotel... Oh, suddenly the manager found a room with a king bed. Well that's nice. Pretty sure I asked that 30 minutes before. Then was told that I would need to move rooms tomorrow. Going to claim squatters rights. Will give it 2 stars for the nice lady at the front desk who was very apologetic and understanding of my grief.;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1455;2/19/2012;QtkPjg8qwdfhwkcTKgUyWQ;lxLvaKzRcN-7gtxyywgRbA;This hotel is situated in a great area of Chicago, right next to the river. It is in prime location because you can walk to Michigan Ave for shopping or any restaurant that you want to. The layout of the hotel and cleanliness is great as well. The rooms of this hotel are small, even if you get a queen-bed room. The main reason I was unhappy with this hotel was because of the staff. From the door-man outside to the reception desk inside, they are not kind or professional. They all seem like they hate their jobs and are being forced to work there. My friend left my shoes that I needed for the evening at the front desk with my name and room number. When I sent my wife to ask them for the shoes, the man working there was very rude and didn't even listen to what she was asking for. He said there was nothing there. When I went later and spoke with another person, my shoes were there the whole time. Later, when I asked the front desk for a cab, they told me I would have to call-in for a cab or wait for one outside. I decided to walk outside and find a cab myself. When I finally flagged one down and asked it to pull into the hotel driveway, the bell-man (door-man) was so rude to me and treated me (31 yr old male) like a 10 year old child telling me that it was his job and I should have told him. Then why did the staff inside tell me I would have to get one myself if there was a bell-man outside for that job? After treating me like a child, he went on to embarrass me in front of my friends stating that he should get me a uniform so I could work there with him since I'm more pro-active than he is. WTH?! Does anyone treat guests that way? If this is how you want to be treated by staff at a renowned hotel chain, then this is the place for you. No professionalism, no courtesy, no spacious rooms. Would you take a chance with that kind of money?;2;2;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

Once you open the door to your room you can see why this place is rated an average of 3.  The rooms are small and while the carpet and wall paper are new the place feels old. It's really a big convention hotel which is who they cater to.  I bought a room on priceline for $100.  The parking is $50 and the internet is $13.  So figure it out.  It's still $163.  But would you expect less than that sort of nickel and dime from this outfit?   It's good if you don't need a car and want to be downtown.;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

1461;5/9/2009;qiN;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;This hotel gets high marks from me for it's consistency over the years. I stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers at least once a year for a global conference and it never fails to come through on all fronts. The guest rooms are spacious and very clean with all the special amenities and bed linens that make you want to stay in bed all day! The views are spectacular! Looking out on the lake, or the river or the city you really cannot go wrong. It makes our fine city look even better! The restaurants and bars have friendly and helpful servers working in them (a special thanks to the bartender in the lobby bar who brought a smile to my face the other night- you know who you are even though I've forgotten your name. Must have been all those martinis you were pouring for me!) I am here so often- that even the banquet help recognize me and say "Hi" and "Welcome back" when they see me. The Sheraton is located in a great spot- close to anything you want to do in Chicago and the concierge is always willing to toss out a new idea or two (especially helpful when all your global friends keep wanting to go get "Chicago pizza" or go to "Navy Pier" which, while great, are really not what I want to show people about our fine city! Valet parking is a breeze- just know that you need to take the elevator by the front doors down to the parking garage to pick up your car. It will not be brought around to the front of the hotel. Great location- close to everything Chicago has to offer, clean and spacious guest rooms, meeting rooms with all the necessary items to make sure things go smoothly, AND great help? Now this is a hotel that I don't mind coming to time and time again.;5;4;2;1;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The bad: - The climate was impossible to control - The nearest CTA station is a fairly brisk walk - The maids were terrible - The restaurants are all impossibly closed for hours at a time - The convention space is limited and spread across several floors The ugly: - The exhibit hall floor was dark and the ceiling was too low - Chicago Burger Company is a disgusting restaurant, way over priced and food poisoning inducing.;3;3;0;1;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1463;6/25/2009;m--6yowfoFMoq8HDPOpPkw;s85ov2JmELYoW2lwwmkVUg;Solid hotel with extra points for consistency of service and quality. My check in was quick and I got some extra amenities for being a Starwood member. Rooms are fairly spacious, clean, and I enjoy their beds and linens. I would suggest placing the "do not disturb" sign up if you're not an early riser. I forgot to do so two mornings in a row and I had housekeeping knocking at 7:30am (that's 5:30am PST for me so I was a grumpy face). Their meeting rooms are average but were ALWAYS freezing. However, they quickly came in to adjust the thermostat every time we called. I also don't know if it's because Chicago is such a high union-based city but the rates and charges for the meetings services were MUCH higher than other cities I've worked in. Note to self, budget wisely. This Sheraton has a great location and beautiful views. Their Chi-Bar had tasty cocktails and somewhat of a swanky decor. Overall, I look forward to coming back in March for our event. Let's hope the weather is on our side! :) 3.5 Stars;4;2;1;2;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

As indicated in other reviews here and on Expedia, and unless you're accustomed to a Motel 6 experience, this is a two/three star property at best, with outdated rooms, '70s style era Moen/Home Depot-cheap  fixtures, cramped rooms, pathetic service (leading all the way up to the CEO of Starwood as I've found) and room service...that NEVER arrives. And like other reviewers here and elsewhere, I too was FRAUDULENTLY charged for items/services never ordered and never received. Now we're getting serious here as this is the stuff people go to jail for especially if it's part of a pattern of abuse and indeed directly or indirectly endorsed/encouraged by management.

The lobby is nice but once we got to our room... it was definetely not FOUR STARS.  I would say it was more like a lower 3 star hotel hotel.  The bed was lumpy before anybody slept in it.  The room was tiny... the bathroom was tiny.  I pressed the wake up call button to arrange for one..

1470;3/10/2010;OWof9j12WT16-vwhJCxkjA;77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg;Not a fan.  I was back in town for a conference, and I have to say, the Sheraton did not impress me.   First off, the bed was uncomfortable.  I felt like I was sinking, and my back hurt everytime I woke up in the bed.  I had a better time sleeping on the loveseat (which I did one night).   Second, the gym is not included in your hotel fee.  $12 for one time and $20 for the duration of your stay.  Really?  I have never been to a hotel where the gym was NOT included in the hotel fee.   Third, the 'complimentary' breakfast on the 33rd floor will actually cost you about $20 unless you're on floors 31-38, something you don't find out until AFTER you've gotten some food and sat down and the little hostess-lady comes out without saying a word to slip a tray with a ticket on it onto your table charging your room.  There should've been signage or something by the food or upon entering the lounge cuz had I known I was going to pay $20 for a crappy bagel and some fruit, I would've gone out for breakfast at a real breakfast joint.  Maybe that was the point.   Fourth, not one single person who worked at the hotel told us about the gym fees or breakfast or even offered these things were available in the first place.  I feel things could've been better explained to us. Fifth, as the girls and I were getting ready to check out, we get a knock on the door from housekeeping asking us if she could come in to check our mini-fridge to see if we had taken anything.  Um...no.  That's unprofessional.  Come back when we've checked out.  While I'm on the topic of the mini-fridge, let me just say that it's waaayyyy too stocked with stuff.  If you had gone out to eat and brought some leftovers (like we did), you'd have NO room to put it in the fridge to keep it fresh.  Nevermind the fact that I could've taken some stuff out.  There should've been at least SOME room in the fridge for stuff not already in there.   Sixth, the internet isn't free unless you go to the 33rd floor.  This last one is just an extra complaint to add to the others that made the Sheraton less than an ideal place for me to stay.  I mean, for all that we're paying, we could've gotten more amenities included and better service.  I just didn't have the best time there, so I think the next time I'm in town and need to stay in a hotel, I'm gonna stay somewhere else.;1;2;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

Priceline did a great job giving me the 4 star hotel I requested. Sheraton was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at, I'm used to staying at Hampton Inns. The pros: *Fast elevator service! Lightening speed! *Friendly helpful valet, got us a cab with literally the snap of a finger *Great views (we had a view of the city and some view of lake Michigan on the 19th floor) *walking distance to EVERYTHING. * the most comfortable beds ever!!!! (seriously!!!) *windows that open.. I loved hearing the "city noise" at night. * VERY clean!!! Cons..... Well they charge you for evvvvverything. I'm unable to comment on the wireless internet, pool or gym because we didn't pay for those services. The mini fridge was stocked .... But a $5 kit Kat wasn't appealing to me. Rooms are small, bathrooms are SUPER small and seem very our dated. But..... Once you swallow the $50 parking bill, you'll fall in love with this hotel. There are a few restaurants (Shula's is great!!!) and bars. Two thumbs up!! (and located across the street from AMC which was great for a late night movie after touring the city all day);4;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1473;2/16/2009;EwG0DjV70o89wfNv7ojWpQ;hezWN2RmXC8M6sCQZi89Xg;Just absolutely love this hotel, it's staff, and everything about it.  Great location if you are visiting Chicago, want to be within walking distance of the great sites (i.e. Michigan avenue, Navy Pier, downtown, etc.), but do not want to be caught up in the tourist histeria of Michigan avenue hotels. The views of the river, lake, and city are outstanding if you get a city view that includes all.   Having traveled for years nearly 100% of the time earlier in my career, and staying downtown quite a bit, I think I have stayed at most of the great places in Chicago and in most big cities that I have been to. So I think I have seen it nearly all, both good and bad. This place is the most consistent that I have stayed at in Chicago outside of the Union League Club and the team here always exceeds my expectations, bar none. Traveling with the family?  I really recommend their mini-suites that are along the river, with an adjoining room for the kids.  Nice large room with lots of space to unwind, and with the adjoining room, you end up with two full bathrooms, three TV's, 3 phones, and 2 entry ways for everyone to fight over, plus a very large dining table if your order in, or need some extra space beyond the two desk areas to do work or have the kids play games. They really have kept the place up and it is very nicely appointed.  As far as the earlier comments about knobs or dials instead of digital readouts, these don't bother me.  I would hate for them to upgrade the units just to get more advanced readout displays, and our space was really well ventilated and comfortable. Pool and workout space is great, very clean, and well monitored. If you arrive early and your room is not available, or if you need a place to hang after checkout, I really recommend the club or concierge room on the 33rd floor.   Great complimentary snacks (great hors'vrs in the evening), fruit, coffee, tea, and bottled water, plus on the second level, great business center with computers for your use. Also, nice entertainment area for watching tv and relaxing.  My real favorite is the leather massage chair.  Really a nice perk! Oh, and if you are a starwood member (http://spg.com) you get express check in and check out, and you can use your points to get free rooms or discounted rooms that are an absolute steal. Be nice, and depending on availability, they will upgrade you for free.  They are really happy to do it, and you'll be happy too!;5;1;1;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

This place is clean, has plenty of bars and lounges on various floors, and valet. One thing about the valet service, they have a very confusing system. I was sent around the front entrance and down into the parking garage, after I had specifically asked for self park. When I pulled up to the attendant down under, he wanted to valet my car and when I asked him for self-park, AGAIN, he waived me off and down the lane without direction or courtesy. Needless to say, I ended up leaving the endless underground garage and parking at another facility across the street. Yes, the other facility charged me the similar $26, but I was happy to give them my money instead of you know who. The experience was festive and the lobbies are artfully fun. In the future I may venture to stay here, but I'll surely remember to take the train.;4;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1475;7/10/2010;l3bfq5pVu0opfvpCdVl-Dg;bx5BUrrQVkbqcPu0IyLKRQ;I stayed here with my Husband while he was attending a conference. The hotel is quite large and rightfully has plenty of quick elevators and a few escalators. There are a few bars, one of which has a great view and is decorated with a subdued elegance.  The other is quite funky and boasts bright colors and a more retro vibe. The rooms are large and the bed was super comfortable. The location is great, off the beaten path enough to be quiet but right next to the "Magnificent Mile" and the Pier. We had an issue with a phantom phone that, for no reason that I can find, turned itself on to speaker mode and blasted the dial tone in the middle of the night.  Three times.  The manager stared at me blankly and apologized.  Um, care to offer us another phone or perhaps send up a repair man? The gym fee is not included in the price of your hotel stay, which is a pretty big turn off for us.  Luckily, the weather was nice enough for a run outdoors and that run was much more enjoyable and memorable than a hotel treadmill could ever be.  So if you keep up with your workouts while on the road, consider the additional gym fee. Overall, the hotel is in great shape and I can deal with a freaky phone but the gym fee is downright nasty.;3;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1476;4/10/2008;5M3aQYX5T038tKxsxunnjQ;NRXW5s7FvDVN21Ey3ve4fA;Thing about hotel business is... it's all about the service, the willingness to go over and above for their guests, and the attention you give to your guests.   Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers had it all.   Also what everyone should understand is that... it's the nature of the business to enjoy all those things above when you have a connection.  So I guess you can say I have somewhat a biased opinion.   We stayed in a two-room suite complete with two LCD TVs, two double beds, two full bathrooms on the 19th floor.   We also had access to the Club Lounge on the 33rd floor which was great.  Free breakfast every morning.  Hor'dourves and snacks served in the afternoon.   When we had a difficult request for a particular service, the staff went over and beyond to get it done.  And they were kind about it from the beginning to the very end, making sure it was to our satisfaction.  They even made a couple of calls to our room to make sure everything was ok.  Now THAT's what I call caring for their guests! Now it's not to say that they don't have ANY flaws.  With the kind of price they charge their guests every night, high-speed wireless internet should be FREE.   But that's a minor concern.  After all, don't we all want to be AWAY from all the craziness of emails and things-to-do's when we're on vacation??;5;1;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1477;11/21/2010;K0hMvHZ3pgJkmwJmHG26Gw;GyYInrWOVwPEqECKOC9T3g;As a frequent traveler for work, I stay at many SPG properties.  Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago, this is by far the worst.   Why? 1)  They charge you to use the gym.  $12 per day or something like $24 for your entire stay.  I can't even begin on what a rip off that is. 2)  As a Gold or Platinum member, you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room.  They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. 3) They do not have wireless internet.  It is 2010- enough said. To charge you at least over $200 a night, all the above amenities should be built into that cost.  I would never stay here again.;1;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1478;4/5/2011;lizANcCABT6CRb1q2VMKhg;DMUlYOmgfVTDX8X7Rb4N6g;I stayed here for a conference recently. Very disappointed with the small and dated room, which reminds me of motel 6. The lobby was nice and fit the name of Sheraton. Location was convenient though I didn't have the time to walk down to navy pier. Walgreen one block away was nice for stocking up snacks and bottled water. Irregardless, a motel 6 room is not worth the price I paid for sheraton. Won't be staying here again.  Oh yeah, no wi-fi in rooms? I was told free WiFi is available in lobby, I wasn't able to find it. Use of the gym is $20/day. Across the river, the swishotel and hytt both have lower prices, nicer rooms, and the gym is free at the Hytt.;1;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1479;8/26/2011;jeOqDGalK3dptrj-3ftjGQ;iZ7efgZ4wyyzUJguDY9FWQ;The Good: clean and nice mattress. Fabulous views. Shula's Restaurant in the hotel is a good Steak house, expensive, but very good. The breakfast cafe was also good, and the catered meals were very good. Chibar was excellent, with good service and a great mojito. The Bad: lackadaisical maintenance. In my room alone: the door lock did not work. The armoire was probably unbalanced because the door and all the drawers would open by themselves. If I got up at night, this trap blocked the path to the bathroom and could have nailed me if I'd not been alert. Some of the staff demand tips. The bellhop held firm to my bags until I took out money for a tip (he hadn't helped with the bags, I brought them to him, and then retrieved them on my own when no help was available). The doorman passed me over twice until I took out cash for a tip so I could get a cab. Haven't had people this agressive for tips since I was in Bangkok Thailand where they live on tips alone. They charge for an internet connection, so I'm glad I brought my own hotspot. I was here for a convention. The escalator from the lobby was out for most of my stay, so we had quite a hike from one end of the hotel to the other and back, plus up and down multiple floors. Seems like they converted lower level space for meeting rooms as an afterthought because meeting rooms are split between 4th floor and the first floor, and there are no elevators to 1 and 2 below the lobby.;2;1;0;1;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The room was a nice size and the bed was so friggin comfortable.  I had so much trouble getting out of it. The gym is a ripoff at $12, but I guess since most guests are on the richer side, they can charge it.  Also, if you need a cab, the dude outside blows and whistle and TA-DA!  Cab.  How convenient. I don't like how this hotel doesn't have a candy bowl.  The first thing I looked for when I walked in was a candy bowl.  What a bummer.;4;1;1;3;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1481;6/20/2009;nZTChxayWtwsobZ;CE4xe7VhIWfI7MtHRkF8Hg;If you enjoy and/or need a firm mattress, this hotel is NOT for you!   The Sheraton has taken the "pillow-top mattress" concept to a whole new level, one which I (fortunately) had never experienced.  One which takes effort to crawl out of.  One which is nearly impossible to roll over in.   One which I would dare call a "pillow mattress", with no back support whatsoever.  Our room had two double beds, which we ended up using because we kept sinking into each other. The linens and duvet were lovely, our room had a great view of the river, service was good, it's an easy walk to Michigan Ave... I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars with a firmer bed.   PS: We Pricelined it day-of for $89. PPS: Overnight valet parking was $48. PPPS:  It's offically called the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper(sm) Bed, a "custom designed plush top mattress set", introducing, "a whole new level of comfort".  I'm sure there are folks out there who consider it cushy indulgence:I'll let you be the judge.;3;0;1;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The flat screen TV was in contrast to the aging furniture and decor.   For the amount of money we were paying, the value was minimal.   Despite having a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, housekeeping called to ask a question.  What's the point?  The front desk gave a room key without checking ID, which is very scary.;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

My rating is for the conferance rooms and not the hotel rooms sense I didn't actually stay at the hotel. While I really enjoyed the location of the hotel I felt the conferance rooms were poorly laid out. Some are upstairs some were down stairs. Also the temperature in the conferance rooms was freezing. I mean I had to take a few breaks and go outside because my hands were ready to fall off. The location is very nice however and the guest rooms look like they would have great views.

It is a hike to get to an el-stop, to transfer on busses would be easier said than done as well. The things that stood out to me were the lobby, which was welcoming though it was a bit dirty for me, and the Chicago Burger Company. Ken M wrote that CBC was disgusting but I think I'm going to have to disagree as my bleu cheese burger was cooked great and the fries were awesome at the time. I would have to visit back for another assessment but from what I've experienced so far, it wouldn't stop me from trying out again. As for the rooms...standard room.;3;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

1493;7/6/2009;MGNrPkRtdLt5lAuT4O3CuQ;cr8DlB2ErR898Nhen_0oSA;On a recent trip to Chicago, this was my home for 3 nights. I love the location of the hotel, it is in very close proximity to all the major attractions in Downtown Chicago such as Navy Pier, shopping, etc. When you drive up to this hotel and even when you walk in the lobby, you get the feeling that this is going to be a fantastic hotel with the grand entrance and the beautiful lobby. However, in terms of the rooms itself, I was kinda dissapointed especially because it is a Sheraton Hotel. We got what I believe is a standard room on the 18th floor and even walking through the hallway to get to the room, all the doors look dated and worn down. When we arrived at our room, my travel companion commented on how the lock looked as if someone broke it to it before. The room itself was also looked pretty dated with some heavy wooden closet doors, older looking bathroom and dated decor. The chair I'm sitting on even creaks like crazy every time I move. Though I have to say the most annoying part is the heavy doors to the rooms that slam shut everytime someone walks in and out of their room on the floor, so loud that I'm woke up every time...boo! But the bed itself are ok, pretty comfy. In terms of the other facilities offered by the hotel, the fitness center is equipped with some very nice treadmills (with the tv built in) and a full set of weights available for arm workouts. The pool itself, although indoor and relatively small is a nice place to relax after a hard workout as well. Since both are located on the 7th floor, you get a beautiful view of the Lake when you sit on one of the chairs around the pool. Another nice feature is the sundeck where a few sun chairs are set up and where you can soak up some sun. Unfortunately the sauna was broken or else I'd love to have used that as well. Overall, it's a great hotel in a prime location and awesome facilities. Would stay here again next time I'm in Chicago.;3;3;3;3;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

I registered for a Deluxe ..something room at $160+ a night.. when i checked in they didn't have any of those available so i got a little room. Since i didn't have a lot of choice and was hard-pressed for time i though well how bad can a little room be? and i took it.. thinking they will adjust prices accordingly. Well it turned out that by "basic" room they really do mean basic. When i finally got up to the room there was numerous issues with the room one of which was that the refrigerator was open and stuff missing from it and it made some awful noise. I asked them to take care of it and they did not so i had to deal with them taking off all the charges from my account for all the boose that i didnt' drink... then lights were not working in the bathroom and stuff like that... I would love to go on for more but i dont have much time. So in short don't stay here!!! I made this mistake once and i will not do it again.

Location is good, a few blocks away from Michigan ave, but on the lower side so you would actually have to take the stairs to go up to Michigan... and it's about a 10 minute walk to it. Pool is nice too, the view from the pool area is also very nice! Could be bigger but I find nowadays that almost all hotel pools are on the smaller side. We didn't use the hotel parking, because we were there on a weekend and the metered spots are free at night and on Sunday when we were there (it may have changed)... so we were able to locate street parking for free or for a nominal fee! Apparently the last floors of the hotel, the windows of the rooms are bulletproof because a President stayed there once, I think our guide said Busch ... I didn't pay attention which one. After I had booked the hotel, I had emailed the customer service rep and had asked if we can have a room with a view of the lake because we were going to be in town celebrating my husband's birthday. She emailed me back saying that we would be upgraded to a room with a view and when we got there, the view of the lake was partial and really disappointing. Anyway! If you get a good deal, stay there, otherwise try to get a hotel on or off Michigan ave, if prices are similar!;4;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

The breakfast that they supply for preferred guests is quite good and their fitness center is impressive with its glassed in panoramic views of the city and lake. The staff was cordial and very helpful, although some people at the front office lost a cheesecake of mine (long story, it was from Eli's though!). A great hotel for the business traveler because of the location and amenities offered. The bar and lobby area are very nice but as with all hotel bars, very overpriced ($11 for a well vodka).

1512;12/30/2009;NL9jqvS;A8pZPcS2uhtoTL626uccIQ;okay, it's a pretty hotel.  pretty pricey though and for what reason?  i caught on right away - we were paying for all the pretty things!  last year i had a free hotel stay at a much better hotel (embassy suites) and i decided that me and my guy would have an annual pre-christmas local getaway from now on.  the sheraton seemed like a good idea at the time, but in fact it was not. the bed was the best thing about our stay - very comfortable, no complaints.   the room was clean.  but there was evidence of wear and tear.  i expect that if i'm paying a higher price i get better quality.  not so here. location is decent also if you're a fan of looking at the river.  although michigan avenue is a couple blocks away the hotel's location doesn't make you feel like it is accessible.  it's in a crazy little spot. i do NOT recommend eating in the lb bistro - way too expensive.  we paid $25/person for the breakfast "buffet" and it was nothing more than a regular buffet set up in a "fancy" way, and a "fancy" chef who makes omelets and scrambles eggs.  the food was not even that great.  i don't mind paying $25 for food that tastes great.  but this was not great food. also, there is a shuttle that will take you to macy's - on state or michigan.  this was not well advertised.  i found out by accident when going to catch a taxi and another guest informed me of the shuttle. all in all it wasn't the worst place to stay, but for the money spent i would NOT do it again, not at this sheraton.;2;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1513;5/7/2008;mPLsJ0iGBiP3Tep6ow0gbg;t_I1RMxZPO3JJtuklubUZA;I am surprised that nobody has mentioned this: the Sheraton Chicago is the stingiest hotel I have ever encountered.  There are lots of hidden fees.  Let me count the ways in which you are charged and taxed for every small item. --there is a continental breakfast available on the 33rd floor.  However, it is only for "club members" though this is not made clear to you.  After you sit down with your coffee and bagel, you are given a scrip of paper to sign which states that you will be charged 19 bucks plus 18 percent tip for a continental breakfast.  WTF?  You would much be better served to go across the black to the NBC building, rather than this overpriced bagel shop. --The POOL costs money.  Huh?  a 300 dollar hotel room won't pay for your pool?  This is too cheap for my tastes.  Otherwise it costs 12 bucks a day or 20 bucks for your entire stay to dip in the the not-so-olympic sized pool.  Instead, I took a hot bath.  In my quickie tour I didn't see a spa or a hot tub either. --The restaurants are overpriced.  My girlfriend and I at the "Chi Bar" and the drinks were about 12 bucks for a Mojito.  I got a screwdriver with the house vodka for 10 bucks.  Huh?  The drinks at the top of the Hancock Tower, where at least the view is remarkable was only a dollar more per drink.  For a small glass of orange juice and smirnoff vodka 10 bucks just ain't right. --The hotel room itself was tiny tiny tiny.  Evidently our company footed the bill on the room, so we didn't care too much about the 300 dollar price tag, but the room was not very big at all. --the TV gives you about 24 channels.  Ok, whatever, but the annoying thing is that if you turn the tv off then turn it back on, the channel is switched to the continuous Sheraton informercial, which is a peeve. --Another small charge: starbucks coffee cups and a small coffee maker are on the desk next to the bed, far away from the mini bar.  However, these cups of coffee cost 3 bucks a piece.  Is ANYTHING included in the 300 dollar hotel tag?  What will Sheraton do in the future, charge us each time they clean the sheets?  My god. --Another thing: it is cheaper to take a taxis than the hotel shuttle.  Yup, they charge for that as well.  They want you so bad that they charge you 27 bucks each way to ride in a van with uncomfortable seats crowded with other suits.  The van concierge actually told me and my girlfriend to take a taxi, and not their own hotel service, and for that he did us a big favor. To recap: at Sheraton, everything has a price tag, and if you can waste money, then this place will gobble it up.  However, if you want a luxury hotel room, then don't go here.  Your 300 dollars will not give you anything more than a bed to sleep on. So basically, the experience that you get as a customer at this not fine establishment is that they are out to make the quick buck on you, not to provide you with comfort.  Hidden fees and charges are not cool, and a 300 dollar price tag needs to include more than a bed and sheets.  I have been to model 6's with more service.;1;2;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

1515;8/26/2008;N1SZTkz3HPtbhZdXL0efJQ;sM-eevGF9YOtgVSLGZiRzA;The Sheraton Chicago is a great hotel. It's in a great location on the Chicago River blocks away from Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, CTA stations, Grant Park, and much more. You walk in and are greeted to an impressive, expansive lobby. Heading upstairs, we arrived in a clean, updated hotel room. There was a HD LCD TV! On top of that, there was a great view down the Chicago River towards the new Trump Tower. The only complaint I had was the plumbing, which is the reason this is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review. Upon using the bathroom, the sink wouldn't drain and the toilet was acting strange. But once we got the staff up there, everything went smoothly from there on. Back to the lobby. We were told upon check in about the Microsoft Surface tables in the lobby. There are two of them. We were told that the Sheraton Chicago was one of five hotels to have them in the country. I can tell you, they're pretty much awesome, and I don't even like Microsoft. The interface is a little clunky, but it's pretty cool to listen to their catalog of music and discover a little bit about what to do in the city of Chicago on a touchscreen computer built into a coffee table! Be warned though, it wasn't until just before we left that I got to try one out. They're extremely popular. Moving on, there are five restaurants/bars in the hotel, including Shula's Steakhouse and the Java Bar, which serves Starbucks. Shula's has an excellent buffet. For $20, you can have an awesome selection of food, ranging from smoked salmon to bagels to deconstructed parfaits to pastries to pancakes to omelets and everything in between. The steakhouse has a great atmosphere too, although I never had lunch or dinner there. Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful and took care of everything we needed. Overall, if you're looking for a great hotel to stay at in Chicago at a moderate price, the Sheraton is what you're looking for.;4;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw

1518;12/17/2008;y1NUBETs24JSNRIsXhbDZw;5IPVH8EOsweEt8WE_WhO_A;I stayed here and thankfully I pricelined this place for a fraction of the price. This is a huge convention hotel and if you like crowds or thongs of families and kids, or teenagers attending an event then this is your hotel.  It looks like they put ALL their money into the lobby and elevator banks on the main level. Look carefully at the doors on your floor, they are 2 shades of brown! Oh and the bathrooms have clearly seen better days. I would be upset if I spent $200 a night to stay here. The room (at least mine) had a very dark, masculine feel. They charge you $12.95 a day for the internet here and you cannot get a wireless signal so don't even think about it. New LG LCDs are in the room and a decent cable assortment made this stay tolerable. They did put out hot cider and fresh cookies twice while I stayed here which was a nice touch since it was about 10 degrees outside, but thats winter in Chicago. Everyone says this location is off the beaten path...it really isn't unless you are a typical lazy american but I could see how walking back at night could be troubling to some as its a bit empty. All in all, an OK experience. Oh the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed was comfy, room clean so no complaints on that.;3;0;0;0;ezxzzWj-EIigt0p4wlbLbw
1519;9/23/2012;Wf-7bJszS2n6REXGbrwK2w;GXfrchFxdldoJXSEqUcdNw;Overall, I think I'm less and less a fan of the W concept. This hotel has both good and bad. The rooms are very updated and comfortable, but- the soundproofing stinks. Had to swicth rooms and still was awakended by noise the next morning. The staff is very friendly, but- they are so friendly it takes them forever to check you in, so the folks behind you get to wait. The location next to the lake is great, especially if you have a lakeview, but- it's also far from everything else, with few amenities in immediate walking distance. Probably will hit up the Westin on my next stay. But if you're in the mood for the hipster scene, this might be your place to stay.;3;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1520;8/6/2012;E1j78xcwMYnymNRlfse-EQ;b0Rd7efrtg4bTNFzjqegOw;You cannot go wrong with a W Hotel. It is stylish, fancy, cool, chic, all in one. In addition, it is in a great location in Chicago, overlooking Lake Michigan. The hotel itself counts with a great swimming pool, excellent fitness facilities and a great restaurant in the lobby. While most of front desk's staff is very friendly, there were occasions that I had to deal with arrogant ones, as if we were doing a favor in staying at the hotel. One last reason for not receiving a five-star is that, on some occasions that I had stayed there, the floor of the room would be wet or the internet would be extremely slow that I would just give up using it altogether. All in all, it is a great hotel. With its brand, we would expect nothing but perfection. That is why, a five-star is not granted just yet.;4;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1523;8/15/2012;jJzUEbNzqMG3knGxjLrj1A;BopL_9NwW6I5_9NjfeXCzA;I'm definitely a fan of W Hotels, but I can't say this location is one of my fav's!  As other's have mentioned, the retro-fit was poorly done and it's especially noticeable when it comes to their heating or air-conditioning.  The rooms have a tough time keeping a consistent temperature, and the hallways are either overly warm or overly cold.  Tough to find common ground. The bright side is, service doesn't get much better.  There's nothing this hotel won't do to help make your stay more enjoyable.  From great restaurant recommendations to driving you in the Acura Experience.  (which btw, is very common among W Hotels). So it's really a toss up for me....the the prices the command, I really don't believe there's room for imperfection.  As a matter of fact, try ordering a bottle to the room, and you'll probably fall off your chair - $250 bottle, $3.50 delivery, $51 bottle service, and $26 tax....WTF!!!!   are you serious!!!??? As for location, there's a great lake view, you're right by Navy Pier, and you're about 3 blocks (long blocks though) from Michigan (Magnificent Mile).  So while I'd agree there isn't all that much within the immediate block of this hotel, there are many options if you walk a few blocks. It's a toss up for me....but I think they'll have trouble getting my business again.....too many choices in the great City of Chicago to be paying top dollar and receive sub-par value.  Just my opinion.;3;1;1;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1525;6/22/2012;hQDOiV-HjEB1XhChjzR2iA;egDymReIGgB2USiHWVSASw;This W has a fair amount of pros and cons for me. Pros - great views of Lake Michigan, clean rooms, fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon, Fonte coffee in the morning, very helpful concierge, decent sized gym. Cons - Not ideal for business travel since it is kinda far from everything business (and also a hike from the El), very poor a/c in the lobby/common areas/elevators.  I was there this past week when it was in the mid-90's and it was absolutely unbearable outside of the actual guest room. There is a nice lobby bar, which gets a decent amount of action at night but other than that, there is not too much within a short walking distance of this W.  On the other hand, cabs are easily accessible.;3;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

We headed to Chicago for a smaller family vacation, only taking us an hour to get from the northern suburbs to Chicago, Perfect location!! The also give you Bliss prouducts, which smell very good. Now onto the bad side.... We found cut toenails on the floor of our hotel, I was thinking maybe even the cleaning ladies didn't want to clean it up so they left it there. That was on our first night so we were not pleased. They charge you for calling out of your room, and DOWN THE STREET. not happy about that either.

1529;1/12/2012;EbuqwbBYq63TyulTrJqa1Q;y_396J28M_dTH3-sen2DVQ;Looked at this hotel for our wedding venue. The ballroom has amazing views - Navy Pier, the Lake, the City lights. We almost booked it strictly for the Saturday Night Firework Show that we would have just for our wedding (not the rest of the city of Chicago). :) The reason we didn't book here was just that the room was too dark and a little on the small side. We were told we could fit our 150 guests but just didn't feel like it would work. And we would have needed to invest in a lot of rentals (linens, chair covers, and draperies) to brighten up the space to fit our look/feel. Would definitely recommend this ballroom for anyone looking for a modern, city, stylish, and intimate wedding reception.;4;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1530;12/27/2011;QyZQpwn6t31pOg9SSyO13Q;_0L4WNYQ6f6y6pMYzJ3b9Q;First time staying @ a W and if they are all like this one, probably the last. Booked a 2 night stay here over the holidays to take advantage of their indoor pool and take the family out to downtown restaurants for a change. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom.  Unlike the Renaissance on Wacker which has 2 queen size beds and plenty of room, this place can only squeeze in two doubles and barely leave enough room to move around.  It's so bad, that they do not even have a luggage rack: no place to put it.  So basically you put your suitcase on a shelf just below where all your clothes would hand in their wall mounted organizer. The bathroom also lacks a real door.  We had a sliding bamboo door and shutters. I shit you not!  There are wooden shutters in a wall separating the main room from the bathroom. Front desk service here is a hit or miss as well.  Checking in, I said I did not have my Starwood card with me.  In most places they volunteer to look it up or provide some guidance to earn points after the fact.  Not here, she just ignored me.  Not a big deal, as I seldom stay @ Starwood properties:prefer Marriott and Hilton brands. Parking here is $53 a night, which is steep even by downtown standards.  If you are heading to Navy Pier, the location is great.  If you want Michigan Ave or the many restaurants 100E-500W, then you have a nice hike ahead of you.;2;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1534;12/28/2011;x9AGXAW2-aaNBbrkV;x_axtCj_KMcWdf1WQ6BbdQ;3 separate stays here. I am a fan! Check in: I actually am a fan of the subtle vanilla/botanical scent that welcomes you when you walk into a starwood hotel. The staff are friendly and they do recognize the fact that you have stayed with them before. They always have room rates which includes valet parking ($53/night with in/out privileges) and 2 free drinks at the lobby bar (and it's not just well drinks. They do include top shelf). Room: Very clean. There is a day-bed looking furniture for lounging. The desk area isn't my favorite as it's not quite functional.. but if I was travelling for pleasure, it wouldn't matter much to me. They do offer 500 SPG points for foregoing daily cleaning service.  Internet costs $.  Also- there is an open panel between the bedroom and the bathroom. You can get your privacy by closing the wooden shutters. It's visual proof, but not soundproof. If you're there with someone you're not too comfortable with, you might want to look for another hotel. Business center: it's called "wired"... It costs $$ just to sign onto a computer. Printing service also costs $$... Not ideal... Lobby bar: staff is okay. About $14 for johnnie walker black, plus $2 for ice! I find it ridiculous... but thanks to my free drink vouchers, I only had to pay gratuity. Lobby restaurant: Limited menu with small plates. Scallops are EXCELLENT! a little salty, but wonderful... And the truffle fries are to die for. Coffee: there is a small coffee station in the lobby every morning. Nothing too spectacular... But there is a starbucks a block away from the hotel. Call down to valet to get the car, walk down to get coffee and you'll be good to go by the time you get back.;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

I have been coming to this hotel since 2005, and have only high praise for the entire staff and the complete guest experience here. Some of the highlights: The valets that assist you on arrival (and greet you by name after the first time they hear it), and come find you when your car service arrives outside. Front Desk staff with exceptionally welcoming attitude, demeanor, and helpfulness. +1 for being able and willing to accommodate and change my rooms when I found loud air conditioners or neighbours with barking dogs upon arrival. +1 again for being able and willing to work with me when I needed to cut short my stay due to a hurricane bearing down on my home. A concierge desk that I can happily blame for helping me put on about 10 pounds due to extraordinary restaurants recommended to me during my stays. Most impressive was their willingness to research matters that they didn't know off the top of their heads, and get back to me shortly thereafter. Whatever/Whenever staff that actually respond to orders submitted via the iPhone app (other W Hotels please take note!). I usually "make a green choice", and whenever I've needed things in my room restocked, W/W are very much on top of their game. Great bartenders in the downstairs lounge. I usually only expect my local bar to know what to pour me when I walk in, but after two days, the Living Room had my orders at a glance. Good bar nibbles as well as proper meals on the premises. The high-floor views are unparalleled, but go to Whiskey Sky for the fireworks shows. I know part of it is SPG recognition (some years I'm Gold, some years I'm Plat), but all in all it seems to be the way they do business, and very few other hotels compare.  I've strayed to other hotels in Chicago just to see what's out there, which has only served to remind me to come back "home" to the W Lakeshore.;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

The W Chicago - Lakeshore is another great property.  Service is tip top - and that is what is important.  Check-in is always a breeze, everyone always offering to help.  Going to the Bliss Spa is a great way to spend an afternoon.  And having a drink in the Living Room people watching is a great activity. I ordered room service on a Saturday night from my iPhone using the W Hotel App, and the meals were delivered so fast I thought at first this must be an order for another room.  (Use the W app - great to get things sent up to your room right away!) Like most W's, the hotel was a rehab project - i remember staying in this hotel when it was a Days Inn many moons ago.  The "shutters" in the bathroom take some getting used to if you have not seen them previously, but it adds to the quirkiness that I love about this place.  The beds are great to sleep in - great view of Lake Michigan - a great pool on the 8th floor - I could go on and on and on. It is a great location.  But note folks - this is a W - make sure you do your homework and understand what a W hotel is like.  Whimsical.  Whatever.  Whenever.  This isn't a stuffy old traditional property - the Ws have a theme and attitude that I am guessing many of the other reviewers misunderstood...;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

The rooms are a good size with plenty of storage space for suitcases. They have bliss products and a well stocked bathroom. The only thing that was a little weird was the shutters on the bathroom. Other than that, the rooms are stylish and relaxing. You can have a city view with Sears Tower or the Navy Pier and Lake Michigan. They have complimentary cookies, water, and apples in the lobby and you can sign up to use an Acura if you need to get around town. The only drawback is it does get pretty packed at night with the bar/club or if there are events going on upstairs. The lobby can get crowded and the elevators can get pretty full.

Spots also fill up fast, so make sure to book at least a few hours ahead.  To use it, you have to go by their schedule.  We only got to use it once.  The entire "experience" is a sales pitch.  Not that I care cuz its a free ride, but just sayiinnn.. -Okay guys, those bathroom windows into the room are not THAT weird. -Love the bliss products in the bathroom!;3;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1540;11/3/2011;wxfgopuQejwJVxIr0ISh5g;x0BmKrUesHgnNO31rVIZ4Q;The service at the w is the worst. Checking in no porter or bell man. Checked in at the front desk and told the lady. She said would you like help with your bags. I said absolutely and told her no one was out front to help. Waited. No one shows up. I take them myself. Concierge is totally unhelpful and completely overwhelmed. The front desk, they live here but don't know where anything is. I just travel advisor it or google map it. Unreal. The wave restaurant is opposite. Food is delicious and service is excellent!!! Checking out, waited 25 minutes for luggage assistance and guess what no one shows up and again I take it downstairs myself. I tell the front desk again. They say they'll send someone up and again I bring the luggage down myself. Worst service in this hotel.;2;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1542;6/17/2011;ur-kfLlYUhsI56Z62iGp8Q;C9cFMxkQMjKKeY4Tkrcczw;Location is probably the only thing key about the W Chicago. I didn't have a BAD experience, but it was none the less that great either. I was a little peeved knowing I would be charged $14.95 a day for internet service in my room, for how much it cost to stay here, you'd think it would be complimentary. The bathrooms are another story, I really would like to meet the designer and pick his/her brain over the concept! They are ridiculous and not "edgy" or "modern" or whatever term you want to call it. W Chicago isn't our normal hotel we stay at while on business in Chicago, but we will definitely not be booking here again.;3;1;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1547;11/20/2010;XmByjsS3S1-;YnyguOkiSAeF4EwKJ4TAVA;I loved this hotel! It was walking distance to the Navy Pier and it was surprisingly cheap. I stayed here during the week for work and it was well worth the price. The room was great - nice flat screen hotel, bliss products, comfy robe. I also loved the decorations! I had a bunch a boxes shipped to the hotel for a tradeshow I was in town to attend and they did not charge any extra for receiving them (many hotels do this and they charge by weight). All of the staff was extremely friendly. When I am here next year I will be sure to book here!;4;2;2;1;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1548;3/30/2007;G9XLqeVilpHDe8Y73jAHHw;G5LXEaxhQMF_BVjNHkVr7g;Now this is what a hotel experience should be about. When I checked in, Front Desk Jen asked me about my flight and taxi ride in, had my room all ready. And the room itself was terrific - king-size bed, a plasma tv, nice modern accents, and slick shower, complete with Bliss Spa bath products. I had wake-up calls scheduled each morning I was in town, and the person who called each time was soothing and polite, so a nice way to start each day. Oh, when I did get to my room, about 20 minutes into it, Jen called to inquire if I needed anything. I actually didn't get a chance to really enjoy the bar but it seems more of a scene at happy hour than at night, but that could have been because I was there on a Wednesday and Thursday. Still, as with all the Ws I've been to around the US, the bar and lounge were typically sleek and playful, sort of like something out of a Jonathan Adler catalog. Since I took cabs (always plentiful outside), I didn't get to really explore the walking area around the hotel, so I can't comment on location, save for the fact that wherever I went around town, my fare was always under $10. All in all, I'd easily recommend this W for a stay, whether you're a tourist or business traveler, heck even a weary local who wants a bit of style and fun. Note: I booked my room via Expedia, and got a super deal since I also made flight plans with them.;5;9;6;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Comfy rooms Good service Location.  You're right on the lake, which provides some beautiful views, especially from the Bliss Spa. THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Location.  What with it being on the lake, it's a bit hard to get to places.  Not impossible, as there are always cabs out front, but not as easy as other hotels in the city, either.;4;3;3;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Waterfront view, humid weather with a nice breeze, and staying over on a street-fair weekend was a WONDERFUL time.. While the W in Seattle is by far my favorite one - (I am biased for family reasons) - I have to say that the concierge (5 Big and Bright stars) at this hotel really know how to treat you right.   R & I had a great weekend, slept amazingly well, and felt right at home with the fun times we had and hopefully we'll come back next year for 'Taste of Chicago!';4;4;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1551;4/18/2011;ydSj0QoyKQYSYtZOmD0-WA;KdOifP5NyKBapw0hnV8a0g;I was so surprised to see all the negative reviews of this place because I loved my recent weekend stay here. Yes - W hotels are awfully pretentious sometimes and honestly, it's not the type of hotel that I normally stay at. But I had some starpoints and it was a weekend mini-vacation in Chicago so I decided to try something out of the norm. I got upgraded to a suite on the 30th floor and the view was AMAZING. I personally loved our room...everything from the half bath by the entrance to the decor and even the window in the bathroom (but yes agreed with other reviewers - if I wasn't traveling alone or with family, it might be slightly weird). The service was decent - not bad, but also nothing extraordinarily amazing. I never got a chance to take advantage of their Acura service where they drive you anywhere within a 5 mile radius, but it seems like a great way to get around, especially since this hotel is not particularly close to anything. Quick walk to Navy Pier, but you're going to have to walk a few blocks before you get to anything of substance (Magnificent Mile, public transportation, etc) - that was my only complaint. Overall though, awesome weekend here. I would definitely recommend this W location over the City Center location.;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1552;6/5/2007;kN;DP1xl_8YgyH6rVm2AEBOrg;It is dark in the hallways, dark in the rooms. I understand the point of trying to be trendy, but I kind of like the idea of seeing if the room is clean or not.  This former Days Inn, next to a construction site for the next year btw, has small rooms and a bar that pretends to be trendy. W was hot in the early part of this century, but seems more vegas than anything else. Too many other hotels in Chicago that are better than this one.;2;3;1;1;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1554;9/19/2010;UnsTSwPEqkc1JPMmnaUiZg;kW2dk1CWihmh3g7k9N2G8A;Why does Chicago get the most unhappening W lobby-bar? Most other W hotels nationwide you walk into and the lobby is a vibrant, cool, sexy, happening bar/lounge on weekend nights. This one just isn't. The music was really good, but the atmosphere was amiss. It closes around 1AM. We went upstairs to the bar/lounge and that was as unhappening and unexciting on a Friday night. They started shutdown mode at 1:30AM.;3;2;1;1;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1555;11/30/2009;V6uDoHjc3zhYodb-wwr1fw;1NhcboU6heGfgzXcmJQx0Q;Really my rating is between a 3 and 4. Once again, we got lucky, and booked this hotel on Priceline for $82. So for the price that we got it for, I should rate them 5 stars. However, if I had to pay $300 for this room, the same price at Swissotel, I would probably give it 2.5 or 3 stars. The design of the hotel is cool and contemporary (browns/lavendars/grays), very West Elm-ish. We asked for a room on a higher floor, which they accommodated, but the view was not of the lake or Navy Pier. Night view was nice because during the holidays, Chicago decorates streets with lights, but during the day, the view is of  other people's condos and parking lot. We had 1 window instead of 5. I was most impressed with the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and liquid facial soap from Bliss (famous brand for spa located in NY, Chicago and LA -- probably elsewhere too). Really liked the quality of shampoo and conditioner. But, we didn't get bar soap to wash hands (but they do have soap dish). I had to use facial liquid soap just to wash hands (slight inconvenience). No bathtub either (not that I wanted to take a bath or anything). Shower was nice, but Swissotel offered both. The bathroom shelf where Bliss products looked mildly dusty [ : \ ] The "W" experience was more about selling stuff. They had Bruce Mau book on spectators and a "W" book that sells brands and products. Cover was kind of cool (looks like fishnet), but book looked kind of old. I flipped through it anyways. I did like how they labelled the price for water ($6 for Fuji water). So if you are a hipster, this hotel might be for you, but I prefer to pay and extra $20 for Swissotel. This hotel experience was comparable to a knock-off of André Balazs' Standard Hotel chains, but not as hip. Maybe comparable to the newly renovated Flamingo Hotel in Vegas, but not as new and more expensive (and in different hue -- Flamingo: pink/red/fuchsia theme).;3;2;2;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1557;12/21/2010;-42xQq;ptMdIKBB4CyH9uPWwU9WJg;As far as W's go this hotel is nice. Most W's are old hotels that they "renovated" with purple lights, techno music, and a giant W. The hotel feels like a real W. Try to get a room with a view of the lake. The room service is also very good and if you have status you'll get a nice box of white chocolate whoppers. WARNING - For business travelers there's a very long line to get a cab. It can take as long as 45 minutes so make sure to plan accordingly.;4;1;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1558;8/2/2007;i4bdA3S-ITSeRruiMd7bXQ;dhuWV1YmyMhjCTS4bh1uoA;Located on Lakeshore drive and directly across the lake, the outdoor patio and rocking chairs have an awesome view. It's absolutely relaxing. Everything about the W is super chic. There are awesome bamboo chairs in the reception area. The bar/restaurant, Wave, has comfy chairs and a bigger area in the back where you can lounge comfortably. The drinks were super yummmmmy! The Wave-jitos was refreshing, but the bloody mary was my favorite - it was light and tasty. We also got some side dishes: broccolini and truffled risotto. It took a long time and I ended up scarfing down a lot of the garlic/cheese crackers. The room layout is a typical hotel room, but the small touches makes it special. I love bathrooms and this one especially! There's a window that looks directly into the rest of the room (yes, there are shades so if you have friends over, you can do your business in private) and a sliding door. The shower doesn't have a door and there's a rain type shower head. The Bliss fab six sits on the shelf along with a robe. There's a mini bar and safe and a LED TV. You have the option of a wake up call or using their wake-up CD in the alarm clock provided. My room was on the 31st floor, you have to slide your key in the elevator in order to go up and when we got to my floor, we noticed a telescope next to the window in the lobby. Heeheee.... peeping time! We checked out all the people in boats in the lake. Fun times! Lastly, the staff is super friendly and very helpful. Definitely a good hotel choice. OH and there's a Bliss spa in the lobby... what else can you ask for?;5;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1559;12/9/2010;RuLYlPKB9KGfX;urhy2vLd0VWRPz9D3JAYMA;I'm giving this W three stars for their stellar service only! Otherwise...bleh... I will echo the sentiments of other yelpers. Walking into the lobby, you're faced with the familiar look and feel of the W chain but upon closer inspection, the hotel appeared run down and not up to par for the brand. Rushed renovation or bad maintenance? As I mentioned before, the customer service here is excellent!. As was the food in the restaurant. I think it's called Wave. Anyhow, the staff at Bliss were also very nice and extremely accommodating. I would stay here again just for that. On the flip-side, who would want to stay in a nice hotel with bad service? A plus is the location and view of Lake Michigan. I just hope they spruce up a bit if I ever return.;3;1;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

Seriously...I think a lot of people had to approve this idea and I have to wonder what they were thinking or if they were at all.

When I arrived for check-in, there was a mob in the lobby.  I had made my reservations weeks in advance and was given a check in time of 3pm, yet my room was not ready until nearly 5:30!  It seemed that a lot of people had the same dilemma as we all crammed together sipping complimentary tea and champagne that the staffers provided to keep us calm. In the meantime, I had a massage at the Bliss Spa on the upper floor, which was very nice. When I finally got to the room, it was nice and warm and had new-age chill-out music playing. Did I mention that this new-age chill-out music plays everywhere , 24/7 at the W? It can become more grating than calming. The room had a great view, the beds were comfy and the bathroom was cool and well stocked with Bliss spa products. Had I been staying with multiple people the shuttered window to the bathroom might not have given enough privacy. I didn't have room service because it was pretty pricey, but I guess that's the point! Overall, W is a nice, hip place to stay. One star off for the check-in flub.;4;1;1;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

The W Chicago Lakeshore is located right on Lake Michican (well, across the street  from it) and has the typical W feel and vibe. It appears as if this was an older property that was converted into a W Hotel a while back. Not the coolest or newest of W properties that I've stayed at, but when I'm back in Chicago I'll stay at the W Chicago Lakeshore again (or check out its sister property, W City Center).;3;1;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1567;10/11/2006;tGf9-;b1ywmik7wy2Zn9fO8DpkZw;My recent stay at this hotel was *terrible*.  The hallways were dirty, the room was in terrible disrepair, with paint chipped on the tables, threads hanging loose on the lampshades, the headboard falling off the wall, and dust on the desk supplies.  The room as a whole was small and cave-like. The worst experience though, was with the staff, one of whom tried to enter the room while I had the "do not disturb" sign up.

1569;12/31/2011;bZD6CG5xHcqRbjCYzaVUlA;iCDk_fAzeJqKky60oaVmhA;My fiance and I stayed at The W for one night this week, and we were astounded at the type of hospitality you are provided with for how much you pay for stay there. The lobby is gorgeous, and has a relaxing atmosphere. Checking in was pretty easy. The woman at the front desk was very eager to answer any and all questions we had about our stay. Now for the bad. The room we were provided with was absolute junk. The door to the room would not shut unless two people applied their entire body weight to it. The same goes for the bathroom "door." It is made of some sort of mock-bamboo material, and ours just did not want to close, even when the two of us tried. At first glance, the bathroom itself looks very nice. However, it gets about one star from me, because there is no functionality to it what so ever. The "bamboo" shutters is by far the worst thing about the room as a whole. You have the ability to shut them, but that does not mask any sounds coming from the bathroom. I love my fiance, but not enough to listen to his every move while using the toilet. The bed sheets in this room were filthy. Stains of God knows what were all over the place when we attempted to take a nap before heading out on the town. That is when we had enough. We requested a different room at the front desk, and were given one with no hassle at all. The door to the new room was completely functional, as was the one to the bathroom. However, there were cracks in the ceiling and while we were sleeping, bits of plaster would fall on to our faces. The temperature of the room is almost impossible to get right, you are either freezing cold, or sweating through your clothes. The shower was horrible in both rooms. Very pretty looking, but when in use, it gets water all over the floor since there is only half of a "door" and no curtain. The knob on our shower was also broken, so it took about 15 minutes for us to turn it on. All in all, the W was beautiful on the outside, but for what you are paying, it is definitely not worth it. At $53 a night for parking alone, I would be much more satisfied staying at a Hilton or even a Holiday Inn.;3;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1570;8/21/2009;6n--mR54GaFQ1Xvy8NLIEA;CCKML4USVheAi8ixPVIqgQ;We stayed at the W last weekend. This was the weekend of the air and water show. The W was the perfect location. The lobby of this hotel is awesome it makes you feel like you are on a beach vacation and not in Chicago. The restaurant is good and not too overpriced. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is great! We didn't have a view of the lake but the views are amazing because you can see them from the hotel pool and observation deck. We arrived early on Sunday and they allowed us an early check in w/ no problem and a late check out the next day. On  Monday morning I had just missed breakfast by 5 minutes. The waiter asked the chef to make an exception and he did. I did not have to ask him to do this he just did it.  The service was flawless. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Also the hotel is on the lake and only 5 blocks from Michigan Avenue and a 10 minute walk to Navy pier.;5;1;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

The boyfriend and I had a late Valentine's Day celebration here by renting a room (staycation i guess? too bad I detest that word). The hotel definitely has unique design, very suave, fun, and modern. Our room was a "Spectacular" room with a view of the lakefront. Too bad it was a usual gloom and doom foggy Chicago night. Got drinks at Whiskey Sky on the 33rd floor. Very small, great drinks - would have liked a better view of the city (the view isn't bad, it just can be hard to see it without kneeling on the couch - at least if you're 5'2). Only complaints/notes 1) Parking - $48 for overnight valet parking. Good lord. We just parked on the street a few blocks away and paid like $10 in meter parking. 2) Let it be known that if you are a very private person when it comes to using the bathroom, this might be rough for you. There's a sliding door, but there are also cafe windows into the bathroom that don't *fully* close. Otherwise, absolutely love and recommend this place.

I stay at many W's around the country, and here, the rooms had are pretty standard, fairly good sized bathroom, rainwater shower and a great daybed. I was on the 32nd and my room had a great view of the Navy pier. They also have telescopes by the elevators for viewing. My flight home was cancelled and I had to stay an extra night in Chicago, so I moved to from the City Center to the Lakeshore - HUGE difference. If you want to pick an SPG property in Chicago I'd pick this. Also they have a cool top-floor bar (Whisky Sky) which has a nice view over the city and some solid drinks. Carly took care of me :);3;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1574;12/17/2009;7XX6NUh2uB9-YtC3bp0Siw;E9xYJMx9qEpr5JKzFFjh8Q;Best room views in the whole city! I travel to Chicago often and this is the first place I look at to stay! The "Lake View" rooms are stunning! I can not stop using exclamation points when reviewing this hotel, that's how much I love it! I love the design of the the bathrooms with the window that opens to give more space to the whole room. I'm not a very demanding guest, so I don't make the staff jump through hoops and then complain about horrible service on here when I don't get my way. The location is great for the views, but not nessacerely for getting to public transportation. Cabs are always available, though if you have a car, expect to pay $50 a day for parking. The bar on the 30-something'ish floor is less to be desired. It's just a very dark room with a view over looking the city. This is Chicago! There are plenty of bars every where! I love this place! Have I mentioned that? :);5;0;1;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1575;5/6/2008;DDQzuWO;iZ3QbF0AyeUY8T9BGg1u7w;I have a love hate relationship with this place.  I went there last year to catch up with a good buddy.  He ended up paying with his frequent flyer miles which was good because apparently this place costs a mint. Good:   Beds.  They are amazingly fantastic.  I haven't had that good of a night's sleep since.   Water.  The showers are awesome and the bath room pretty cool. TV.  Great HD tv with this hypnotic trace music set to soothing visuals when you first turn it on. Bartender.  The upstairs bartender was possibly the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.   Bad: Pretentious.  Pretentious.  Pretentious.  They turn the lobby into a mock night club with a live DJ at night.  If you're not wearing clothes they consider appropriate, you'll be asked to leave.  Its a god damned hotel lobby?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?  As a guest, I should not feel awkward about being in the lobby of the hotel I'm staying at.  Not only that, but the bouncer was incredibly rude about it.  Saying anything like, "We get sports and movie stars in here all the time and they can't wear their hats either." is not cool what so ever.  You're a bouncer.  . . GFY. Generally the staff did not look interested in being helpful and had more important things to do than express interest looking after this guest.  Don't judge a book by its cover people. . . Funny Anecdote- As I was leaving, I noticed a huge tour bus parked outside.  I didn't think anything of it until I got a call from my buddy.  Apparently I was leaving just as Snoop and 50 Cent were on their way in.  If I had known that, I would have stayed another night. . . I'll give'em that as a plus.;3;0;0;1;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1576;12/17/2010;acebit3QGPRW1gD-VoqFCg;vin_pKd2cz0wDKLYGCr_Aw;I attended a corporate event here and had a good time. However, the prices should NOT just be about location. The W seems to be an old, rundown hotel they took and tried to gussy up. My friends' room had scuff marks on the walls, cheap wood (or press board?) paneling nailed to one wall, and it was TINY. The bathrooms have a window, which is not only weird, but provide NO sound barrier. Pretty awkward, depending on who you're staying with. The shower heads are low and her husband almost wasn't able to fit under them! The bamboo blinds were also filthy. When you enter the room, you are greeted with a basket of goodies. Wow! Now, this helps to explain the $300ish for a crap room rates... or maybe not. We soon realized that next to this basket of "goodies" was a price list. An individual can of Pringles? $5! You can also buy 3 or 4 condoms for $12 and a "Take me Away" CD for $13. Wow. sexy, huh? Not really. Oh- and if you want anything that isn't in your room (towels, food, etc.) it's a $3.50 DELIVERY CHARGE and a 20% service fee. Wow. The 33rd floor (I believe it's called the Altitude Room?) is pretty nice, but the bathrooms have no main door. Again... awkward. The stones in the sink were pretty cool though, I have to admit. I would never, EVER pay to stay here, but people seem to like it. I guess when you have money to throw into the air at mediocre service and rooms, it's worth it.;2;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1577;2/29/2008;QrYS3IYBcYQV5IDO8VNCvQ;BWoIzHQKl9lyJSRYHxoMVw;Threw a b-day party here recently and reserved the space in the middle (b/t Wave restaurant and the lobby/reception area).  There was a minimum but we had about 35 people so didn't have any problem in obnoxiously exceeding that minimum.   The space looked exquisite....they totally set up the area with tons of candles and flowers and some minimal decor...it really looked spectacular !!  hats off to Sara D (W's event planner) for helping me put this together. We had two personal servers who pretty much took care of our every need.  Ordered several passed apps which were very tasty but mostly stuck to the drink.  She also let us bring in our own Champagne with no corkage fee for a toast...saved a few hundo right there, kudos to Sarah for that:-) Outside of this event, i've been on a few occasions for drinks as it's right next door to where I work....always a good time.;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1578;7/8/2010;QJRqyXUT3q9R9uFnbpMdXw;puS8HuNdeXhhl5F4bb0EEg;I love this hotel.  The big W outside the hotel made it for me and then some.  Altho our room was not overlooking the lake, we had a good view of downtown Chicago.   The room was pretty amazing and I love those plantation windows they have for the bathroom.  You can opt to open them if you are just doing your makeup while having to talk to whoever was with you in the room.  It was nice and different.  Even the bathroom door was not your usual door but a sliding one instead. The lobby bar/lounge was a comfort.  I ordered a sampler dessert and I didn't want to share it.  Drinks were okay.  I was also able to use the pool once, warm and big enough for laps.  They had threadmills and weights if you feel like working out. We made a good choice as this was walking distance to the Navy Pier.  We were able to make trips back and forth to the Pier, Michigan Ave etc. and our hotel very conveniently.  And it was close to almost everything. I'll stay at W again, anytime!;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1579;8/24/2007;BbAk6498FNiZTFSKwsO8Yg;GHcyvBgVV-F9s_hq2jWUNw;My favorite part of the W on Lake Shore?  The telescopes!  Outside the elevator banks on each floor is a telescope so that you can peek across at Lake Michigan, the beach, Navy Pier, the afterwork booze cruises that go by around 5:30 PM...such an awesome touch. I also like how the room design is much more "Midwestern chic" than any of the Ws in New York, with the wood paneling and shutters and whatnot.  The lobby decor is much quirkier than I would have expected, too (the only Ws I'm really familiar with are the heavy-on-the-charcoal-gray Times Square and Union Square, after all). I checked in right after the Horrible Apocalyptic Tornado Thunderstorms of '07 that had evacuated O'Hare's control tower, brought flights to a standstill, etc. and there was a chance I wouldn't be able to get in to check into my room.  So I called the W in advance and asked about the situation, and they were remarkably pleasant and accommodating: "We won't charge you if there are acts of God involved!"  Turns out I did get in, albeit around 1 AM, but the front desk team was still equally on top of things. There are only a few characteristically W-esque things that knock this down to four stars instead of five.  No free in-room Web access ($15/day) or coffee or whatnot -- I mean, really.  if they can give us holographic postcards, can't they at least have free Wi-Fi?;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1580;4/11/2010;y2dKS1ej3YsoAkvw4d3Y5g;-_gihqWuppoSHSR-qSbg5g;Located right on Lake Michigan with either great views of Navy Pier or the Chicago skyline, the rooms are modern and comfortable.

1581;4/7/2008;Z5F72aQZIexTW8hJAqgMkQ;W0TobKzkaqtOZpIe0CrENQ;I'm reviewing the bar/restaurant...Bliss on LSD. This is another cool place to meet for a date...The food is awesome but a bit pricey. Have something light like the raw tuna & avocado appetizer that comes in a martini glass..delicious.  Sit at the baby blue lit up bar and have a drink. If the weather is nice you can then move outside with your drink and date & sit in the cool wooden lounge chairs right off LSD and watch the sun set over the lake....really laid back.  People are upper class folks but friendly. And the best part...if the date goes well, you're inside a hotel:-) This is one of my favorite hotel bars around...doesn't have the feel of a hotel bar at all. **Edit: I went here again and they don't have the raw tuna/avocado appetizer anymore...I didn't know this but they change their menu almost weekly...this time they were going on a 'world' tour of foods, so they had all kinds of stuff from different countries. Still love this place. And I figured out that you can see into the men's bathroom and vise versa....they're connected by a see-through blue window.;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1582;5/12/2008;LeuzOJSBv2JMlK;7D_hSShIHD9MMFYGJCi8rg;Oh how I love the W. Have stayed here numerous times and have enjoyed every moment. Yes the rooms are small. But have you seen the view? We have been lucky enough to always get a lake view and it is just amazing. I have rearranged my schedule just so I could have a "hang out in the room" time in order to enjoy the bed. The sheets, the pillows...perfection. All but cured my sleeping problem. For that weekend anyway. I have frequented the bar in the lobby a few times, usually when I'm not staying there. It is sort of hit or miss. The drinks are always spot on, and it depends on the crowd. Sometimes there are the usual shiny guys in striped shirts and very tanned girls in tiny black tube dresses. Each to their own. Overall its usually a fun wind-down type of place. Oh and in nice weather, do check out the chairs outside. At night, with good friends, the Lake, a nice cocktail. Beautiful.;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

I have stayed here about 4 times . And I don't have anything negative to say about it . The rooms remind me of my own bedroom but the beds are much fluffier and cozy ....it's like sleeping on a cloud! The IPod dock was the best because I never leave home without the music. Loved the shower which was like raindrops.....sexxxy- Basically the whole setting makes you want to get close with the one you love to love  which is why me and my hunny are repeat offenders ....actually going this month;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1585;12/12/2009;6NyY8p3VOXC;vASaF47nWvCHEEDA8nfCVw;I was blown away by the negative reviews that this hotel has.   Yes, it was previously a Days Inn that just happened to be situated in between the prettiest waterfront in town AND the magnificent mile.  Yes, the glitter wall with the giant W at the driveway (which was very poorly designed, by the way) was very tacky, as were the (skankily dressed) non-hotel guests and visitors of the Living Room who loitered around the reception area on Friday and Saturday nights, making it almost impossible to navigate through the crowd and into the bank of elevators. As a side note - the vibe that I got from the lobby is very similar to that of the V Bar at Hotel Valencia, and the skankily dressed non-hotel guests and visitors remind me of San Jose's Santana Row's clientele: cougars on the prowl and 50-y.o dudes with 20-y.o golddigging arm candies.  Nothing beats the feel of home when you are a few thousand miles away. And I do think the attempt to put a "W" on anything and everything was a tad overdone.   But in all fairness, they did a good job transforming a dying and derelict Days Inn into a hip hangout joint. The cacophony stopped right there in the lobby.  I got the peace and quiet that I wanted in my room on level 20th, with an amazing view of the frosty Lake Michigan and Navy Pier.  The bed was comfortable (although the odd-looking soft black furry cube soon found its place on the floor), the toiletries are from the phenomenal Bliss Spa, and there was lots and lots of natural light.  I even like the window to the bathroom - although I don't know if I'd feel the same way if I wasn't traveling alone, since I'm not much of an exhibitionist. The service was consistently satisfactory.  Need a dental kit? Done - someone was already at the front door with an assortment of toothpaste / toothbrush / dental floss / mouthwash within 5 minutes.  Need a late check out? Done - 2PM.  Want more of those awesome Bliss toiletries (who doesn't love freebies)? Done - no questions asked. Lastly, those who complained about lack of proper storage system need to spend a week in a Manhattan hotel and then revisit their assessment. And oh, 9 out of 10 hotels charge for wi fi.  Get over it.;3;7;6;7;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1586;6/1/2008;X6r4Jw3WIR15886vI3L76g;VYn1YkB2drqWK-2nhc0IfA;Okay, I've stayed in some pretty run-down places, but come on W! I expected much more from a 5 star hotel than a window with shutters in the bathroom, that opened into the bedroom, right next to the bed! Who designed that? Were they thinking when they did that to the room? To the bathroom? A bathroom is a sanctuary of peace and private business doing, not a place where everyone and their mothers can hear and smell (sorry people!) everything you do! I can't tell you how many times my companions and I talked about using the facilities up stairs. COME ON! W, you are not what you claim to be. Oh, and did I mention the cycling air conditioning system?  It was loud and wouldn't turn off!  I was totally uncomfortable. Ugh, never again!!!!!!!;1;4;1;2;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1587;7/7/2009;pYF;oSY2YtgG_6J221LWGKn9nA;OK I am actually reviewing W Hotels in general--to date I've stayed at one in Montreal, New Orleans, Istanbul, and NYC. The rooms are always mod and interesting, the hotels are always done up in a theme that is somehow regional and each hotel has a bar or club that is good for hitting when heading out or coming back. Sometimes the hotel can be "too mod"--it takes a minute for your eyes to adjust when you walk in the lobby...at the hotel in Istanbul you had to walk in and out of a series of curtains. The last night in Istanbul all the mood lighting in the room malfunctioned and started coming on anf off. And this might just be me..but it usually takes me a minute to figure out the modern light switches and faucets. But the best part is the more you stay with them they will upgrade you and once you do a suite at the W it's very hard to go to other hotels!;4;3;2;2;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1588;6/19/2006;8i-p-VsGutZN97eB1B8-6w;vJq45v-ljNPJfR5B2doQKQ;Yeah, I'll admit it.  Sometimes I do go here with a couple girls and hang out in the lounge because it's THAT nice.  I wonder if it's possible to live here.  No, seriously.  If so, I'm staying in Chicago for the rest of my life.;5;3;1;1;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1589;5/29/2007;MfXo1fZOLptNZDFJYJ6zaA;qd-KsEaJfH-U0EP6D8Np_Q;I'm as surprised as anyone could be that I'm only giving the W Lake Shore 3 stars.  Last weekend was the third time I've stayed at this hotel and I'm sorry to say that it is getting to be about time for some renovations.   The downstairs lounge area is still as W as ever and I love the location, but the rooms were just "eh".  Our bamboo blinds were broken so the middle one didn't go up all the way and we had a lamp that was on when we came in the room, but that the switch was broken off of, so the only way we could figure to turn it off was to actually unplug the light bulb.  Not ideal.  Also I'm not that big of a fan of the rain shower head if it is only used in order to disguise low-ish water pressure, which I had the impression was the case at this W.  Under the rain shower head = warm goodness.  Everywhere else in the shower stall = BRRRR.  My legs were less than thrilled that I had to actually hold them under the water while shaving them because any other action would have been a direct trip to Goose Bump City.  Also the walls were really thin.  While getting ready for the wedding we went to Sunday night, we could hear every word coming out of the television next door.  As though it was in our room (and I don't even think that our neighbors had it turned up past normal volume). Anyway, W, if you are listening, maybe put some money into making the rooms more like new again.  The rooms are good-sized and the location and views are top-notch.  Easy fixes, I say. Until then, W Downtown might be a better bet.  Or if you are feeling silly spendy (or have the ole expense account working for you), stay at one of my all time faves, Park Hyatt Water Tower.  Sigh.  No Starwood points there though, my friend.;3;3;1;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1590;4/3/2007;vX7BNZ5hoeozopoqijVRUA;Um0oYx118CWVLSgISYaR5g;On a recent trip to Chicago, I stopped and asked a guy who looked surprisingly like Clark Kent what a fun place to go to was. He said the W and, naturally, we trust Superman. Off we were on our adventure. In the cab, my cohorts and I are throwing out some mojo to the cab driver. He laughs and is in love with us. He says, in a creepy tone, "You guys like to have fun?" We reluctantly answer, "yes." He pulls over and starts rummaging around. "Great," I think to myself, "we're gonna get offered coke." Imagine my surprise when he busts out a card with an address underneath a silhouette of a topless girl. "This is a great club," he says, "a very PRIVATE and EXOTIC club. You will have fun here." Uhh... We finally stumble upon the W. We mingle, we talk, we have fun. It's a great looking, very sleek bar. Like out of the Jetson's or something. Upstairs there's another small club. The drinks are weak and expensive (just like the rest of Chicago, what the fuck), but that's what you get at a hotel bar where you have absolutely no juice. Later on in the night, I meet some German dode and he explains, "jaah, the gurrlz weell bee coming in soon, jaah." I am a little exasperated, "Girls?" "Jaah, zee gurrls, you pay, kroners." Great, just great. The W: fun bar, just watch out for hookers!;3;2;1;2;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1591;7/23/2007;90JfxNVNkn3BYQTXf5C-xw;vS_0E5t7W6YA1JQBnBhudQ;Ugh. I will never stay at this hotel again. I am the one who picked the W in the first place, so I'll take the blame. It looks so plush and stylish in the photos. The first thing we noticed when walking in (besides Billy Zane getting into a limo... now I know it was an omen) was a club atmosphere in the lobby. There were lots of martini drinkers sitting around in sunglasses... The receptionists were too trendy for their own good, and I suspect that the one on the right was faking his English accent. (Oh yeah, they actually tell you to "take the lift" here...) In my opinion, it always is a mistake for a hotel staff to come off as condescending, and here, they definitely did. (There are plenty of high-end hotels who operate with friendliness.) We reserved a room with two queen beds, since my sister-in-law was joining us for a couple of days. We got off the elevator (which was scented, a nice touch) and, despite it being full daylight outside, were plunged into club-style darkness. The halls are very dark, with colored lights to guide your walk. When we opened our door, a lot of light was coming in from the big window. (We were on the west side of the hotel, so we had a crappy view of the building next door.) Ambient club music was playing from the small CD alarm clock, and the room looked really clean. Another look, and I realized there were Ws on everything... everything. My God, the room was one big marketing campaign and attempt to sell merchandise (including a $22 bottle of water that had been picked up and passed over so many times the logo had worn off). It was highly annoying to me. I started obsessing about finding everything that was W-branded -- and my finds included a teddy bear, the CD of music playing when we came in, coffee mugs, t-shirts -- and started seeing a lot of wear-and-tear on the room and furniture. Actually, it reminded me a lot of Design on a Dime... like it might look good to last through the photo/filming session, then all the cheap Scandinavian-style laminate furniture and other cost-cutting features start to fall apart and reveal the hotel for what it really is: the illusion of luxury and exclusivity. The most annoying thing, though, was the "divider" (yes, I said divider) between the bathroom and rest of the room. There was no solid, latching door, just a woven sliding panel that made comfortable privacy impossible. To boot, the panel in our room was BROKEN, so there was a hole in it. Also, there is a shuttered pass-through between the bathroom and bed area that doesn't fully close off any view or sound. I understand the concept (you can be in bed AND watch your lover take a shower... although the shower curtain was opaque, so I'm not sure what else you could watch), but when a room has two beds, there should be some consideration that lovers might not constitute a full party staying in a room. Not be be crass, but... there's this book called Everyone Poops. I think the W got confused and thought it was called Everyone Needs to Know When Everyone Poops. I give two stars for the beds being comfortable and room service (when requesting towels) being very prompt. Plus, we didn't get robbed... except for our dignity.;2;3;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1593;3/24/2007;N8HG27mN1MeE5WW8q9GExQ;xtZMctl7AQNspIL_SF3guA;My stay at the W Lakeshore was my first W experience, and overall it was really good. I liked the minimalist decor in the room, and thought the wood paneled wall was a nice touch. The bathroom was definitely nice, and the bath products were better than most hotel chains. The lobby bar seemed pretty cool, although I didn't get a chance to check it out. And the location was pretty good for where I needed to be in the River North area. The only area where the W Lakeshore fell short was the frat boy clientele that invaded the place on Friday night. In San Francisco we would call them the Bridge and Tunnel crowd, but in Chicago they were just a bunch of loud fuckin idiots who think a hotel is their personal playground at 4 in the morning. Kind of ruined the whole "urban sophisticate" vibe the W is trying to go for.;4;2;1;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1595;2/13/2007;nKTjpjunaZZqGuXcU8t0;Hv0D0BDrsarzvJSQXVschA;Like all W Hotels this place is very trendy and cutting-edge and somehow feels like a lounge/club masquerading as a hotel. In contrast to the downstairs concierge/bar/restaurant area the guest rooms and hallways are all very dimly lit and decorated in shades of black, grey and dark pink. Everything is modern, hip and edgy, including the staff. Although after working in a W Hotel on the west coast myself I can definitely say that the employees here were  not as friendly or helpful as those in the other Ws I've been in. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my stay here and the location simply cannot be beat -- very central and the only hotel in Chicago that is actually right on Lake Shore Drive. Don't plan on a weekend stay unless you are prepared for the social scene which can include loud late nights full of drunk people wandering around the lobby who are just as likely not to be hotel guests.;4;1;3;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1600;7/20/2009;ic5JW2onWWHmT3gDIfzNRw;DDnq7zxsWNbrHwB8Yc2FoQ;I recently stayed at the W Lakeshore for a few days and as time progressed I was less and less impressed with the joint. The rooms (and hotel) is pretty modern, but you can tell it was a holiday inn that got converted. Although my room wasn't bad, a friend of mine got stuck with a really crappy room where the wallpaper was peeling off, the shades were broken, and the shower wasn't the rain shower advertised. I had a "city view" room and wasn't impressed with the view. Basically it was looking directly into another hotel or office building, and looking down into an alley. Lake view rooms are the way to go. The W however does shine in the attention to detail department. If you are able to focus listening to the techno music in the elevator you would see the floor mats are updated throughout the day to say "Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening", which is something I haven't seen at any other hotel. I attended a wedding on here and the ballroom was converted to a very intimate setting, which was unexpected. The reception was held on the 33rd floor in a nice hall overlooking the lake and city. This was the best part of my stay here. The Whiskey Sky bar on the 33rd floor is dark and small, and drinks are expensive. After one drink in here I had to take off as I couldn't stand being unable to see my hand in front of my face and couldn't move without bumping into someone. Picture being in a walk in closet with the lights off and you'll get the same feel as this place. As others have reported, the lobby doubles as a lounge for the first floor bar at night, so if possible try to avoid this area at night. You won't be able to hear anyone working the counter, and they won't be able to hear you. If you aren't  in 'clubbing' attire you probably will catch a few unwelcoming glances by the older crowd drinking at the bar. Another disappointing  aspect of this joint is the pool on the 7th floor. It leaves much to be desired. Also, don't go into this place looking for a hot tub, because there isn't one to be found. Very surprising for such an expensive place. The gym however looked pretty nice, with free weights, machines, a cardio deck and kettle balls. All in all, if you want to get more bang for your buck, stay somewhere else in the city. If you do find yourself staying here, get a lake view room and hope for good weather so you aren't trapped in a real life version of A Night at the Roxbury.;2;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1602;12/5/2010;VovT;qcyELeKglb06BRbdXVCcXA;Was here last night for some drinks. This was a terrible experience. It was cold and drafty because you're basically in a hotel lobby. The drinks are overpriced. The decor was scary! The clientele was interesting to watch but was full of tourist, douche bags and odd balls.

1603;11/24/2010;5XZe-l0sp;lrZ9OdTMguSardX1mH9QbA;Pains me to write this, but just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it did.  We stayed here for three nights.  I wrote my last review upon arrival:unfortunately, the stay did not improve.  I doubt that I will stay at this W again, and sadly, my GF says she will never stay at another W - not even the new W Maldives :(   Rather than go into details, I will simply write a laundry list of issues: 1) I already mentioned: rough sheets and a hard bed. As for decor, I'll give them a break, since they are renovating in the next year or two. 2) Overwhelming lemon scent coming from the bed and could not sleep.    We asked housekeeping to change all linens in hopes of "fixing" the issue. They did:however, the issue was not resolved.  Come to discover (we discovered, not housekeepping) that somebody poured a substance on the bed and it was simply "covered up" and not addressed by housekeeping. Kudos to Grant for moving us to another room, actually a suite. I have an issue with this, too.  I am Platinum with Starwood and they are supposed to automatically upgrade me to the "best room/suite" available - but, we did not get a suite until there was an issue.  hmmm... 3) Toilet did not flush properly Issues with room # 2 4) The TV did not work until after we unplugged and reconfigured the wiring. 5) Wireless internet did not work in the suite.  Would go in and out. 6) The light in the living room flickered. 7) The vanity mirror/light shocked my GF when she touched it.  Fortunately, she was wearing shoes with rubber soles. 8) The heater/AC couldn't decide if it wanted to be hot or cold 9) The window covering in the bedroom did not roll up;1;2;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1604;10/6/2005;2RulfX3oSaOaDM-7aqzYlw;I11zT6U1lAI2qd8b5O2pvw;I've been in one of the rooms here before. It honestly was pretty cool looking--wood paneled walls with a really big modern bathroom with some weird  little window that opened up onto the room. But I'm still not convinced it was $300 a night good. For that much money there should be, like a bottle of champain waiting for you. And a whore in the bed.;3;0;0;4;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1605;8/4/2005;BVGdAiymZvIXcBv9ep6jZg;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;This old Holiday Inn and Days Inn has found new life, as the W makes its mark on Lake Shore Drive. It is definitely hipper than its old incarnations, and the Wave is a popular hangout for food and drink. It is very convenient to Navy Pier, but slightly removed from the action of the Magnificent Mile.;4;1;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1607;3/22/2008;Y5EuVdTRMgkXrxhMEC3kvg;u7BGVnHaWgOlsfUy1pjolw;For the amount, I wasn't too impressed. While I do enjoy the decor, it's a little too trendy for me. The loud, thumping music and the candlelight at night -- gimme a break. Plus, they gave me a smoking room when I requested a non-smoking room. Then I asked for a non-smoking room again and they didn't switch me even though they had other rooms. Annoying!

The lounge bar usually has some stiff drinks but we had sangria that was more ice than fruit.

1615;3/30/2008;3wBx4Ww;9DPtOR39gFcs7A_lysyZzg;I like that this W has a living room, cozy feel looking out over the lake.  The rooms are pretty cool, especially when you have the SPG points and get a  lake-side view.  I also really enjoyed room service.  As far as W Hotels go, this is one of my favorite ... but both of the Chicago ones are cozy.;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1617;3/27/2010;AfVddosd8gUi4QFdiog4ng;LGVxU2m0jebINWInGfwGDg;I've now stayed here dozens of times and it seems to be a staple property for my team when we work in Chicago. Overall it's a great property, but the location is a bit inconvenient.  Aside from the proximite to Navy Pier, it's a bit out of the way from the downtown area, or the uptown nightlife. The bar area is very cool with tons of space for people to spread out on a variety of different chairs/couches. On each of the floors, there is a little telescope that allows you to view Navy Pier from an elevated view, which is a nice cool touch. The valet guys are very helpful- they'll waive down cabs that are lined up around the corner of Lakeshore drive.  However, the design of the drop-off/pick-up circle is very odd.  Sometimes you have traffic going in both directions, and in the busy mornings, it's not uncommon to get stuck between a few cars going in different directions. Note: I am on a personal mission to stay at every W Hotel in the USA (and then hopefully branch out to worldwide!);4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
1618;8/18/2010;O8SmnuIV3W7qks8mjbua4Q;0qQI-n_ZfrwBewAgr1Nt8g;this W hotel is located near navy pier. it is an older building that used to be another hotel. okay, so i'm going to go through the bad before the good. several things were quite strange to me.   1) there is no shower door.  so i'm kinda cold while taking a shower     since the heat doesn't stay within the shower. 2) there are no curtains.  the windows have a shade on them but     sunlight still gets in...and i believe people could see us if they were     in a building across from us with binoculars.  not that great for     watching tv in the afternoon since there is a glare. 3) you can tell they don't dust.  yes, the beds are made and the     bathrooms are freshened...but you can tell that the glasses and     other things have a lot of dust on them. 4) there was a spider crawling in my bed.  maybe the itchy bite above     my hip is a spider bite.  don't know...but it's annoying.. 5) when we needed suggestions, we tried to ask the front desk.  they     kept referring us to the concierge.  well, the concierge didn't know     about any of the places we were talking about.  i suggest that the W     hire someone for the concierge who gives out tips and recs on     where to go instead of giving me a blank look when i'm talking     about some of the hot spots of downtown.  DON'T HIRE A     COLLEGE KID who doesn't know enough to be a concierge.  just     giving them a computer so that they could search the place doesn't     cut it.  i do that myself already... 6) free wifi in the lobby BUT NOT IN THE ROOMS. 7) AND FOR THE BIGGEST GRIPE...     THE ELEVATORS!!!       how can you have 4 elevators for 33 floors?  (oh, and one time, 2 of     them were not working..) when there was a wedding reception on     the 33rd floor, it would have been nice to have a designated     elevator going there instead of having guests wait forever to go     up/down.  fridays and saturdays...you have to wait a while cuz     people are hanging out at the bar on the 33rd floor...and if there is     also a special event...good luck. the good... 1) customer service is good and responsive. 2) they have some partnership with acura.  they have a free chauffeur     service from 12-7:30pm that will take you within 5 miles of the W     hotel.  easy booking. 3) great location!!  walking distance to navy pier...and also my fav     brunch place: yolk!  =) 4) we used points for the 1st 2 nights and got the 4th night free, so     really only paid for ONE full night.  sweet!! 5) pretty lobby with trendy furniture.  nice bar area with plenty of seating 6) staff is nice and professional.  i think the head guy (manager or     something) came up to us while we were sitting at the lobby just to     ask how we were doing...if we needed anything.  he gave good     suggestions on where to go, what to do. if you are not a hotel guest and just want to hang out, this is the place for you.  plenty of seating, nice bar, free wifi.  patio seating outside overlooking the water is cool.  then head up to the 33rd floor lounge to chill.;3;4;2;3;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

1623;8/19/2010;yfy;yiRZCGwzebRM5mnLpYfFqA;i love spg. i love W. i love THIS W hotel!!! at first i was a bit disappointed that i was not staying at the W hotel downtown and had to settle for the W hotel lakeshore. i've stayed at the one downtown near the sears tower but i think i would actually chose this location instead. if you're into walking, you can walk from one to the other but it is a bit far. the lakeshore location is near the navy pier which you can see from your hotel room. it is also close to the magnificent mile for shopping! for the rooms there are two options: lake view room and city view rooms (self explanatory). the set up for the two is the same essentially, just your view is different. im not in the hotel room long enough to really care. the rooms are spacious. i got a double bed room and the two of us had plenty of room. i love the bliss brand shampoo, conditioner, face wash, bar soap, and lotion they give you! the design of the room almost seemed like you were living in a cabana. there were two door wooden shutters from the bathroom that you can look out into the room. wierd at first b/c you can look into the bathroom but then convenient when you had people in your room and you can socialize while getting ready in the bathroom. this W like all W's are beautiful and modern. it's like you're entering a club 24/7. i stayed over the weekend (fri-sun) and the lobby was busy both nights. when you check-in, they offer you a free drink ticket at that bar!! there were 4 of us in our mid-20s and we wanted to go out and had NO idea were to go.. so one of us asked the concierge where to go and he gave us some suggestion and his card. at first we were hesitant to go b/c we werent sure if they were just selling the place b/c they were getting a commission or if this place was actually good. we first went to a jazz bar which was cool b/c they were playing live music. we didnt stay too long but it was a good experience b/c chicago has such a lively music scene. we then took a taxi to Y club and got in line. the bouncer said the club was closed only to people on the guestline or cover was $20/person. then my friend said that our concierge from the W gave us his card and said we could get in for free. and the bouncer was like ''oooh you're with the W.. go on in" same thing happened at crescendo! both pretty high scale lounge/clubs. we saved $40/person just by talking to our concierge. if you dont' call that service, i dont konw what is!! also while i was waiting in the lobby for a taxi, a couple walks in with 3 dogs, one about 70lbs the other two about 10lbs. and i spoke to them a bit and they said the westin has a really good dog policy. theres no extra charge, just a deposit in case of any damage. don't know how true that is but if you want to bring your dog along with you, W's are the place to go! anyway, highly recommended. there was a good mix of younger people, as well as families. a little bit of everything for anyone.;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

One other thing, there wasn't as much "hard rock" stuff as I would have anticipated.  We had a picture of Marilyn Manson in our room which was a little creepy but not bad haha.  But If there were more little music/rock things around the room it would have felt 'cooler.'  But all in all it was a fantastic stay.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would love to stay here again.;4;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1631;8/8/2012;qGrrS5qANvUWbSxnGlzGnw;YUoFGXZmPL41zeXTGFZWJA;I can't say I was thrilled with this hotel.  Everything was just 'meh' and at one point - gross.  The room was ok and the bed was nice, yadda yadda. Loved the horizontal mirror above the headboard. Bathroom was clean, city view was 'meh'. I was getting ready for bed and looked towards the wall near the ceiling, and next to the smoke alarm was a small towel stuck into what looked like a hole in the wall at the top. To gross and weird me out even more, there was brown stuff on the towel like the towel was plugging who knows what! ugh! I started to call the front desk about it, but it was so late (almost 1AM) I was tired and after a series of flights, I was done. I hadnt eaten either, so I decided to order room service. While browsing the menu options, the crab, spinach and artichoke dip sounded nice. Again, it was late, I didn't want anything too heavy - I had a big day ahead of me and needed to get some sleep. I placed the order and it was brought up in about 15 minutes.  While I waited, I was admiring my view of the city. What I didnt know was that there were others admiring the view too. Yes, there were gnats near the window! gross!! Needless to say, I was not the only one enjoying the spinach and artichoke dip. Oh and the dip was cold. I put the crap right outside my door. What a waste. The next morning I noticed a couple spiders crawling on the window pane - INSIDE the room! I feel like if there were others in the room, I should've been notified. Didnt know my stay would include gnats and spiders. Disgusting. I will NOT be staying here again.;2;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1634;4/10/2012;ayFIdSkf4HRV6MXeI8E-gw;WuFA4HkgOpY0QADy3xwKvA;My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock for 4 nights last summer. I got us a great deal that I was very happy with. Complimentary WiFi was included with our stay. We stayed on floor with the AC/DC memorabilia. The room and the bathroom were spacious and very well kept. The housekeeping service was impeccable. In fact all the staff was very courteous and professional. The location can't be beat - the hotel is right in the middle of everything. It's very close to Millennium Park and the Wendella Boat Rides are right next to it. The shops at North Bridge are only 5 blocks away. You can easily walk to Navy Pier as well. It shouldn't take you more than 15-20 minutes. John Hancock Center is quite close too - about a mile away. There are a lot of places where you can eat around. Cabs and public transportation are both easily accessible if you decide to visit Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science & History. I would recommend staying at this hotel.;5;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1635;3/1/2012;6J6JnbZVC2Q564J0CY03rg;tpAECyiw4w6o8wNqeXd_kg;Gets four stars for its location and price.  I booked this guy on Jetsetter and found a decent deal $150 a night booking two days in advance.  I was happy with that given that its in the heart of downtown and a very clean hotel.  Has a very trendy modern feel.  The lobby is real small, but has a free pool table.  My room was very clean and well kept.   Read my review on the bard downstairs - iddn't love that place at all.  But honestly, this was really just  a place to crash while I conquered Chicago for the weekend. I'll try and stay somewhere else next time ONLY bc I like to try new hotels to keep the experience fresh, but I would recommend this hotel to anybody.;4;2;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1636;6/21/2012;BRHfizet8bLfQtfrgMITag;zJg4SBiWablLgygYKeJ8eg;This is a nice option when in Chicago.  Location is great.  Definitely has the vibe and decor that you would expect for the Hard Rock brand.  Room review: * Bed is nice and comfortable.  Not too hard, not too soft. * Bathroom nicely appointed / strong water pressure in the shower / nice bath products. * Due to the materials they used, some of the furniture is a bit beat up / will be hard to fix (would need to be replaced). Good electronics - big flat screen TV, clock with iPod dock. I was here for a corporate function, so I didn't pay the bill.  Good option if you can get in here for $200-300/night.;3;0;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1637;2/20/2012;tFBPVbJ-pzT5K5V4DiJ64Q;FW4h4VoMmERdncf9VK2jhA;While it wasn't quite what I expected, my family and I had a great time at the Hard Rock Hotel, and it was perfect for celebrating my son's 16th birthday. It was a guitar-loving teenager's dream to be able to check out a guitar and take to our room! I did expect the "rock star"  theme to be more extreme than it was, as it was a bit subdued, yet tasteful. The entrance was small, dark and had loud music blaring, which was a bit odd, but yet made us feel like we were in for a good time.  It was fun to go floor to floor to see which rock star was featured there and to see some memorabilia.   The room was stylishly decorated. However, it was quite dark in the hallway, and especially the bathroom which made it very difficult for my husband to shave and me to get ready in the morning. There is a very dimly-lit makeup mirror that did little to no good. The beds and pillows were very comfy. My main complaint in the room was the windows - they did very little to drown out the street noise and we were 22 stories high! Drawing the curtains did offer some help, but the blaring sirens that we heard throughout the night sounded like they were right in the room with us. Staff was friendly, concierge was extremely helpful, valet was professional. We had to wait well beyond check-in time for our room to be ready which was a pain, but they gave my husband some free drink tickets to use while we waited. Too bad the free drinks didn't help us as it was a family trip and we aren't big drinkers. Overall it was a good experience, made especially good by spending time with my awesome family.;3;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1638;1/7/2012;S6V2XvlqOwQtfHEQDqFAlw;6IYHNjQbmjAlWi3U14EgzA;Very cool hotel, good location in the Loop! We bagged a Tower Suite at a great price, and man was it amazing! It was like 800 Sq. Ft and was very cool. The view was amazing! Kinda small in the lobby & stuff, but the service was pretty good. We did not have time to try the lounges or restaurants, so that will have to wait till next time. I would def stay here again, especially in the Tower Suite. It was pretty "rock star"!;4;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1639;12/14/2011;86xsUgZLlQoS0ivRsZANNQ;Mna6U7kUX36l8-dpDt-U-A;While I really wanted to love this place--Meh-not that impressive. I did not find the staff to be welcoming at all.  The staff did not hold the door for us despite standing next to it outside.  They also did not hail a cab for us when we were leaving.  The check-in process was cold and not very welcoming.  Front desk was not even close to assisting you to find your next attraction.  Concierge was MIA.   The room was spacious, but cold temperature-wise. We happend to go on a very cold weekend, and our bathroom was constantly ice cold.  The tile floor was like standing on ice, and it didn't matter if you turned the bathroom heat on either.  It just never got warm.  We were on the 10th floor and had a considerable amount of street noise in our room. The bar was a total rip off, and they played lousy music.  It has so much potential too...  Overpriced drinks and terrible DJ will drive anyone away.  I don't know why they bother to stay open to 3 am... ZERO novelty there. I don't think I will ever stay there again. It was considerably far enough away from everything, that any *savings* on your room rate will be quickly eaten up in cab fares.  And while they attempt to be a cool hip hotel, the reality is anyone off the street can walk in and take an elevator to any floor.  There's no one standing between the MI Ave entrance and the elevators to the room.  No key-control on the elevator.  Even my JOB has that after you walk past security for crying outloud!;3;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1640;8/28/2011;ecq1CCW;gCQmTheUcBwaDVTp6U5pTA;First lets talk= money King size room with a nice lounge area in the heart of downtown for under $140 thanks to Groupon. $46 over night parking.....yeesh,pricey I know.....but after fighting through rush hour traffic and oodles of construction the price could have been 5x that and I still would have thrown the valet my keys 9$ for mixed drinks at the bar....tourist trap! Second= Service Bell Hop, Front Desk, and Valet were all professional....not amazing but I wasn't expecting the Hotel from Pretty Woman Third= atmosphere/experience I was hoping the Hard Rock was going to be super cheesy.....zebra skins and chandeliers.  But it was pretty tame...looked like most of the places I've stayed in Vegas with an occasional guitar just hanging out in a hallway.   In the end, its just a hotel.  A place to lay your head betwix the journey.  Bottom Line: It was clean and the right price.....service did what service was supposed to do.;4;4;0;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1641;12/29/2011;m5dZplrWhpuQqzqIlta1Bg;C3rISrRWv7KWfNhLj4_j9A;Tonight is our first time here, and we are loving every bit of it! Our room is clean, stylish and comfortable to hang out in. We really appreciate the attention to details that the Hard Rock displays, we immediately understood the brand as soon as we stepped in. Confetti exploded in our brains when we heard we could rent a guitar for free - we had no choice but to try it out! We even loved the guy who brought it up to our room, he was full of energy and personality. -- In fact, everyone we've encountered here has been that same way:which makes me think that either the company management treats them very well or that cool people just happen to work here (I hope both). I don't think one night here will be enough time to experience all that this hotel has to offer. We will definitely be back.;5;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1642;8/14/2011;bS-kHj0kymbk;a8lVx7eUfdU9z55ypcCwbQ;A great idea for a hotel! As someone who would rather crash at a friends place when visiting an old city of residence than stay at a hotel in a tourist destination, it was a nice change for once. My friend and I had a Groupon for a good rate, and we had a nice room! It was on a lower level than advertised, but it was still a good view. Right in the heart of some nice places to drink. Each level has a theme for each band and a piece of memorabilia relating to that band. We had the Rolling Stones. I got to stare at David Bowie taking a wee, and sometimes if you're in the right place at the right time, you can run into minor celebrities! Unfortunately, the Check In, Rock Out program requires a $1,000 guarantee in case of any damages. What would have been a potential incentive turned out to be something we couldn't do due to the extraordinary price for a guitar that costs less than that, even for a nice model! However, this was only minor as the experience was very well-received. We also were given a code for free wi-fi that didn't work. We didn't say anything since we didn't need it for anything important. And thinking being a Groupon user would make them incorporate some crazy fees, we only had to pay extra for taxes. Not bad for a one night stay!;3;1;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1643;7/2/2011;P2HlBe9v7aivXkatuOqrbA;9k-MhpF0ywckWtxJVI7DCg;Our second stay at the Hard Rock. We enjoy the historic building and perfect location on Michigan Ave at the River. Close to the action. The hotel design is understated and not Theme Park-Like (as their restaurants). Rooms, clean, contemporary and well appointed. Kind of strange to have Yoko Ono and John Lennon staring at you from over the loo. Staff is polite, effiecient. I enjoyed a drink at the bar before going out. Again, the environment is nice. Check out each floor. The have one Rocker's  memorabilia displayed simply at each elevator lobby. Both times we enjoyed our views from the room. Tips: A perfect spot to The first time we stayed, we were able to find a "package deal" this time we were able to get a discount online, check Yelp, Hotwire or http://Hotels.com. AAA or AARP (if your over 50). The web site states you get free wi-fi if you book direct on the Hard Rock Hotel web site (normally $14/day). We did not book directly online because we were ale to get a better deal by searching. Try to get on a higher floor For the views - the city noises are audible (well at least the emergency vehicle sirens are). After settling in, we decided to park our car at the Millennium or Grant Street Garages for $29/day VS Hard Rock's $46/day. Pay attention to your phone messages, you may get an announcement of live music at the bar.;4;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1644;2/19/2011;ZNvK4lstq6dNHCIePjl3WA;4S-9mdOHcj_dqCTgBV5u4g;There is nothing really special about this hotel.  It has a rock & roll theme so basically means that there's a picture of John Lennon in your room instead of.. umm... dogs playing poker?  The room, bed and bathroom are fine but the details are where this place misses.  For example: -no free wifi in the room -the service is friendly but not good, i.e. really slow -the tv is fine but the remote is so crude and cheap that it's just not worth it -lighting in the rooms and lobby that is truly terrible -the hotel bar looks like it belongs on MTV but feels out of place in Chicago Do yourself a favor and book at the Renaissance across the street--same price point, same location, and free wifi.;2;2;1;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1645;12/15/2010;rRJ-jjdhAKiP-UnsCGwmKw;Y7ihQ8cVQTxO4LTYVuyd2Q;I...wanna rock n roll all niiiight...and party every day!!  Come here if you want to pretend you're a rock and roll star!  Don't worry, the dark hues and gold trim will hide any evidence of partying too hard into the wee hours.  In fact, if hookers in the lobby at 1am is any indication, this kind of behavior is encouraged!  Seriously.  I saw two of them. Overall, great hotel.  It's like the Sheraton's cooler, funkier, more colorful cousin.  All the hospitality and amenities are there, just rock and roll!  I think my favorite part had to be the bathroom.  No sliding shower door or curtains.  Just a slab of glass covering the shower part with a side entry.  Totally something this mod girl would love having in her house.  Beds are pretty comfy.  What they lack in comfort is made up for in size.  I could spread out without worrying about kicking the bf off the bed (which I am prone to doing on a standard queen)! Request a high floor because the views are stellar.  I could see the Bean from our window!  Oh, and that spiders note by the windows during warm weather is totally true (those of you who have been know what I'm talking about), so keep the windows closed! If there is one reason to stay here, it's the location.  You can't beat it.  Plus it's way affordable if you "rock" Hotwire or http://Hotels.com.  I hope I see someone famous next time!;4;4;3;3;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

The location is great, the prices are reasonable I guess, and the people working here are friendly. The beds were comfortable, but the sheets were stiff. And just a tip - don't eat breakfast here through room service. It's not very good, but it is very expensive. A bonus is that they do have free wireless Internet if you are traveling on business. You simply have to agree to the terms ever 24 hours. I believe they also have free wi-fi in the lobby if you're looking for a place to work in the area.;3;4;1;2;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1649;8/2/2009;4BTJ9S3ldOuE8IzqNfjing;oGiqow-Dt9IMepgkswdM4A;Stayed overnight here last week and out of the two hotels I stayed at in my trip, this was def. the better of the two. I was able to check in at 1pm (even tho check is at 3pm) - very cool since I had been traveling since 5am and was pretty damn tired. Front lobby was nothing spectacular - a couple of couches and concierge but they do have some cool music playing there. There are also 2 computers in the lobby area that you can use for free! The room itself is very sleek and modern. Lots of mirrors in this room! The bed was really comfortable - pillow-top mattress and down pillows! Aveda products to use in the bathroom - very nice! There is a sensored mini-bar - so while you can look, the moment you move the item, you will get charged. Whats great is that there is a 24 hr fitness and business center free of use age! Which is great because I love to check my email everyday. Overall, very convenient location - 2 blocks away from Millennium park, Chicago River, near a lot of their subway lines, and many shops and stores. The comforter was a little thin though - but then maybe its because I'm always cold, and thought that even in July, Chicago was cold! Wish there was a complimentary continental breakfast like the Amalfi hotel had that I stayed in earlier in the month, but that's okay. Def. would love to stay here again when I come back to Chicago!;4;1;1;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1650;5/9/2010;HqCt;pK1lDJPqCQth68ov6K4ieA;We reserved a block of rooms at the Hard Rock for our April wedding. While we were passed around to a few different salespeople over the 8 months or so that we spent planning, everyone was very helpful and friendly. We locked down a rate of $149 per night for king rooms, which is a pretty amazing price for that location.  As the husband (like most of our friends) is an architect, we appreciated the fact that the hotel is housed in the historic (and gorgeous) Carbon and Carbide Building. We really wanted our out of town guests to experience the awesomeness of Chicago, and the hotel's location made that extremely easy. We were given a tower suite at the same rate, and the room was HUGE, which made getting ready on the big day very easy. It's true that some of the finishes aren't exactly the highest quality, but you know, it's not the Ritz. The staff was very courteous and helpful, though we did have a couple of glitches. The first had to do with the gift bags we had made for our guests. Originally I had been told that we could have them handed out at check in, and as long as they were all the same and not personalized (i.e., specific bags to specific people) they would do it for free. A week before the wedding I found out that they had changed their policy and now would only distribute bags to the rooms at a $5 per bag fee. They finally agreed to hand them out for free as they had originally promised, though I would imagine we were an exception.   The other snag had to do with the bar- I had spoken (via email) with the bar manager about bringing our guests there after the wedding, which was to end at midnight on Sunday. We weren't going to pre order anything or reserve space, just offer a place for people to hang out, which the bar manager said was fine.  When we got back to the hotel it was close to 1, and the bar was closed (it's supposed to be open till 2).  But everything was solved by a brief talk with the front desk manager who allowed us to hang out in the lobby with the beers we brought back from the wedding (classy, no?). When we FINALLY made it to our room for the night, we were greeted by champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries, and fancy bottled water. Nice touch.;4;1;1;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1651;6/11/2007;Vg5bTdFrK8Pwr7gbaN6ANg;nShq32BVmWcDvLVz6EDbkw;The decor in the hotel is great--dark, modern, and sophisticated. The lobby and rooms are well-appointed, with super comfy beds topped with down blankets (a must as far as I'm concerned) and feather pillows. The rooms are reasonable, though amenities in the minibar are overpriced--common in hotels. The service is generally good. I had a few issues with the bar staff, but other than that, I enjoyed my stay. Frankly, though the W City Center feels more rock and roll than the Hard Rock.;4;1;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1652;5/12/2007;MNC9NnKE8eLNJ6PiTHQB6w;M1YMMS7FcggrMog8fL9h7Q;I stayed with my husband at the HRH last week (May 2007)  because the Hilton SCREWED up our reservations, only had smoking rooms, to which I said NO WAY, FIND ME A HOTEL, and everything was booked and finally the only thing left was a junior suite at the HRH.   And frankly, the suites are TRES COOL.  Much better I bet than the Hilton Suites (between Chicago and Dearborn I think!) So anyway, HRH is RIGHT on the bridge, very good location.  The decor outside is kinda crappy, but as soon as you go in, I feel like Kurt Cobain is gonna come greet us, Sheryl Crow will be singing a tune at the bar, and Bob Dylan will take our reservations.  Front desk was TOO attentive, offering us everything from late night munchies to things to do at 12:00 am in Chicago (that's when we finally go the room, thanks to the Hilton....).  When we got to the room, it was TRES swanky (there were two suites to a floor, so imagine the size!!!).  Amenities were normal to a regular room, although we WERE told about the fiasco regarding the mini bar, so we just opted for not even opening it.  Beds were fantastic, bathroom was VERY big for a big city hotel, and all in all, I'd totally return. Very hip.  Much fun if you're into music.  Very young. Very me.;5;1;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1653;7/8/2007;yAerUZJKW7bNcYVH-Z3YXQ;WJnEifJRkI6bCH2iw8brFg;Very nice, comfortable and SPACIOUS rooms... no room for improvement in that area. Service was fine, although the concierge was slightly pretentious. Eww. Hard Rock is at a great location on the Magnificent Mile so its very easy to get around to Millennium Park and all the shops. I wasn't terribly crazy about their bar, however, and found it on the smaller side... also it was filled with fanny pack wearing tourists (i.e., Hard Rock seems to be mostly families who were staying there which I am totally fine with but at 8AM when you hear kids screaming at each other and Mom & Dad yelling at them to shut up next door to your room it's not good...) Overall I was impressed with Hard Rock and would recommend to others who are fine with that...but I'll probably try the James Hotel or the Sofitel Hotel next time.;4;1;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1655;4/8/2008;YghPBQwMmVsydopH2a-4QA;qjD5ZCNV81t0pUvh96Mh3A;Note this is a review for the lounge. Friday night after work me and a couple friends met up here for some drinks. I expected this to be shotty service and a played out theme. This gem has been calling my name since I moved here but I never answered. I bucked up big Friday and made my move. Now, I'm more of a "rob roy" or  "gin and tonic" guy. However, I had the pineapple/cilantro martini. Let me just say...what a treat that was. I eneded up with 3 of those and before I know it, i was flying high. The chicken tender appetizer they offer is pretty tasty. I'll go back here for drinks after work again, and maybe for a night cap but this place seems like somewhere to start and end your night rather than spend the whole time here.;4;1;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

For the location, I found very few other options in the same price range. I arrived at the hotel several hours before check in time, but the concierge happily stored my bags went out for a few hours. I utilized the service again after check out. Overall the service from both the front desk and the concierge station were dripping with eagerness, but the competency level was a bit lacking. The lines at the front desk were frustratingly slow whether one employee or three were behind the counter. The room is what made the hotel for me. It was huge, and by my standards, could have been two save for the single bathroom. I took showers while relishing a view of Millennium Park. I chased indulgent nights away with coffee from the Keurig maker. I fell asleep in the comfy bed while watching the oversized TV. Some small complaints I had included the previously mentioned, slow as molasses front desk. Also, the bed was stacked with all down pillows. I hate that so much. Seriously, a girl needs a little support sometimes. And well,  I might be reaching here, but this one puzzled me: The room was stocked with more varieties of decaf coffee than caffeinated. It was a good thing my roommate didn't drink coffee, or there might have been an epic morning battle over the second cup. All in all, a good place to rest my weary mind and wobbly body after long days spent eating, drinking, exploring, and indulging my inner tourist.;3;0;1;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

I must have been sick last visit because there are things this time that I cannot believe i missed last time. When you check in the music in the lobby is so loud that you cannot have a conversation with the person who checks you in. You also cannot hang out in the lobby and have a conversation live, on the phone or any other way. I am not that old that this should be an overlooked factor. My room. So dark that even with all the lights on I felt like a blind 90 year old. Then there is the fridge - you can't use it all. I had to call down to check it out/ They happily supplied me another fridge sent up by two little frail woman. I felt so bad for them that I took it off the cart and placed it on the floor in fear that one of these two women would hurt themselves. Tip: Send up a guy next time, not two little Spanish women that the fridge is bigger than. If you need to send a woman - have her there to hold the door. Then there was this noise. A clicking noise all night long outside of my room. I called to complain and the first time they said "we will check it out." No response. The next morning when I told the chick at the desk about the issue and she asked me "are you sure that the noise is not your alarm clock?" Really? My response: "I am not that retarded but thanks for checking." Problem never solved. Then the last straw: No freekin Coffee. My lifeblood. Working on no sleep because of clicking. Can't get work done because of lighting. Can't work in the lobby because of noise then, two days in a row, no coffee in the lobby. Day 1: "we are working on it." - waited for 10 minutes before swearing and leaving for my meeting. Day 2: No coffee. I proceed to stand at front desk with my empty cup starting the conversation with "day 2 no coffee" and waited there front and center until desk guy goes in the back and gets me a cup. No refill and others look at my coffee with lust and hatred. RUN far and fast from this place. Effort and atmosphere lacking. Seriously.;1;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1659;9/9/2010;NEJKNQlwYu0w4Sz10aj4RQ;jp4X9H56zjjLacnpHz02Iw;Stayed at the HR over Labor day weekend '10.. and had two different room types. The first night we stayed in a Deluxe King room and it was cozy but nice. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room as we didn't land until 8pm and it took an hour to get to the hotel and then we went to grab a late bite. The balance of the stay (3 nights) we stayed the Platinum King which was a corner room with two views of the city. Things I loved: The front desk was really helpful and remembered us. We didn't have to deal with any messy issues and they called us when our room was ready (we had to change our rooms since they were different levels). They stored our bags (for free - in Vegas:they sometimes charge $1/bag). The concierge called us twice to inform us that our room was ready:I thought that was nice in case we were killing time (which we weren't). The hotel sent us a place of fresh strawberries, chocolate fondue and champagne as we were there for a celebration. I thought that was such a nice touch as other hotels we've stayed at on special occasions did not acknowledge at all (despite being listed on reservation). The bathrooms were nice with upgraded amenities. The smell of sweetgrass still gives me a smile as all the products smelled like it. There were lots of mirrors and comfortable beds. I enjoyed the non-down pillow in the closet (with an additional blanket) as I'm allergic to down pillows. Close location to downtown area with lots nearby to eat and hang out. Train stop is only a block away and can utilize to get around city without large cab fees. Your room key gives you a 15% discount to the Hard Rock Cafe although it is about a mile or so (walking). We walked there but there were no directions to it and we thankfully just used our itouch to get there. Cons: Elevators were a bit confusing as only one bay seemed to be functioning despite having 6. Fridge was weighted and so you were unable to use for personal items. I usually prefer to buy my own water as I like to stay hydrated so we had to just drink room temp so we didn't get charged for moving things around in the fridge. There was only one robe in the room and it wasn't as soft as some hotels we've stayed in. Overall, I was impressed with the Hard Rock. We've stayed at many hotels which were pricier and didn't make us feel special or valued. HR definitely made us feel it was worth the value as well as accomodating. We asked for late check-out and they granted us an additional hour. Check-out was painless and we were able to just walk out and leave keys in the room. Would definitely stay there again the next time we visit.;5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1660;10/4/2009;EHio;htWfqjFTrCCddpJ_QGQtQQ;I have to say, I had little if any expectations when I was booking our rooms here.  Boy, was I surprised.  All 18 of us had only positive feedback - not one negative or even sub-par comment (and that says a lot with this diva minded crowd). GREAT, great, great staff.  The building itself is gorgeous and easy to spot from the exterior.  They're planning a renovation soon (very much unnecessary in my opinion- no sign of the typical wear-and-tear).  There is a Starbucks located in the same building- bonus - and they are centrally located to everything. I'll be staying here the next time I'm in Chicago - no question about that one.;5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1661;4/11/2010;8ZJm645AP-pWx;-_gihqWuppoSHSR-qSbg5g;If you are coming to Chicago its Hard to beat this location- its near everything- Art Institute, Navy Pier, state Street, Michigan Avenue...etc. The rooms are small but sexy as is the menu and the stuff in the minibar. The Carbide and Carbon Building is an architectural gem and its worth checking out even if you don't stay here. We had a great view from our room- straight down Michigan Avenue.  It did not find that, however, distracting. :);4;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1663;6/16/2011;V-V2UOMRnYFoo0k1P7WFjw;UuIr2WKA0gZRyRvWIlAduQ;I was really disappointed by this hotel. When you think "Hard Rock" you think of something really impressive and historical. The lobby/bar are nice and they make some good drinks, but beyond that there is nothing to brag about. The rooms are plain, some views from the rooms suck, and they don't have a lot of rock memorbilia. We have been here a few times and i have made the decision I won't go back. It's not worth the money.;2;1;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1665;7/7/2007;iL8O9SKkjDtmxdvCDRvk8w;Ald814_fp_lSW0CKxJKwpw;I stayed here for NYE for two nights. It might have been a bad time to choose this particular hotel, but I still dont think I'll be going back. The staff seemed more worried about their hair and Armani  than anything else.  When you walk off the street into the dark "trendy" lobby, it all just feels a little silly. We had a view of a back side of some building, and a little slice of Millenium Park. Whatever, views arn't a huge deal to me. The rooms were nice, I was a big fan of the bathroom. But...But..David Bowie was in our hotel room. On some sort of ...mirror. It was odd. If the staff hadn't been so "better than thou" it would have made the stay much better. The best staff people we encountered were the room service staff. They were great.;3;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1666;5/18/2008;MHcFDE3DS;hYvZXUaDUPudb21C4BPgXw;Overall, I wasn't too impressed with my stay. The rooms could use more sound proofing and a furniture upgrade. I had an unimpressive view of a office building and got a wake up call that I didn't ask for or need. They could also use a concierge upgrade. On the plus side, they offer free high-speed WI-FI, the location is solid, the rooms clean and the exercise room is decent.;2;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1668;7/24/2009;DJQ4jGD;owXmoKr4IvXbrAZeDQGNQA;Stayed for 1 night in July 2009 and it was great!  The hotel is in the Carbon & Carbide building, a beautiful example of Art Deco architecture.  Our room was surprisingly large and was well-decorated in muted grey tones in a Dwell Magazine style.  We lucked out and had a nice view of the city.  Our bathroom was sleek, but only had a large shower stall instead of a full tub.  The hotel's location is perfect--steps from Millennium Park, the Loop, the Chicago River, and several metro and train lines. The staff was helpful--especially Concierge Paula Nascimento, as she went out of her way to help us find a late night eatery when we were out-and-about at 10pm on a Sunday night and were calling her on a cell phone...She went the extra mile and checked in with several places to see who was still open and pointed us to a beautiful restaurant/bar called Chaise Lounge in Bucktown (http://chaiseloungechica…).  Truly a great call! The Hard Rock's rates were very reasonable if you book on http://hotels.com.  In the past, we've also stayed at the Allerton Hotel and the Palmer House, both of which we liked.  Overall, however, I would rank the Hard Rock on top, as it really gets the details right and has just the right amount of "coolness" to make your stay feel special.;5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1669;5/18/2010;-T2DrKE9alIGyw-0rJBFxA;qNcpTFx1iYMKD51eDYmk3g;Excellent service, all employees so nice and friendly.  Treat you like a rock star (sorry to sound cliche).  Rooms are loads of fun...instead of cheesy hotel artwork, there's photos of your favorite rock stars and memorabilia.  Awesome HDTVs in rooms. Location is great. Hotel is really neat.  I would say only for 60 years old and younger.  Views are great if you stay in the tower. I also tried out a few awesome Gibson guitars (for free) that the Hard Rock has for guests to use.  I know there's a ton to do in Chicago and I did it, but c'mon, this is fun stuff and can be done in between sight-seeing, before dinner, etc. Only negatives: Lighting could have been better in the room...especially at night! AND, be careful to not touch or move anything in the in-room bar like the snacks, sodas,etc.  A sensor will say that you ate/drank an item when you didn't.  I wanted to put a water bottle in the fridge and moved items to do so!  It supposedly happens all the time, but the front desk should warn you about that as $50 of extra charges were on my bill when I took nothing!  The front desk removed the charges and understood what happened.;5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1670;8/28/2011;CPoMN4U6Jh0N71eyVlWKGg;3vTrJ6BybKpsv1vp0Hgk9Q;Okay, not going to talk about parking because parking is just bad everywhere and you will pay a lot to do it.  'nuff said!  I guess the hotel is a good idea in concept but the execution is poor.  The rooms are tiny as are the bathrooms and the amenities are cheap compared to similarlly priced hotels.  The front desk staff is friendly in an icey kind of way which was a surprise because this is not an exclusive hotel....far from it.  It actually reminds me of a cheap European hotel in decor and amenities. They have the obligatory Hard Rock Shop for your trinkets and clothes.  The dining room breakfast buffet is aweful for the price.  However, if you aren't too concerned about your comfort while you are in Chicago this hotel is in a great location and there is a Starbucks just a block away!;2;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

During our two day stay at Hard Rock, to satisfy our midnight craving and thirst my boyfriend and I wanted to check out what's in the mini bar and the drawers but nothing really caught our interest so we decided to head out in stead. Next morning before our check out, we were charged for things we didn't even use! The front desk agent said it was a mistake, and that the mini bar and the drawers are sensitive to touch! What the heck is that??? I think that's kind of absurd.;3;2;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1673;4/7/2009;fdfLQ2SyDpvntBwiOiu-rA;ILz8ApVEgTqbv5LnC6PyuA;I'd definitely stay here again. They've got a great restaurant in the building, nicely decorated rooms and a convenient location. My only complaint was the music options in the room. You would think the hard rock hotel would at least have some way to play your iPod in the room. But no. They did have a 6 disc CD changer and Sony receiver, but unfortunately I didn't bring my CD collection with me to the hotel. Come on guys, its 2009, the least you could do is offer up one of those clock radios that has a dock for an ipod. It's a minor complaint, but I'd really expect a hotel who's theme is music to not be stuck in the 1990s. Next time I guess I'll bring a few Pixies and Dinosaur Jr CDs so I can at least use their equipment...;4;1;1;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA
1674;12/20/2009;Nw2UJrEWdspM4JegZcdCqg;SHBvwBxSe63SXikjX1vrTw;Kinda has a rock star feel/appeal to it....which works, if you're feeling like a rockstar. ironically enough i was hanging with the amigos, who also were in town and ready to party like rockstars for one more nite in 2009. The top suite was the seen for this rowdy group, which didnt seem big enough, although it was very slickly designed. We had a great view, and the lounge, lobby, and adjoining bar made the scene complete for our big night out to see Sister Hazel. It wasn't anything super special, just looked good and over-priced...plus I think we were expecting the suite from the Hangover movie...minus the tiger, I guess. In any event, it did the job, and the chick at the desk after the show (around the 12:30-1am time frame) was unbelievably helpful and nice...just like everyone, the staff was always amazingly helpful.;4;1;1;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

But this past weekend while pre-gaming it in the birthday room, we heard another party going on a few doors down-WOW OMG CRAZY!!!

1677;1/23/2012;J6LMIzOwC1aBhVY2ewDK-A;c4CPwSUw9x3nfrVkwjRbfA;I stayed in the tower suite for the weekend of my birthday (Fri. 1/20-Sun. 1/22). The suite is fabulous and affordable. It's a one bedroom with the living area in the front and bedroom in the rear.  There are plenty of windows which give you a view of Millennium Park from the living room. One of the best things about the Hard Rock is that most of the staff are music fans so they are laid back and lots of fun.  In particular, Demetrius (DT), who served as a bell hop, bouncer and all around friendly face/host really made us feel welcomed by remembering our names and checking to ensure that we had what we needed. While there, I received a great bottle of wine the first night, turn down service, a comp drink at the bar and free pool games and music in the lobby. I highly recommend that Hard Rock Hotel if you are looking for a comfortable, friendly place to stay where music and enjoying life are the vibe and lifestyle.;5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

We had a two double bed room, with three people.  It is an average size, clean, and has nice decor.  I was surprised there was a high def wide screen TV, but I'm sure a lot of upscale, big city hotels are probably moving towards having them standard.  The climate control was fine, and the room was quieter than we expected for a city.  The valet, bell boy and front desk personnel were polite, helpful and professional.  The elevators are quick.  Something to consider is to go to each floor to see special items from bands.  I wouldn't do it, but several other people were doing it. A shirt and a guitar from Prince was on our floor by the elevator. We had the buffet breakfast 2 mornings in a row at the China Grill restaurant, which is attached.  The staff is abundant, professional and polite. This hotel has a nice location.  Grant Park is one block away.  Cabs and public transportation are available.  There is a free trolley nearby that goes to Navy Pier.   This is within walking distance of Bank of America Theater, if  you don't mind walking about 8 blocks.  We did it in maybe 15 minutes.;4;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

Also, the bar downstairs sucks. Service is awful and they play techno at a Hard Rock place.  Makes no sense.  Other than that this place is awesome.  Also, if you play guitar, they will let you borrow some really cool ones- as long as they have your credit card number.  One guy showed us a $6,000 guitar.  Don't drop that!;4;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1689;6/10/2008;JIJVVsaV45Qrkg6rFDzqVA;hGeXKYWkqJgFC1u_Sh6kCg;I stayed at the Hard Rock for 2 days and have to say the hotel is nice and has a cool look to it. But like so many people have said it does indeed have dimly lit rooms and equally dim hallways. But as two brothers on a trip to see Chicago it did not bother us. I can see how it would bother a woman trying to do her make up since it is darker than the usual hotel room. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Good view of the marina city buildings (aka the corn on the cob twin buildings) from room 811. It is located in a nice area of downtown Chicago with Millennium Park just 5 minutes away and close to many boat tours on Wacker Drive. We were granted a late check out (1pm instead of noon) so that was nice for us since our flight was not until 5pm. The hotel also has free wifi internet which was a nice touch since so many 4 star hotels charge for 24 use of their internet. I used the concierge to check into my airline and print out my boarding passes. They were quick with getting them for me as I checked out. I do agree with the previous post that paying more than $100-$150 a night is not worth it. But then again thats because I got this for $100 a night off of priceline. I could not imagine paying the $250 a night they wanted through their website. Even with the $25 itunes gift card offer thats just too much to pay for a room. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and I would definitely stay here again. But next time I'd prefer the Beatles floor (4th floor), we got stuck with Cheap Trick (8th floor).;3;0;1;1;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

1693;6/1/2012;yfYmLtWX6W4767sMxFpjKg;RMHG_viMG5tXS9E5qzJfSw;The best thing about this place is its location.  We stayed here recently for a museum-filled weekend, and, even though we had to battle the blusterous wind and oppressive heat, the walk through Grant Park to the museum campus was always pleasant.  It's also an easy walk to Navy Pier, Willis Tower, and other attractions.  If walking isn't your thing, though, catching a cab on Michigan Ave right outside the hotel is always a breeze.  It's also just a block or two from Yolk, which is a must for early breakfasts. The pool was nice, and there's a fitness room that seemed fairly well-equipped, aside from the fact that there was only one treadmill. One thing we liked was that each floor has a Chicago theme (ours was The Art Institute), which was charming.  The decor throughout the hotel is faded art deco, and I'm a sucker for that kind of thing. If you're staying for longer than a weekend, though, this place might not be adequate.  Unless you get a suite (which we didn't do), the rooms have no microwaves and other things that come in handy for longer stays.  Also, there's no pay-per-view, and the available channels on the television are limited.  This is something I wouldn't typically complain about (who wants to watch TV on vacation?), but when you've got small kids, like I do, and their sleeping patterns are disrupted by travel, or if it rains, a movie is a good way to spend a little down time. We didn't visit the restaurant attached because it was very much not kid friendly.  There were plenty of other dining options close by, though. Overall, it was great for a place to sleep and to hop in the pool to cool off, which is all I need for a few days.  For a longer stay, I'd probably pick someplace else, especially with kids.;3;1;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

1695;8/9/2011;X5Qw3ijhyyyy-rO6sP8p8g;-e5VFAI-WBHBL7PFMNArDg;This is a great location when it comes to accessing Grant and Millennium parks or the Museum Campus. This is why you stay at the Essex Inn. It's several blocks to the L unless you want to take the bus or taxi. They offer a complimentary limited service shuttle to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile and the Museum Campus throughout the day. The exterior is a steel and glass modern structure with a huge neon sign and stands out a bit (easy to find) from the other stone and brick buildings along Michigan Ave. The lobby has a modern feel, but the carpet is a tropical dated thing of the past. It just doesn't match the lobby furnishings, the new hotel restaurant (Tribute) and the renovated guest rooms. They have nice amenities like the 4th floor rooftop deck, indoor pool and gym. The deck's garden is gorgeous with nice flowering beds and small trees for shade. It overlooks Michigan Ave and has nice views of skyscrapers in both directions. It's great if you just want to listen to the bands from Grant Park during Lollapalooza. The standard king room is decent size with modern decor. The hotel and rooms are clean overall. The housekeeping staff are very accommodating and pleasant. The front desk staff are nice and customer focused - they took care of us in recommending restaurants and addressing room needs. (especially Ryan and Reggie at the front desk). It's not a luxury or budget hotel, but it is comfortable, offers the basics, great room prices and great access to the parks. During Lollapalooza, they bring in additional security and take additional measures to make sure that guests are comfortable, safe and enjoy a pleasant stay. It is a perfect location for Lolla and isn't a party hotel.;4;2;1;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1696;11/30/2008;sBP5EBZfaCNyHXqCNkh44A;GG7Xg-09i2RCSily3JYHtQ;Pros: the location is stellar (right on Michigan Ave, by Grant Park & Millennium Park, and an easy walk downtown), beds are uber-comfy, rooms are clean, staff is very friendly, and they have a big pool & exercise room Cons: the initial price is pretty cheap for a downtown hotel (we paid $80/night), but the additional fees were kind of bogus -- $36 for mandatory valet per day/night, and an additional fee for holding our bags past check out time (I've never been charged for this before at any of my previous hotel stays).. after tacking those on, the "low" price wasn't as big of a draw Overall: I'd definitely stay here again for comfort & convenience, though I'd look around for cheaper prices;4;1;1;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1697;9/7/2007;v6Rgslf;FnrInTxuy5LY3vEHP8IzpQ;I have some mixed emotions about the esSEX inn (juvenile, I know, but it makes me laugh).  It was in a great location, walking distance from Millennium Park and some other sites.  And I guess for the price, I shouldn't have expected much. The first night teh boy and I stayed in our own single room.  It was nice and cozy (and by cozy I mean really small).   The rest of our stay in Chicago we were in a bigger room with a few other friends.  And  the air conditioner started leaking.  We let the front desk know, but nothing was done about it.  By the third day, the carpet was soggy.  It squished when you walked on it.  No big deal if you could avoid it, but there were five of us in the room (one sleeping on the floor) so not a whole lot of room to maneuver around the marsh.   The windows in the room were kind of scary too.  We pretty high up and the windows near the floor just open right up to the sky.  No screens or anything.  Good thing we didn't have a baby toddling around or it might have toddled right out onto Michigan Avenue! The elevators were on the fritz during our stay as well.  Only some of the buttons would work, so if you were on one of the floors that it didn't feel like going to, you had to go past it and walk down a flight or two. The restaurant and bar were a joke, but I guess ok in a pinch.  If you want a drink, I suggest going to the Hilton next door. I sort of hold the esSEX inn close to my heart because it was so awful and just made our trip to Chicago that much more memorable and entertaining.;3;1;1;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1698;7/7/2008;Boh;WPRuJp0BhNdlgYXKZewpDg;probably one of the few reasonably affordable ways to get yourself into a room on Michigan ave. Obviously, the location is great. Walk right out the door to Grant Park. Makes for a nice morning. They also offer a free hotel shuttle to various touristy places like the hancock tower, navy pier and one of the museums, I forget which one. Also nice. There is an indoor pool, fitness center and a deck on the 4th floor that looks out over michigan ave. The rooms are fine, maybe a bit a small. However, the rest of the inside, like the hallways, stairways, are kind of creepy. Internet there is kind of expensive, and probably the most annoying was that our room didn't have a fridge (we ate two huge meals out in chinatown, and since we didn't have a fridge to bring the doggie bag back to, we threw the food out the second night, which was sad, and went into food coma the first night, which was painful and gross). Oh yes, and agree with the reviewer below that the mandatory valet parking thing was kinda annoying.;3;2;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1699;6/30/2011;iIg0HeYZCWtdUzLzchCxBg;zxMR33ahIM5xOxH33GK4jQ;I was in a crunch, needing to book a Chicago hotel room the night before I arrived without any idea where to go, and the Essex Inn came through for me.  Kind of. Located in the South Loop it's within walking distance to the Art Institute and Millennium Park (both a must). However, there is really nothing within the immediate area and you'll have to go at least a mile to get good food. The hotel itself is, well, dated. But, on the upside, you're in Chicago and shouldn't be spending that much time in your hotel anyways. The décor in the entry and lounge area is very, very, very 80s. Clearly their embracing it because the music was basically Raspberry Beret, Just Died in Your Arms and various Duran Duran songs on loop. Given that you basically have to wait 20 minutes for an elevator (which is already a tiny slice of hell) I think this may constitute a verbal assault. The overall feel of the place is that is maybe trendy at some point 20 to 30 years ago and is clutching to it in a fairly depressing way. Hallways are a bit dim. The breakfast was just sad and pathetic. Nothing can be salvaged:I suggest you go down the street to Yolk. The room itself was decently sized, borderline tight, but I could see it being just too small if you wanted to fit 3 or 4 people in. The bathroom was one of those small ones where opening and closing the door becomes a total production. The shower pressure was pretty abysmal and sometimes the water wouldn't heat up until the second shower (it wasn't winter either), but they had good shampoos and soaps (which I totally didn't take with me...). Wifi was so-so. The heater/AC was possibly from the 50s and was entirely dysfunctional.   The people were friendly in that Mid-Western sort of way. I paid around $160/night with taxes.  It was fine since I booked last minute, but you can absolutely find better hotels for better prices in Chicago.;2;2;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

1701;1/20/2010;Xb0GLSMgcd;T2qwK2vzS4YxJZrbjbTJuw;Enjoyed my stay!  I was here for business and thought this place was just perfect.  My room was comfortable - great bed, big desk and a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was small, but I have come to expect that in city hotels.  I did laugh because it had the tiniest sink I had ever seen in a bathroom.  The staff was very helpful and nice.  I had trouble trying to print my return boarding pass in their business center, the gentleman at the desk took care of it for me without blinking and eye. Nice stay and would definitely stay there again.;4;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1702;10/18/2010;abkvbiMn7MCw26eYcLzq4A;bQycLIsNYtwMddx6N6AiDQ;Well, its over priced compared to the Hilton next door. Our room was dirty, the bathroom was small, there is no heater or air conditioner for the room, but rather a fan where it should be. The couch in the "suite" was gross and uncomfortable. There was something all over the phone, things coming off the walls, and no handles on the closet. I think you get the picture, so if I were you, I wouldn't stay here.;2;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1703;4/30/2011;ltnvD8FO8upbGjEheOaDdQ;-QNqU6eeHw4t2q3b1f0b4g;Stayed here for 6 nights during the last week of April, 2011.  My wife and I were traveling with our 2 kids, aged 3 1/2 and 9 months.  Now, you have to understand, the main thing about this hotel is the location.  You're not booking a room at the Ritz or the Waldorf/Astoria.  It serves very well as a functional hotel, but if you're looking for 5 star quality, look elsewhere. Having said all of that, we enjoyed our stay here.  The location is on Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park.  We booked through Expedia (if I remember right) and got the room for around $120 per night (average...remember, we checked in on a Friday).  We got a room on the 4th floor (14 floors total in the place).  The prior reviews are correct, the room is small...compared to other hotels out there.  If you want to stay in your room the whole time, seek elsewhere.  Our family of 4 was crammed, but we had what we needed.  There is a mini-fridge hidden under the TV (hint:  you can adjust the temperature using the thermostat on the back of the fridge).  There is a coffee bar too so you can brew your own java.  There's a flat-panel TV with plenty to choose from (several HBO channels included).  The sink in the bathroom is no myth...it's SMALL.  It's a round sink:I'd put it at about 10 inches in diameter (no exaggeration here...it's about as big as a soccer ball).  That said, it does it's job...it's a sink people, not a hot tub!  Speaking of tubs, there's one in the room (but it lacks jets, so it's just a tub, not a "hot" tub).  The shower head needs an upgrade on the water pressure.  My theory is that there's a pressure reducer in there, but that's just a theory...you decide for yourself.  The toilet also does it's job well.  Our room was on the Hilton side of the building, towards the rear of the hotel, so we had a decent view of the Sears (or whatever it's called these days) Tower.  We were pleased with the room. The staff were very nice throughout our stay.  The housekeeping folks were a little bland, but still tended to our needs (they were like mashed potatoes with no salt & pepper added).  The valet guys were good to us.  The daily parking rate was $37.  That may sound excessive, but the Hilton next door is $55 per day.  We were there for 6 days, so...do the math! The hotel restaurant was undergoing renovations while we were there, so we were provided a "complimentary" continental breakfast.  Now, we all know what "complimentary" means here:  the price is included in your room rate, so you'd better get down here every morning and scarf down all the pastries & coffee you can consume...AND WE DID JUST THAT!  Seriously though, they could have provided nothing for breakfast, so we were glad to get what we got. There is an indoor pool at the Essex with a lifeguard on duty during regular pool hours.  The pool is "heated", and by this I mean "not outside temperature".  They have a chart with the pool temperature for guests to see.  The average during our stay was 82 fahrenheit, but I disagree...I think "lukewarm" says it all.  In any case, the pool is small, but adequate.  There is also a sauna in the pool area, but sadly, no steam room.  The do pipe in good music in the pool area too (mainly classic rock that isn't too "classic rock"...i.e. Freebird/Foghat/ACDC/etc).  The exercise room is very good too.  There's 3 bike machines, 3 treadmills, 2 or 3 Elliptical machines, plus several weight machines.  There are a few TV's to watch while working out. As stated in the beginning, the location of this place is key.  Grant Park is across the street, there's a Red Line train stop that's less than a 3-block walk away...you're staying on Michigan Avenue for Pete's sake!  There are several places to eat within a 5-block walk as well.  All in all, we enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone that isn't too picky about the actual hotel they're staying at.  Enjoy your trip!;4;2;1;2;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1704;7/25/2010;fhfEJC2--isYxVd8tjBUTQ;k3Mc-p-JjO0XflbQuj_dFQ;Dear General Manager, I stayed at the Essex in June on a business trip. I ordered room service quite a bit and it came to my attention that the busboys were not getting the 16% gratuity charged to me. I find this abhorrent, dishonest to the guests, and exploitative to the staff. It also puts the guests in an uncomfortable situation as  the busboys are looking / expecting a tip that is advertised as inclusive in the menu. Please immediately look into this situation and make sure that this practice is stopped as soon as possible. I'm posting this information on yelp, so other visitors to Chicago do not inadvertently get taken advantage of, or contribute to the exploitation of people who work in the service industry.;2;2;1;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1705;8/7/2007;RHs4OHW64ESRHBAf4sIaWA;FIeFpt3dOxr1JPq-1iaSag;Five stars for the service and value aspect.  It's not a "five star hotel."  It's not the Ritz.  But as a choice for out-of-towners for a downtown wedding - this seems like a good choice.  At least it is for me - we secured a rate with them for next year for a wedding that is almost half the cost of the other rates of local Michigan Ave hotels.  Consider the hotel is a little outdated - currently a renovation (soft remodel) is planned for December thru March of next year.  They'll be updating the rugs, rooms, walls, floors, lobby, etc.  The rooms are currently clean, efficient, perfectly placed on Michigan Ave - and the hotel has a shuttle that will take you up and down Michigan Ave throughout the day.  They also have a pool with a lifeguard which is in an atrium.  It's not the Ritz, but if you don't need your shoes shined - it works.;5;2;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1706;7/29/2008;YlbrTbX5N7KAIJhq00MKtw;qtE59RKEer5zTr-i7mSGtA;Oops, they failed to cancel our prior reservation and charged us for two stays.  They refused to give us a confirmation number when we changed the date because "they don't use confirmation numbers", yet they screwed it up.  We didn't know until after our stay.  Two stars off for you, Essucks Inn;2;0;0;1;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
1707;9/10/2012;Mbcwu6Z0sZQc0JiSyUEdyg;MyRkSyp5BwHqfu58FZ6Iyw;Overall rating 3.5 stars.   Our Chicago trip was so amazing.  Hot as hell, but amazing and fun!  Hotel is very nice and conveniently located in downtown Chicago which is within walking distance of everything, shopping, eating, bars, desserts, you name it.  Staff seem to be quite friendly.  It was my first time in Chicago and it was such a culture shock for me when we arrived at this hotel.  The lobby looks big and spacious.  Then as you are sitting there waiting for the elevators to get to your room...well, that's a different story.  The elevators takes some time before it actually gets to you, hallways are super small and cramped, and the rooms as cute and quaint as they are, they are really tiny.  It's not a usual hotel that I've ever stayed at before, but at least I know now, next time I do come to Chicago, this is what to expect.  Rooms were always kept clean by the housekeepers, which is a definite plus.  Prices are ehh, could be a little bit cheaper, I think for such a small space.  The bed was definitely comfortable though, which is always a plus for me.  I'm big for lounging on the bed so I love having a nice comfy bed with soft pillows and this place had that. Keep in mind that this is an older hotel that has kept their history, so I think renovating or remodeling may be out of the question for them.   The gym is on the very top floor of this hotel, and you have to climb up some stairs in this old creepy stairwell, with steep steps to get to it.  It kinda scared me to tell you the truth, but once you get there, it had pretty much all the gym equipment that you needed, which was nice.  If you are looking for a view while working out though, don't expect it.  There are housekeepers that come and clean the gym as you are there too, so you don't have to worry about the gym being all nasty and dirty.  I know some people don't like to wipe machines down after using them, I guess you don't have to worry about that so much here because the staff keeps it pretty sanitized.   I'd come back and stay again for the convenience.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1708;9/24/2012;dgqX3Ed6VbnOdc3rGHluFA;MfE0c-0abGJiBcHhGnYmzw;We hosted our wedding (ceremony and reception) at the Allerton Hotel in August, 2012. We were beyond satisfied with the level of service and hospitality offered. At all stages of the wedding (tour, food tasting, planning, and wedding day), the hotel treated us as though we were the top priority. The event space (Tip Top Tap Room) is absolutely gorgeous with amazing views of the lake and Michigan Avenue. We received complements from everyone at how classy the event space was. The food was excellent: We opted for late night stations which were a big hit. Much of the success is undoubtedly attributable to the extreme hard work, professionalism, and responsiveness of the hotel designated even planners (Beau Buttacavoli and Katie Hultin). They are clearly experts at what they do and understand the importance of quality and customer service in the hospitality industry;5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

The food = AMAZING..from our mother/daughter lunch at the M Lounge to our hordeuves, 1st, 2nd, 3rd courses, wedding CAKE (MMM!) and our brunch on Sunday in the Buckingham room...all of our family and friends cleaned their plates and had nothing but rave reviews about the food....delicious!!!!!  Even this bride got a chance to enjoy each course thanks to a fabulous happy hour where I spent time mingling with our 140 guests while munching on baby lamb chops.. We are big foodies... :) Service = best I've ever seen at a wedding reception!  The staff was on top of everything and the courses were served and removed with out anyone having to wait...food was hot and delicious and each table was eating at the same time as our head table was eating.  No one was at need for a drink either :) Great servers & bartenders! Hotel = gorgeous...what can I say?  We had the most beautiful reception room (Tip Top Tap) and everything was how we had dreamed but MORE spectacular!!  It surpassed our expectations and I am forever grateful to Beau B. for helping our vision come to reality.  Oh and our wedding suite that night was amazing....we walked in to classical music playing, dimmed lights, rose petals leading to our bedroom, chocolate covered strawberries, delish & chilled champagne and even some slices of our wedding cake :) SO special!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only downfall? One elevator was out of service...but it gave us an excuse to use the stairs between floors 17-21 and gave us a little exercise from all of that food. :) THANKS ALLERTON!  We love you guys and can't wait for our 1-year anniversary to see you again for breakfast in bed and a freshly made wedding cake! MMM..told you that we love our food :);5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1710;5/15/2012;AIe3KhbZ4vINMRU6huFcDQ;Nvpx9fUIAB3oddqgRLEPfg;i love the location of the Hotel this is why I'm coming back again, I'm not familiar with Chicago enough to try another location. I've stayed here once last year for the long weekend, and planning on coming back again for the Victoria day long weekend May 19-21. the standard rooms are tiny, but its really well decorated, I felt it wasn't worth the extra $30 bucks per night upgrade if I had to pay $50 per night for parking already! They are charging a ridiculous $50 per night for parking, I called in and ask if we could get the parking for cheaper, the staffed just said I would have to use public parking and walk over, no help, didn't say how far it was either.;2;2;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1711;6/25/2012;wATYguUwWzZYV9eZMBXBwg;z-08626Q7y-14JoONYOZ-w;The Allerton's only advantage:LOCATION. It is central to everything and smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave. Until my recent experience, I had never encountered problems with this hotel. The woman, who checked us in one evening, was very rude and did not offer any room upgrade alternatives (i.e., upgrading to a king suite) to accomodate 3 adults when I discussed my initial needs. Instead, she was standoffish, short, and unhelpful, providing us with keys to room that did not fit our needs with helping to identify a fitting solution. Upon walking into the room, we realized how small it was and called down to the front desk to ask for other options from another woman, which the woman in the beginning should have suggested to us before hauling all of our luggage upstairs and having to come back down.  I was glad we got to upgrade for an additional $35/night, which is no problem. My other complaints was that Valet service was not available when I arrived and we had to double-park and go inside to get somebody to assist us. The elevators are also very small. I have been charged an additional fees on my debit card:I have called the front desk and been fowarded to the accounting center several times where I have left only 2 voicemails requesting that someone call me back. I am dissapointed and frustrated with the level of service provided by this hotel, beginning from check-in to even after the hotel stay- which I am still dealing with a week after my check-out date. No one has contacted me from the hotel yet. For the level of dissatisfaction I have experienced, I do not plan to use this hotel in the future and nor will I recommend it to anyone else.;2;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

The elevator are a little strange.  It's like they have a mind of there own. lol;3;1;1;2;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

1715;6/23/2012;zNML8zzXqT9KDBmLxBfJIw;iVk5L0JWf_92isJK9JWpwA;We were staying in Chicago for a friend's wedding and wanted a hotel in the heart of things and the Allerton definitely fit the bill -- the location was perfect for us and enabled us to do a lot of exploring on foot. Rooms aren't large but were clean and pretty. We didn't have a view to speak of BUT they did give us a free upgrade to a king without being asked, which was very nice. While I was waiting to meet up with a friend I had a drink at the bar which was very pleasant. The main lobby is on the 2nd floor so it is a little off-putting when you arrive at the ground floor and aren't quite sure where to go but the staff was pretty helpful. Also appreciated the coffee in the lobby. It was a little pricier than our usual hotel budget but for a splurge it was definitely worth it. Bell hop was very helpful.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1716;2/12/2012;ySvtc7DuNSkg7uqyIHQWYw;EDSXiVU0aMfGqhgBfNd-jg;The location was fantastic.  The room was great - spacious, comfortable, attractive decor.  The free Wi-Fi was nice, as the 3G signal in the area was at a crawl.  We used a Groupon and I was asked to login at the front desk rather than being allowed to use my iPhone app so we could print the voucher, which I wasn't terribly comfortable doing. So why am I giving The Allerton only two stars?  Two words: hot water.  As in, there was none at all the morning we checked out.  Not even at 11 a.m.  (Luckily, all we had on the agenda after checking out was schlepping to the airport.)  When I mentioned this at check-out, I was first mistaken for someone else that had called down to complain about the hot water situation, then unapologetically informed that 300 other people had checked out this morning.   Really?  You're a hotel.  The two very basic things you provide are a bed and a shower.;2;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1717;3/12/2012;PIB7X-dHmhNqibxFKyWNbg;27d1brUbY_dU-I4KaBZ9Xw;The staff has been very kind and helpful, the location is right in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Some of the rooms are rather small and having stayed here 30+ times now I think I can confidently say that every room is a different shape. There are rooms I don't like and rooms I like very much and a few that are best described as "unusual" (which are on my list of rooms to avoid). While some of the rooms near the elevators are small, some in the corners are very large, these are my favorites. I've traveled here enough that I know some of the waitstaff in the restaurant, they are always kind and say good morning even when they are not assigned to serve my table. The breakfast buffet is good, but doesn't run every day. I'd like the wait staff to be a little faster with the check, but I've learned to judge the time. In year's past I've spend 100s of nights with Marriott so I do miss having loyalty points that I can spend when I bring the family with me. If you want a place to stay that's in a terrific location to shop and eat on  the Magnificent Mile you should definitely check them out.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1718;1/6/2012;-TKFsqsvkpaKk7XfVbAgnw;IjD4OCS3lHlVtgJeLsWyiQ;We used a Living Social voucher for our one night stay. We had a couple issues getting here, it was hard to find while driving since the sign for the hotel is at the top of the building and not by the awning outside. We also weren't sure which parking garage to park in for our parking to be validated. We could have had our car valet  but the valet spot in front was small and taken up by taxi's. We just drove around and pulled our car into the garage ourselves. The lobby is small but nice looking.  The diner was closed each time we came by the front desk. There is a bar right there and it was warm and inviting.  All the staff we encountered were friendly. The standard room is just that, standard. The room was tiny, no coffee pot and certainly not as clean as I would have expected it to be. At first glance, the room looks clean but the bathroom looked like the only thing that had been done was fresh towels added. The counter that runs along the top of the sink was dirty, not dusty but dirty. There were pieces of "something" just laying there, not even wiped off. The same with the floor, didn't look like it had been swept. We spent most of our time in the city walking around and seeing the lights. Therefore, the lack of cleanliness wasn't a prime factor in our visit. We were here long enough to get dressed for dinner, sleep and dress for the next day. We took advantage of the late checkout to keep our bags in the room instead of walking around Chicago with them. The Living Social voucher also came with 2 free drinks. We had to ask for the coupons because they were not given to us at the time of check-out.  We asked the bartender for the two free drinks and it turned out that it was a fruity drink with Malibu rum. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. Overall, for the price and location on Magnificent Mile, I would stay here again. I would probably ask for  a bigger room this time and would like my bathroom to be clean.;4;1;0;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1719;9/26/2011;-OiglL;R_S07piLpe_LHU0yKyYOzg;This hotel is centrally located on Michigan Avenue right near all the shops (Apple store right next door, Walgreens right up the street, Trader Joe's & Garrett's Popcorn down two blocks).  Very convenient to load up on water and snacks for your room while you call Allerton Hotel your home for the duration of your stay in the Windy City. Between the six of us in our group, we had three different types of rooms.  I lucked out and paid $104/night for our king suite.  The guys had a two double bed room (decent size) and our other friends got a teeny-tiny queen size petite room.  It's all good though, we only picked this spot for the convenience of its location and the awesome deal we got through TravelZoo's website. I must say, this was the swiftest check-in and check-out at any hotel I've been at. When we arrived at 2:00 after taking a cab from Chicago Midway, we were quickly greeted by the front desk and was able to check into our room right away.  Awesome. We hung out at the lounge a few times to grab a cocktail and some happy hour food. Five stars for having a $5 menu and for having nightly drink specials.   I loved the $5 flavored-vodka special they had on a particular night. The room was kept clean so no complaints there.  We had our own mobile hot spot device so we didn't have to pay to have wifi access in our room, but getting a strong signal between all the buildings was quite the challenge.  Oh well, free wifi in the lounge if you ask the front desk for the access code. Overall, I loved the Allerton Hotel.  I have no complaints since it served its purpose well in the four nights we stayed there and provided a great deal that fit within our budget.  The room wasn't big enough to store a dresser, so I ended up keeping most of my clothes in my suitcase since I had no where else to put it.  Oh well, I still managed. If I return back to Chicago, I know I would not hesitate to stay here again.;4;3;3;2;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1720;2/23/2012;lyV3mmEMLoc6vsNV6lO4Hg;zBLwbe5C3hC7F5Jij4BxVQ;I stayed at this hotel last weekend and it was a mixed experience.  Perhaps I should have done more research before choosing to book here but my family had had a good experience a few years back so I trusted their opinion. The valet parking was more than we would have liked to spend.  Thankfully, I knew of a parking structure a few blocks away that was less expensive. The elevators were so tiny and besides the lobby, the whole place looked old school to the point of run down. I like a good old school hotel but this was to the point of it looking like it wasn't well kept. The bedroom was fine but had a lot of window dressing in my opinion.  The bed was comfy but the carpeting had some issues.  The shower had rust spots and made me question the cleanliness of the bathroom. Overall, it was a decent experience but I think we would either upgrade our room or look for other options.   I can't give it a great rating but won't give it a horrible rating either. PRO'S: Proximity to Michigan Ave Lobby Area CON'S: Check in on the 2nd floor (fairly confusing) Cleanliness of the bathroom Price of Parking;3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1721;10/25/2011;W2gL5WYS4vBSgVO5Koqldg;HpR-MJc3urSoiSloWfSwiw;Prologue: So this is a belated YELP post, because I have only recently grown to know & love the YELP community.  It was during this trip in April, that I first discovered YELP. I was solo, and YELP was my travel companion! I therefore felt compelled to copy & paste my April post from another community forum so that my fellow yeeps could benefit..... Having stayed here previously in a very small room, I was sure to ask for a larger room with 2 beds when I made the reservation although I was a solo traveler. I had room 1618 and it was very good. Their website reservations are very clear about the square footage of each room - so pay attention when you book so you don't end up an unhappy traveler. There are some rooms that are TINY, TINY.  Dollhouse-like! Location: Excellent, excellent. In the middle of the Mag Mile. Need I say more? Rooms: No tub in mine - only a shower. Counter space was very limited - just a shelf below the mirror. Room had 2 flat screen tvs, sofa, chair, coffee table and desk. Free internet. Mini bar, but no refrigerator or coffee maker that you can use in room. Full length mirror and in room safe. Lobby: Elevators are quite small, but there are 3 available. Check in is on the 2nd floor. One computer on 2nd floor you can use to print your boarding passes. Service: I had very limited contact with any staff - so I can't venture an opinion. Food: I was so close to dozens of restaurants that I did not eat at the hotel. I would definitely stay here again, BUT will surely ask for a big room again;4;2;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1722;9/14/2011;XTJ5f-IZOSz0HNLAFkj1BA;My5dub-zdWfZclKnzIxZ-Q;Location, location, location! This nicely renovated hotel sits right in the middle of all the hub-bub on the Magnificent Mile. If you are a tourist, or simply love to be in the middle of everything, this is a good choice. I enjoyed my stay here very much. I noticed a lot  of room size complaints.. I didn't feel my room was small but I did get a King size. It was big enough for two people and all their stuff for a long weekend Chicago adventure with friends. We weren't there except to sleep, shower, and get jazzy looking to go out. Only complaint, was that the shower drain had HAIR in it. EEEEW. GROSS. That is a huge negative. Aside from that the room was clean. Toiletries were minimal, linens fresh and clean, service friendly and hospitable, bar NICE. Also you get complimentarty martini tickets when you check in. I took full advantage.;3;1;0;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1723;9/19/2011;LJx0lHoL4RnkpcdmZBnOpA;uU7GIgzs4-5Dtp9Vuymb3A;The hotel was centrally located near all food and shopping areas. Even though it was an old building, they did a great job on the up-keeping. For a two full size room, it was kind of small and didn't have much room to move around. Their customer service was okay, it was so hard to get anyone during the late hours. I requested for more towels and it never arrived. For about $200 a night, I think there are other hotels around. Overall not too bad.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1724;6/1/2011;UkGqzKy2Sz2JtexDV-Fe9Q;MsLtQW9mk6wQ01cXhUotlg;Came to visit Chicago for the first time for pleasure (actually celebrating Nana's 90th birthday) and the last night in Chicago-  I got to stay at The Allerton Hotel. The family heard that I love to shop which made this hotel perfect because its near everything which is great! It's on Magnificent Mile. Upon entering into the hotel, I was greeted with friendly customer service and the decor in the hotel was really nice. When I checked in, went to my room... I was stun on how spacious my room was. I thought it might be small but it was pretty nice size. This hotel might be my favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago. Love everything about this place. Two thumbs up!!!;4;2;1;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1725;5/4/2012;cSZUBKBg66mWWdq0sTQf1w;zpvnHZmtO87C4f1ZMsU8Uw;My suite was nice and clean, I received free WI-fi, I get the historic nature of the property and liked it, great margarita in the lounge. No coffee maker or microwave in the room was a downer. Over all nice stay & staff. More personal than the Marriott types.;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1726;4/9/2012;8xY8c2bBn6oXA4pi26jnqg;1qgk1_PH3nCfD8pzpS_dUQ;I had a great time here. The rooms were small, but I live in the Northeast, and it's comparable to a New York or D.C. hotel room. I wish they had free wifi. I don't understand places that do NOT have free wifi in today's day and age. But I was able to pick up a rogue signal, or go down to the lounge with my laptop. The staff was very nice. The hotel had so much character. I would definitely stay here again.;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1727;11/5/2011;qeAbEnhBWkpQ5Bv9f-tehg;ZG6c3GaUjBf-wNhSbKYbpA;Gotta say that coming here is like coming home. I stay here a few times a yr  with my mother & 4 yr old nephew and everyone always remembers us. The service here is so warm and gracious. Rooms are large clean and comfortable. The concierge is always helpful. And they are nice to kids :-).;5;1;2;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1728;1/4/2011;b6h3HMfIIyjjqJzYgOLRTw;HgPx2ktVfFvdkGhAFaQQ_Q;Not a big fan. We got it for a decent rate on New Year's Eve ($179), but in comparison to some of the other deals we could have got, it doesn't seem like that great of a deal.  (Hindsight is 20/20.)  We obviously were paying more for the location than anything else. It's clean and in a great location.  However, my biggest beef lies in their customer service.  We checked in around 3pm with another couple, and got our keys.  I then heard the other clerk asking my friends if they minded a full size bed, which they of course did.  When I checked with the clerk who had already checked us in, I discovered that the room also contained a full size bed.  Since I had paid for a queen size on http://hotels.com, I was miffed that they tried to sneak a full size bed on us.  And who has full sized beds anymore? We were told that we'd have to wait till around 5pm, along with many other people, to get a room with a queen sized bed because they were "fully committed".  I'm normally very easy going, but come on - it's New years eve and we've got plans.  So now instead of getting to workout and nap before our dinner resos, we're hurrying. The rooms are tiny and the doors are thin.  We got back around 3am, and our next door neighbors kept throwing things at our door all night.   All in all, I'd only stay here again if I got a great rate, as you can find better deals at better hotels in the area.;2;2;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

1730;2/15/2010;J-VJ1aRvWZca3uvgCA1ifw;0G43iKmKRMdGWcmvfSH7sw;For being a very old hotel--this place looks great and they did a fantastic job remodeling. For being as expensive as the room was, my boyfriend and I were displeased with some things, but were generally happy with what we got. Pros: -BIG TV, and I don't know what the person below me is talking about cause there was definitely free TV. -BIG comfy bed -Decent sized room, the bathroom was tiny, but the room was very well laid out -Quick check in -Great location on Michigan Ave. -Bath and Body Works shampoo and conditioner -Nice shower Cons: -You get charged if you use the fridge (I am noticing this a lot in Chicago hotels, starting to tick me off) -View was the fire escape -NO COFFEE MAKER! -Lights had to be manually turned on, no switch -No continental breakfast -Tiny bathroom All and all, not a terrible place by any means. The room is very swanky and the price wasn't terrible, but we would've at least liked free coffee in our room and the ability to use our fridge without a price attached. I had a wonderful dinner at Tavern that I couldn't bring home cause I wasn't about to pay $25 to use a fridge.;3;4;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1731;3/3/2012;os1VbXO9Dbx7ndFlPZrV7A;g3pUQClm1XCXiYSwsJElfQ;Hello- I sent the following complaint to your hotel on February 12th and still haven't heard back. I am getting very frustrated and would like a response. Yesterday (2/11/12) I used my Groupon for the Allerton Hotel in Chicago. From what I understood, there were a lot of Groupons redeemed this weekend. However, that should not affect my stay. At first I was not going to say anything, but I decided to write because I really do not feel like the value of my stay was worth what I paid for it. When I first arrived, I had to wait more than 25 minutes to check in, in your lobby space that is not equipped for long lines. After I checked in, I had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator because this hotel is NOT equipped for large groups. By the time I finally got to my room, I had already been in the hotel almost an hour. Everytime I had to take the elevator (I was on the 24th floor..stairs were not an option), we had to send someone into the hall first to press the button because it took at least 10 minutes. I understand these are complaints you probably hear often and I know the Allerton is an older hotel. However, because of this, it seems to me like it would be a bad idea to allow all of these Groupons to be scheduled on the same weekend. Other hotels I have used with Groupon have made sure to limit the number redeemed each weekend and that seemed to work well. Our room had not been properly cleaned after the last guests. We wanted to purchase from the mini-bar, but when I opened it there was almost nothing in it. The mini-bar was full of empty wrappers and candy canisters left over from the last guests. I called the Front Desk and was assured I would not be charged for this, but that did not make me feel better. To me, that shows they did not take the proper care in cleaning and makes me wonder what else they didn't clean. From that point on, I felt uncomfortable in the room. Also, whoever was there before us set an alarm for 4am and the housekeeper must not have re-set it or checked because the alarm woke us up at that time this morning. After that, housekeeping came to the room at 9:00am to clean. This made no sense to me, because we only stayed for one night and check out was at 12:00pm. Why would they come that early? This morning, I called ahead for my car at 11:15am. I understood it could take up to 30 minutes. The car didn't arrive until after 12:00pm. Other people in line said they were waiting for over an hour for their car. During this time I waited outside. At no point did the doorman or any of the valet ask me which car was mine or if I had been helped. I am someone who uses Groupon all the time and this was my first bad experience. It will definitely make me think twice before purchasing a Groupon again and I will not be returning to the Allerton.  After telling my parents of this experience, they called and cancelled their reservation as well and will be contacting Groupon for a refund.;1;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1732;8/19/2010;M4oVbp33unRX1FHisTrHRA;n9YwEy5pYspR-uXdAsXbtA;We got a king suite through a really good deal on Expedia, but wow would I have been disappointed if we had paid full price for what we got. The hotel itself is OK (but very small - it's easy to see it's from a different era). When we checked in, the worker said, "I'm going to put you in a suite with two beds." I replied, "King suite?" as that's what we had booked, and she said yes. We got up to our room to find they had put us in with two doubles! When we called the front desk, they said that was an "upgrade" because the room is slightly larger. Yes, it was, but a double bed is no substitute for a king. Eventually we got a new room. It's a cute boutique hotel, but nothing about it screams luxury to me. The front desk was snotty both at check in and check out, the room service was very limited (although that worker was extremely nice), the bellhop/doorman/valets all wouldn't help us find a taxi, and it took almost 20 minutes for the valet to get us our car!! It wasn't even like it was busy or check out time, and the parking garage is right next door. If you can score a great deal, it's might be worth because it's in a good location, but I would never go back.;2;3;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1733;1/1/2007;WbPSlus8-;nHnNraNUct25HJJTRAGYkA;Pros: - Great location in the center of Michigan Ave - Decent rates ($150-$200/night) - Friendly staff Best of all, they have this special 'sleep system' in your room where you are equipped with a sleep CD, eye mask, ear plugs, and lavander linen spray to ensure the best sleep possible! Cons: - No grandeous entrance into the hotel. Door is on Huron, not Mich Ave. - Crazy elevator system. You have to first go to the 3rd floor, which is the real entrance/lobby. Then you have to transfer to another elevator to get up to your room. - Restaurant Taps on Two is sub-par. Do not trust their "Express Lunch"! It takes at least an hour!;4;2;2;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1734;3/29/2011;EQoXcJPZyBT2RZOBwu63ZQ;Is_P4AeKFhDGRX2dx5nHVw;The Allerton had a great staff and everything that you would want in a Hotel.  The location was also handy and the bar and restaurant on the second floor were pretty swanky.   I had read that the rooms were old and small.  It is an old hotel - but recently refurbished.  So all the furnishings and paint are bright and shiny, but yeah, they are small old-school rooms and bathrooms.   Because I suspected this was the case after reading reviews - we stayed in a Jr. Suite.  Still not a huge room - but it really gave us all the space we needed.  The bed was great, room service was prompt.  Front desk and bellmen were helpful.   One Note:  For those of you coming to Chicago and don't realize it - parking is expensive.  We paid $48 a night to park at the Allerton.  The cheapest overnight parking in the area was $36 and a couple blocks away.;4;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1735;5/9/2010;t7SxRTNoUVgT-oj3mtZztg;OwoKr-aMLkrFYBrTRyxfNg;I have stayed here for a weekend here and there with my boyfriend at the time....the second time we stayed here we came back from dinner and drinks to find our door barely open....we checked out the room and everything was fine, nothing missing, but I promptly called security in a rage. Turns out the lock deal wasn't locking properly and after having maintenance come up, past midnight and totally tipsy I might add, he said he couldn't do anything right then that the mechanism would have to be replaced. They upgraded us to a fairly decent suite after I ranted and raved....I felt this still wasn't sufficient seeing that I could have had some very expensive Louis Vuitton and other designed merch snatched out of my room due to their "malfunction" and we wouldn't have any time to really enjoy a suite because we were leaving early the next morning....I complained to a manager at check-out and he was kinda flaky and said well I guess next time you come we can upgrade your room then and I asked well how can I prove you promised me that and he said "I will put a note in your account"...right, I am sure you will buddy. Needless to say, we never returned. The hotel bar however carries Tyku which is a delicious Japanese liquor that pairs great with sprite. The hotel otherwise is decent, but desirable because of its location right off Michigan Ave.;2;1;1;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1736;2/2/2012;SQYm6-FmgowEMxPtzy;HPeqx7Em2pfr0ioZw2Cppg;Stayed here on Dec 17th, to be close to MagMile shopping experience.  Great location, easy walk to shopping, dining, entertainment venues.  Hotel was great, very clean, all personnel was very nice.  Yea, the elevator is slow...and small, yea, some of the rooms are smal tool, but it's a very cute, clean, budget friendly boutique hotel.  I'll go back there again, maybe we even started a tradition of Chicago Christmas shopping?;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1737;1/31/2012;JzNCMyzR;Lw0EWIG6K8hbykd6ATwHew;Enjoying the petite room.  Perfect for a one night stay & single user.  Very helpful & accommodating staff.  Will be back!;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1738;11/2/2008;ktBHTqZ7f2XFdZrgLE56EQ;b9PYv393148RBlfX_b62Sw;The Allerton has a slick interior and accommodating staff.  Although the building was old, they had obviously  sunk a good amount of money renovating the rooms and lobby areas... if only some of that money had been used to better insulate the rooms. I may be slightly biased because I was stuck in a room directly across from the elevators during a completely sold out weekend... but I could hear every single word of every single conversation every single person had while waiting for the elevator at all hours of the night. Awesome. The rooms were a little small, but compared to a "boutique" hotel in, oh let's just say Boston, they were really not bad. Considering the price of the rooms, I feel like they could probably offer free wi-fi but nothing to split hairs over. The gym however, was wonderful. 2 full rooms,  3 treadmills, 2 bikes and a stair machine. 3 weight machines, mats in a mirrored room, free weights and weight benches... all with a nice view of the city. The only complaint is that the two water coolers were empty for the entire 5 days I was there. I would consider staying here again.. if given a different room, I might even be persuaded to give them an additional star.;3;1;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1739;8/17/2009;x-e37cwTe01--z068NGL6w;kdHVgSg6JmchNzWjV_ddXQ;Pro's: Price.  You cant find much of a better deal on Michigan Avenue then you will at The Allerton.  With all applicable fees + taxes our room was $140/night.   Location:  Right in the heart of Chicago.  A short walk to downtown, the river, and all sorts of shopping and restaurants.  Cheap cab ride to the musuems and the Sears Tower/Union Station area. Style:  I love the old school feel of certain hotels so I'm biased, but the Allerton was outstanding in this regard.  After a few drinks in the bar it wouldnt have been a far stetch to visualize it as being the 1920's...except for that whole Prohibition thing. Service:  The front desk attendants were somewhat standoffish, but all other hotel personel were very friendly. Con's: Tempurature:  It was fairly warm in our room and we couldnt lower the thermometer to offset the heat.  It seemed to be an innacurate read.  Overall not too bad, just something we noticed. This all being said I would recommend The Allerton to anyone.  It's a great experience overall.;4;1;0;2;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1740;3/27/2011;eZ7SEKXxBrpqlYSfZA2ipg;HYnyPqhuYC9-JCMFsyjgZg;It's interesting to read some of the other reviews, because I feel like I stayed at a completely different hotel.  That being said, we didn't have an extended stay like some of the negative reviewers, so maybe the place just wears on you after a while. We booked a room through a discount site for a belated anniversary staycation.  The location of the Allerton is excellent, which is primarily why we chose it.  I noted on our reservation that we were celebrating, and upon arrival the front desk agent kindly wished us Happy Anniversary and offered an upgrade at no cost.  So sweet - thank you, Allerton! I expected a teeny tiny room based upon the reviews I've seen here, but we were delighted to find a two room suite (bedroom/living room) with two large screen TV's, a desk, a large bathroom, and a King bed.  I do agree with those folks who say that the toiletries are minimal...no lotion?  I actually mentioned that to my husband, I just assumed they had forgotten ours.  Also, no wash cloths?  That was odd to me, though it certainly wasn't a big deal. We ordered room service for breakfast in the morning, and as per usual in a hotel, the bill was quite high.  The food arrived on time and tasted fine, nothing to write home about.  I do appreciate that they accommodated a couple of special requests.  If I could do it over again, I would not order room service, primarilly for the cost. When we checked out, the front desk staff inquired about our stay, wanted to make sure we were happy, and wished us well.  I genuinely couldn't have asked for a better stay in a better location.;4;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1741;5/3/2010;gntYHJpjBmLtDTQ0U-KI5A;V46Mt3MCaC2lZCI0iu5FwA;Our stay was pleasant.  The rooms are definitely small and our view was a brick wall - but that's to be expected for the reasonable deal I got on a nice hotel in a large city.  If a view is important, and it should be for anything more than one night, ask for a good one.  The brick wall was dreary. The location is what this place is really all about.  Just blocks from Watertower Mall and other Magnificent Mile shopping. The room was relatively clean, though I did see an errant hair around the shower drain which is a pet peeve of mine.  Decor is updated and stylish.  I wished for a coffee maker in the room but wasn't there long enough to worry about it.  The lounge/bar area is small but effective for late night cocktails. My only serious complaint would be the $48 for overnight valet.  That's a little steep for Chicago but my car was brought up quickly and the valet staff was friendly and professional. Overall, hotel staff was functional, the room was clean, the price was good, and the location was perfect.  I might stay here again though I'm not uninterested in trying another hotel with better views for the price just off Michigan Ave.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1742;4/23/2011;EQ8Pq-KwjOpYGGrgR25MgQ;kUZ128Ym3gDfLrONMPF0tg;I love the Allerton Hotel!  I give it 5 stars not based on luxury hotel standards, but based on the money I spent per night and damn right, it gets five shiny stars. I booked a five night stay via http://expedia.com and got a King Room for a $110 a night...total! That to me seemed extremely reasonable.  The location is more than superb, located between the Apple Store and Brooks Bros. on Michigan Ave.  It's an old boutique hotel that has been updated, modernized yet kept the true charm and details from decades past.   It has character.  The elevators were extremely fast.  Small yes, but fast.  If you want big and lightening speed, I suggest you vacation in Vegas in a new shiny hotel, not an old, boutique hotel in Chicago!  The room was extremely clean as was the lobby and hallways.  Our room was really a good size.  We stayed in  King room, not a King suite, and all seemed perfect.  I had read that rooms were tiny so I was sure not to book a petite standard room.  The bed was comfortable and the room was extremely quite.  The only downside was the lack of counter space in the bathroom, but I figure if two gay men can make it work for five nights, anyone should be able to! I can't speak of the services that the hotel offers as we never used the restaurant, bar or room service.  But the check-in experience, asking of directions, getting a cab were all successes.   For a good looking, perfectly located, reasonably priced hotel......check out the Allerton Hotel........loved it.;5;4;2;2;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1743;8/4/2009;HM87j3aM9EnAluX7MWtqQg;_v1mbSKS5ZpB-LK9H1taIw;The Allerton is an old hotel with a new look. It was redesigned in 2008. A redesign is great for changing the color palette, putting in a hip new chair, and even adding (not free) wifi. That said, walls can't be moved, and floor plans won't change. The short doorways, and single room with more hallway than bedroom are charming to me. I like when old meets new. Free wine from 4-6 is legit, and the location is ideal for just about anything. I wouldn't consider myself a hotel connoisseur, but I really liked this place. The price was right when we booked ($115 for a Friday), but once I'm in the demographic that The Allerton is marketing to I'll be willing to pay the full price. - Free wifi only in the lobby - 24 hour fitness - not the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in, but certainly not bad.;4;0;0;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1744;1/24/2008;oS;7sAkIM47_LE99Hyg5lwdrg;So, I stayed at this hotel for one night and had a couple of beefs with the hotel.  I had a special rate that was being offered, but it was noted that I may have to contact one of the hotel staff to ensure that I could get the rate.  Well, despite 3 phone calls and 3 messages, that hotel staff member NEVER called me back.  Ever.  Thank goodness for decent reservations operators who helped me out eventually.   As for the hotel itself, it's location is fabulous.  It is right on Michigan Ave (entrance slightly off Michigan Ave) - the TIP TOP TAP building!  I will echo others' comments on the closet sized elevator (if I had large luggage, getting in would have been a problem!) and small-ish rooms.  The check-in was efficient and nice, and they gave me and my friend one of the "larger" rooms.  Boy am I glad he did, because even then, it was a bit tiny! Of the room itself.  One major problem which was the floor between the room and bathroom - almost stubbed my foot on a nail (pointy end!) twice - they seriously need to fix that problem as the last thing a hotel guest wants is another tetanus shot on their vacation/trip!  Another smaller problem - the fact that they wanted to charge you for internet access!  Thank goodness we managed to find some "free" wireless from some other buildings nearby.  I personally didn't mind the bed, but my friend thought it was too hard.   Hmmm...  it wasn't all bad!  I loved the shower!  :)   Overall, for the price paid, not bad, especially for the convenience of the location.  But they definitely could fix things, starting with their staff - CALL PEOPLE BACK!!!;3;0;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1745;5/28/2007;a3-B--T9i1r1yK5ENSnlDA;hKKL_uLNwCQ5GzremY8o7w;Ditto on what everyone else said.  Rooms are tiny but nice and modern.  Location is excellent - right on Michigan Ave. near tons of shopping. I wouldn't stay here again though.  I prefer larger rooms.;3;0;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1746;1/18/2011;6Od07MfpxanFC8llyRT46g;bnSC8lnGuozoNayYjJQGzg;Horrible service. I stayed here this weekend and i would have to say one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever experienced. First off we called the hotel 6 times before showing up there to see if we could check in a little early, and they never answered. Then once we got there and let them know that we tried to call, they never apologized but said that our room was ready and we could check in. but not 30 seconds later we were told that we had to wait, and that they would call us when our room was ready. Once we got a call, about an hour later, we went up to the room (the hotel is old and elevators take forever! but its not too bad) which was small, but clean and nice. The room itself was not bad. Since the building is old everything is smaller, from the rooms, to the hallways, to the elevators. The walls are also SUPER thin, you could probably hear your neighbor sneeze if it was a good one. The worst part of our stay was that the hotel NEVER answered the phone. No matter if it was to ask for more towels or to verify the time of the check out. And if that wasn't bad enough, when we checked out they didn't even say 'thank you' or 'hope you enjoyed staying with us'. All we were told when we got down to the front desk was 'you guys already paid, you can go'. If that's not great customer service i don't know what is! I recommend finding another hotel in Chicago to stay at. You can find deals on hotels for about the same price all over the city. So save yourself the trouble.;1;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1747;8/2/2008;OsDwYNSrvjGdZIFI14Wbeg;tUA34mln_F8aHOEUqCtN2w;Don't be swayed by the less-than-modern exterior of the hotel, or the 1920s Tip-Tap sign at the top.  The interior is very modern and comfortable.  Here is my pro/con list: Pro - Large rooms - Sheets that don't move around - Comfortable beds - Decent Internet, although it is tethered - Excellent location - Very nice gym with windows and TVs on each machine Con - Older TVs - Small-ish bathrooms - In-room refridge was just on the ground by itself All in all, Allerton is now my go-to hotel in Chicago.;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1748;8/17/2009;GVWYKwCSZmXvx4coXjJI3w;nfzdme1_TjrCHkQu3wV3lA;It's a classic old brick hotel that's been refurbished into a pleasant boutique lodging for those on a budget.  Given its age the rooms (and hallways, and elevators -- dragging luggage is not always a perfectly smooth operation) are small, but all the room interiors have been comfortably refreshed. The location is great, right on the Mile with excellent views from the higher floors.  Their lounge is modern (but again, small), but a nice quiet spot for a drink.   In the morning, there's complimentary Intelligentsia coffee to start your day. I'd definitely stay there again when business takes me into the second city proper.;3;0;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1749;7/19/2010;j0luZhu-uPp;HD-hlaoxyitGI2z2fvaGJA;I found The Allerton via a web special on http://Hotels.com.  The location at Michigan and Huron (two blocks south of the Water Tower and about five blocks north of the Chicago River) was perfect.  The room was small:it felt like a room full of doors where the front door, closet door, and bathroom door all came together in a tangled mess.  Otherwise, the room was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was quite comfortable. Boo!  Hiss!  For charging a minimum of $9.95 per day for in-room internet service (even more dough for faster speeds).  You can get free Wi-Fi in the Second Floor lounge if you would prefer to surf in public. I was on the 9th floor with a western view of Michigan Avenue, so there was nothing to shout about there.  My friend was on a higher floor on a corner and enjoyed her combo view west and north. Room service was always prompt and courteous.  Skip the bar on the Second Floor.  It is dead, dead, dead.  But, if you want to grab a bite to take back to your room, the $5 sliders and $5 quesadilla are a good value. The gym on the 25th floor was well stocked with all the equipment one would expect, and was never busy. There is free coffee on the Second Floor each morning, and you can also use a computer kiosk there to check in for your flight home.;3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1750;7/22/2011;g7ND3ilkFkX1AxBqcu6HbA;atNPQPnWjmP8lGSc6M9KzQ;Pro: Cleanliness. Location.  This one probably makes up for all the cons below. Online deals seemed available. Con: Told I would have a room with a view.  The view was of the a/c unit that blocked all but an inch of the window. Staff not that helpful if you're not in the "trendy" crowd. Airlines use this hotel for their staff, and if you're there when they are coming or going, good luck trying to get an elevator, a cab, service from the bellhop, etc. The elevators can fit maybe 1 person with luggage and 1 other person.  They are extremely small and there are few of them so it takes awhile to get to your room.  I waited 6 minutes for an elevator, which doesn't seem like much.  But after a day of touring the city, tired feet, being hungry, etc., 6 minutes is 6 minutes too long to be waiting for an elevator.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1751;11/13/2011;nBfkFj6dO-qQk996A3JSEw;tICvWNWLbXhGsFJ32tgS7Q;The Allerton Hotel was the site for our Civil Union in September. We were the destination wedding and they handled the entire event, ceremony, cocktails, dinner and Sunday brunch.  Julia Chovanec the catering manager was great, professional, warm, friendly and flexible. She spent quality time guiding us through the whole process. The hotel staff was also great and so helpful.  The catering menu was amazing as well as the wedding cake made by Bombon.  The Allerton with its Tip Top Tap ballroom was the perfect place host a downtown wedding celebration, we couldn't have been happier.;5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1752;4/4/2011;DOElOsiQDISPVjpVXggsJA;TC6D6GEWt_A70SOt9SVGIA;I think this could easily be a great hotel, there's one thing keeping it from that... Elevators. If I were an elevator company, I'd be sending them proposals to upgrade their systems.;4;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1753;8/6/2010;BcvMCmhWBxba7OqVtFV2TQ;iZfPxKDl6HuKzulg2U8fXw;Man oh man.  Where do I start? First of all, I had pre-paid in FULL for a king room.  When we checked in, we were placed in a tiny queen.  I'd understand the change in reservation given the circumstance that I had only placed a reservation to be paid at check-out.  However, if I pay for something in full ahead of time, I expect that reservation to be honored as promised.  The room we were placed in was in front of the service elevator, and there were meaty spiders inside the room all along the window sill (windows were closed, by the way).  At this point I was annoyed.  I called front desk and the agent I spoke to apologized and promised to move us into an available suite for the remainder of our stay the next morning and would also send us breakfast on the house.  He told us to just come down in the morning after we eat and that everything would be taken care of without any extra trouble or cost.  My boyfriend and I figured that we could tolerate our tiny closet full of spiders for a night. We went to bed, figuring that all was well and that things would be rectified in the morning. Wrong. So I go down the next morning, and the agent who "helped" me, Kevin, was a total douchenozzle.  I kindly explained what had happened the night prior and he said he couldn't place me in a new room, sneering as he said "I don't know what you're talking about."  Mind you, he spoke before even looking up my guest information and checking notes that had been left by the agent previously.  I told him that if there was a problem, I would not mind speaking to his manager.  At which point he snapped "I AM the manager."  He then pulled my information up on the screen and said,"Ohhhh I see" and rolled his eyes at me. Long story short: after more sneering ensued and talking to me like I was stupid, Kevin rudely sent me away and told me to come back "whenever" instead of giving us an estimated time when our room would be ready.  THEN he called our room and curtly demanded that we pack our stuff and it would be stowed in storage because he needed our current room NOW.  It was 11 AM and check out was not until noon.  Check in isn't even until 3.  First of all, our reservation was goofed.  Then our alternate room wasn't ready.  And now you're rushing us out of our current room with no where else to go?  Nice. By the time the bellhop arrived at our door, I had decided that I no longer wanted to stay at the hotel and wanted my money back.  I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman helping us, Carlos, if there was another manager I could speak to besides Kevin since the service was terrible.  Carlos then said,"Hmmm...I'm the front desk manager.  I oversee him."  Interesting.  I ultimately got my money back and will never return to this hotel.  There's a right way and a wrong way to rectify mistakes.  Had Kevin been apologetic, truthful, and courteous from the get-go, there would have been no problem.  I work in customer service also and I understand that mistakes happen.  However, I did not pay good money to be given sub-par service and a terrible attitude when I can get treated like sh*t for free on the street.  I left a voicemail for the general manager, who was not in office that day.  The director of operations did follow up with me, and I appreciated his efforts in earnest.  He apologized, stated that the service given by Kevin was not the kind of service the Allerton strives to provide, and offered to take care of any future accomodations the next time I plan on being in town.  I kindly declined, stating that my experience was colored in a really negative way.  Unfortunately, a bad apple did spoil the bunch and I would rather spend my money elsewhere.   Not to mention that you can find a much nicer, roomier hotel with much more pleasant staff in the city for less money.   Do not stay at the Allerton unless you WANT to have a bad night.;1;3;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1754;1/1/2012;4hzfn8sqewHfFluzQCKqKA;ifZJeZuTTj4dfEoR29I6bA;I loved this hotel...when my niece and I walked in we didn't feel worthy enough to be here. We thought we would get kicked out and be told the Super 8 was down the street. It was super classy, chic, and sophisticated. From the door man, to the concierge, to the bellhop, to the desk clerk, everyone was super professional. The room was fantastic, the bedding awesome, the flat screen with cable, even better. I ended up getting a Groupon for some reason and received 4 glasses of complimentary wine at the hotel bar. That place was great. They serve you a little bowl of snack nut mixture while your laying on the couch watching all the guests walk by. Now the downers, renting movies at night $15 per movie (and not the dirty ones), wi-fi, you had to pay a fee per day. I think it was like $8, the room service cappuccinos, 2 for $16, uh hem...and the fee to park your car $50 per day, holy sh*t I say! But other than that I loved it. It was right on Michigan Ave and an easy walk to everything..yes I would come back :);4;0;0;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1755;12/8/2008;FQiM9BicnP1iRvloZWrJQg;JcTKCoGbVHzFVyyDXpKa_Q;Cute! Cute! Cute! This is such a cute, stylin' boutique, chic hotel. The workers here were very polite to me and always opened the door for me when entering in and out of the building. My room was just a tad bit small, but no need to complain because my huge, King size bed made up for it. It was so comfortable. I also enjoyed the free hot chocolate that they would serve in the mornings and evenings at the lobby. Seeing the marshmallows and chocolate bits melt into my hot chocolate made me giddy. Hehe. :) Another great plus, is the LOCATION. Right on Magnificent Mile where all the good shopping and good food take place. :) I think the only complaint I have are the tiny and slow elevators that don't even have sensors. They only stay open for a few seconds, then afterwards, it'll just smoosh you as you're getting in. Although, I WAS in the elevator with Michael Phelps. So that was cool. I swear, that was him. I would definitely stay here again when I'm  in Chicago.;4;1;1;1;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1756;3/12/2011;NtsCfXlTm1r9aXl;eSoJmU-ESE7waziz1IKjsQ;Let me start off by saying that I did not stay here, this review is only for the experience I had with booking my wedding room block here. So of course Hotwire was running some deal, where you could get a fight and a room at the Allerton for some really ridiculously low rate. So rather than booking directly through the Hotel, my out of town relatives booked through Hotwire. Knowing this, I called my contact at the hotel who will be called "MK" in this review and added everyone to the list. I spent a significant amount of time on the phone with MK so that everyone that was checking in would get the out of town bag etc. So when check in date came along, I was told by my mother-in-law that no one was getting bags!!! As you can imagine this is the LAST thing I wanted to deal with after having spent HOURS on the phone with MK and being charged $3 bucks a bag so they could sit there and not be distributed. I had to call the hotel after my rehearsal to iron out the issues. It appears that MK left no list at the check in counter and no one knew what to do, even though I had dropped off 20 bags to be given out. The best part is that I was still charged for "distribution" after having gone through this pain in rear experience. MK was less that pleasant to deal with, so please be cautious if you are ever considering a room block here. Be prepared to make phone calls and supervise the night before your wedding. NEVER AGAIN!!!;1;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1757;8/12/2005;8IY0A3sOqSMpHXKDZRu6Ig;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;The Crowne Plaza did a nice job of renovating the old Allerton. The exterior is sharp with its masonry walls complemented by a newer glass awning over the main entrance. Only so much could be done with the old rooms. While they are pleasant enough, they are small by modern standards. The location is primo, right along Michigan Avenue where all the tourists want to be.;4;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1758;7/24/2011;rUlgqZH4TueQIocZfi6Ehg;b1BqeZPksx7rUi6StZTJTw;From the outside this hotel looks out of place compared to the newer buildings on magnificent mile but the decor inside was well done and the staff was really nice for the most part. The rooms are pretty small but I booked the hotel for a really good rate compared to other hotels on michigan ave so it wasn't one of my biggest complaints. My biggest complaint was the damn elevator!  I think that this hotel has the worst elevator in all of Chicago, I was only on the 7th floor and it still took forever for the  elevator to reach the floor. Although there was a computer room with free color printing, I would have loved to have wifi in the room as well. The bathroom was tiny and reminded me of those small bathrooms they have in most hotels in europe, with no bathtub and a really small corner  shower. The gym was nice and had super clean equipment and free weights. It was always quite and had a great view of the city. What was great about the Allerton was the location, it was easy to get around and was close to most major attractions.;3;1;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1759;1/8/2011;VcnnesgTRshI8sk4Jk1wiA;ByaQRkbLr7HD-R0vHiLSMQ;Held our wedding here in November 2010 and could not have been happier.  Our coordinator, Julia, went above and beyond to make sure that everything went as perfectly as planned.  Fernando was fantastic too at making sure everything went smoothly.  Yes, the standard rooms are small so be prepared, but the suites are really nice.   The ballroom on the 23rd floor (Tip Top Tap) is fantastic.  Incredible view of Michigan Ave., which was perfect for all our out of town guests.  We had about 120 people, which was just about a perfect size.  The food was great as well.  We had so many compliments on the whole evening from all of our guests.  I would not have done anything differently.;5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1760;9/21/2005;nDkK;ElVVa0LmnbBCXhNh-l34-Q;I stayed here for a graduate school interview and was pleasantly surprised.  The place doesn't look so hot from far away (see pic), and the lobby on the first floor is tiny and dark.  But once you go up the elevator to the real lobby, things are much better.  It's really annoying that you have to change elevators to go up and down, but the location of this hotel is excellent.;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

This hotel was so cute and really made my first time in Chicago. It was clean, modern yet vintage, and the service was excellent.

1763;5/28/2008;40M7hJPLkmr9qDQuJ-3W-w;VqAZK9q8ybyiZMdQI8Ce8A;I have to start off by saying this hotel made me want to extend my stay in Chicago.  The room rate was pretty comparable to other hotels in the area.  They also have special web rates if you book directly with them.  Parking is $51 a day with in and out privileges.  The bellmen were great and helpful.  The gentlemen at the front desk were extremely polite and helpful.  He even asked if we wanted an upgrade to a 2 bed room which my cousin and i turned down at first not knowing how small Chicago rooms were.  The 1 bed room was pretty and all but my cousin and i needed a little more space considering that we were going to go shopping.  We called front desk to see if it would be a hassle to change rooms and it wasn't a problem.  The  2 bed room was much roomier.  I would recommend the 1 bed for a couple.  The cocktails were excellent and the lounge/ restaurant.  Also , the location is in perfect walking distance from everything (landmarks, shops, eateries).;5;0;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1764;10/20/2008;d8vsDk0fxJQbC7T4EIBf3A;R-3CWGx45DEZKiGLiQDl7g;I can not recommend this hotel for business travel.  We paid a great deal of money for my tiny room and then when I had no Internet connection as promised.  When I enquired, I was told to the room had never been connected to the hotel's Internet and that I was simply out of luck. I wrote a complaint email to the general manger about the situation and was ignored.  In a city with great business-class hotels, why would I return to one that can't deal with such a simple (but important need) and who treats its clients disrespectfully?;2;0;1;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
1765;6/24/2009;pgW60;fm3Qw9Xe2QFfUiloIWwygg;though i consider myself to be a modern bride, i did still want to tie in some historic chicago to my wedding day. i ended up choosing to have my wedding at this hotel because it has a very cool vintage regal feel to it while it is still updated with everything you need. our reception was in the renaissance ballroom. i wanted to have breathtaking views for our OOT guests to enjoy. they had an onsite planner to help with everything and it was a big help throughout the entire process. they even had experience with other asian weddings and were able to help us with menu choices that would satisfy both our eastern and western guests.;5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

1767;9/19/2012;v3PFsvHJIsQ1yPGiwzDKBA;cydkiUKwlr3B2CaFRDeRfg;Checked into this hotel after staying at Hotel Indigo for a few days.. I enjoyed my stay! Started off a little rough, I checked in at noon and of course no rooms were available and they just told me to "check back later". I left my bags, had lunch, and toured the city. Came back at 5 pm only to be told that a room was still not ready... After looking at the lady w/ a crazy "You can't be serious" face... she says "But... we can upgrade you". That turned my frown upside down :)   I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite w/ King bed. I walked in and thought "All this for me? "  LOVED the room. Bed was comfy, plenty of space. I was on the 25th floor so I didnt hear the ambulance sirens that i read about in other reviews. The furniture/decor isn't great but everything was clean. Granite in the bathroom. Aveda products. The location was absolutely perfect! Right in the heart of the mile. I was able to walk everywhere. I was also able to walk a block over to Michigan/Erie (or) Huron/Fairbanks and catch buses to South Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, and beyond.. As a female walking alone, i felt completely safe walking the area at night/early morning. I also enjoyed visiting the Starbucks down the street. Its located inside the hospital and its 24 hours! Several food choices on Erie/Ontario/Superior. Grocery store on Fairbanks. Garrett's popcorn on Ontario... all of these places are walking distance. The service was also spectacular! Everyone I encountered went above and beyond to assist me. Sunday morning, I went up to the rooftop pool to watch the sunrise over Lake Michigan...it was awesome! My only suggestion...I know its on the 50th floor but... those windows could use some scrubbing.. I didnt use w-fi, gym, or the pool.. I was too busy sightseeing. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.;5;1;1;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

1771;8/28/2011;SxH;Rd__6ZGCWea1o8Yku7ZsaA;I wouldn't say this is a 4 star hotel:but for the price, it is definitely worth 4 out of 5 stars. The best thing about this hotel, is the location--so many places within walking distance!  It's located a block away from the (in)famous Magnificent Mile shops, close to tons of restaurants, near the Gold Coast and close to the "L" red line...which helps make even further away neighborhoods easily accessible. The rooms are average but clean, modern and very spacious.  The bathrooms, however, could use some updating.  The door seems to be a tad too big for the doorway (weird, I know), so closing and opening it was a bit of a struggle.  However, I was satisfied with the bath products (Neutrogena). As for the free wireless internet--I'd say it is a plus and at the same time a thumbs down.  Free is always a good thing...but it was insanely slow (I'm assuming bc everyone is using it). Overall, this place is an excellent bang for the buck.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here, again.;4;1;1;2;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

The Fridges have some bizzare borg-inspired technology that "senses" if you take something out of the fridge (ie. to put your own drinks in) and charges you accordingly. 3. The Elevators - Slowest Elevators in the WORLD. We waiting 30 mins to get one on a Sunday AM on the 20th Floor. Yes, Really. Aside from that - It's pretty OK.

1774;2/19/2011;0-At22WS;1iJ4HoDOGSeIdyZQG6Qzww;The location of this hotel is excellent.  It is one block from N Michigan Avenue and around the corner from one of the best pizza restaurants in the country.  You cannot do much better in the city of Chicago.  The only negative (and it is a small one) is that it is close to Northwestern Hospital, so there are a lot of sirens in the area.   The staff of the hotel was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The doorman quickly hailed a cab for us, walking down to the corner to do so.   The room was clean and bright.  Wi-fi worked good.  The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels. I had a corner suite and I found that the room was rather drafty (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  I had to turn the heat up higher than I normally like to in order to compensate for the draft.;4;1;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
1775;4/15/2009;fhxFMr3gDYUlioFgn4O1-g;c9PwtsNozIxJ5NDMT5C9qQ;This place is a steal compared to the other swanky hotels off of Michigan Avenue. Yeah if you're used to staying at 4 star hotels and above this might seem like a 3 star hotel to you but it is really a deal for the location. And apparently it used to be the Radisson, but it's better than any Radisson I've seen! We stayed for 4 nights in a 1 bedroom suite with views of Lake Michigan and I only paid about $530, averaging out to about $130/night. But that's with a one room service meal and the ridiculous state tax of 11.9% + city tax 3.5% each night added on. What a deal for such a prime location! Hotel Service: Service by the concierge and front desk was pleasant and helpful. Room service was friendly but they didn't get my order right, but it was partially my fault for trying to order breakfast food at 9pm! They accomodated a late check-out at 2pm. :) Hotel Condition: Newly renovated. Halls are still a little outdated and the lobby could use some more decor, but the rooms have been furnished and decorated well. The pool wasn't open but apparently it's only open from May-Sept. Room cleanliness: Overall, pretty clean but there were some fingerprints and dust on the tables. Room comfort: Since it was a 1-bedroom suite we had ample space but the bathroom was small. The shower head was a rain shower and the pressure was very weak. However, the bed is more important and it was very comfortable. It got pretty cold because the bedroom is surrounded by windows, so we had to keep the heater running, which was pretty loud. It also helped to keep the drapes closed, but that view was so fantastic! There was a large LCD TV in each room, an iPod docking station in the parlor and the best part, an iMac computer with free wireless! I didn't even have to bring my laptop. A mini fridge is only $20 for your entire stay. I would recommend walking over to Wal-greens and buying some drinks instead of using the minibar.;4;5;2;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
1776;5/27/2009;ZxgiFoyvLEQHlopT;aDlwg8N82TY66pSo1eFhkA;Let me first say that I'm used to staying at mosquito infested dumps on the Mekong delta, and hostels filled with drunk Canadians crashing in at 4 in the morning... so I may be a bit unqualified to rate a place as nice as the Avenue, but I'll be damned if I don't try. As far as bang for your buck goes, I was blown away by this hotel. The staff was friendly, and the rooms were relatively cheap, but still enormous. The standard king sized room that I stayed in had a couch, and a work desk on top of other standards like lounge chairs and TVs. There was a rooftop bar and pool that were a great way to end a relaxing day exploring Chicago. Even for someone used to traveling on a budget, the Avenue doesn't come close to breaking the bank. This place is a great deal, and you get a heck of a lot for your hard earned dough.;5;1;2;2;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
1777;4/30/2010;mGaaKd1Zfr4sUEEPdJd5Rw;2L-23vsdN1VWlyI58xwaPQ;After reading the other glowing reviews, I think I might be at a different hotel. This place has pretentious written all over it. It aspires, and yet, it fails. I've yet to see a "large" or "spacious room." I was in a Comfort Suites near O'Hare yesterday, and today, the room I'm in at the Avenue (which costs much more) is smaller than most hotel rooms I stay at in 4-to-5-star hotels. My room overlooks the roof of another building. My flat panel TV gets 16 channels, most of which are local/network. Valet parking is either $45 or $49, more than the cost of renting the car for the day. I couldn't get an answer because there was utter chaos at check in. No organization at all. My room wasn't ready when it was supposed to be. I had to wait 45 (!) minutes for a room to become available, so I just surfed the Internet on my laptop while I waited. Did I get anything in compensation? Nope. Even more confusing? My reservation calls this place the Crowne Plaza. Everything else calls it the "Avenue." The sign outside says both. Which is it? Not impressed -- and I'm even a Priority Club member. P.S. The "zebra chairs" are just a cotton print. You could make one with fabric from Wal-Mart.;2;1;1;2;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
1778;3/18/2009;WlEzuQU7UR--NQ;5ZLmqYMShycauR7FAWts-A;You can definitely tell the Avenue was renovated.  The elevators, ceilings, walls, and general structure looked pretty old... but whoever manages the property tries really hard to keep the decor modern enough to hide the building's age.   Our room was a suite and had very trendy decor and furnishings.  It even came complete with two matching zebra-printed robes.  The bedroom was large and had a comfortable king bed, a great view of downtown Chicago, and a flat panel TV.  The living room area had a pull out couch, a flat panel TV, an i-home deck, and a bar area.  The staff was always quick to bring towels, bring wine glasses, or assist with luggage as needed.  I also enjoyed the fact that it was a quick walk or taxi ride to the nearest malls, Walgreens, or bars. The only negative thing I could really think of was that the fitness center was pretty weak.  There were like 3 treadmills and 1 didn't work.  They only had a couple other pieces of equipment in there.  It was really bare.   If I ever felt like dealing with the snow and wind of Chi-town again, I wouldn't mind at all booking a room at the Avenue Hotel.;4;1;1;1;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
1779;1/2/2009;kqTPJw;l98PQE-v7vvRlrOIMc4TlA;4 stars for the cost and location.  Check out expedia and you can get a room for right under $100 a night.  Considering it is about 1/2 block off of Michigan Ave the price is right if thats the area you want to stay in.   Room itself is decent sized, looks just like the pictures and the bed was comfy but nothing amazing.  The bar on the top floor is way overpriced and has a horrible atmosphere.  However, there is a pub connected to the hotel on the bottom floor.  Great food, good drink and a great atmosphere.  Check it out.;4;1;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
1780;1/4/2010;81MCF7B;E-kn5M1EYR0oePJcxleU6A;GREAT location, but you can definitely find better quality. It's been "renovated" but it's like that barely renovated look. (Fresh bed linens but wallpaper curling at the floor type of renovation!) The bathrooms were nice but my door would not stay shut unless slammed.  The rooms had VERY thin walls....do what you want with that information.   The customer service was decent, nothing crazy. The pricing was on point, I went through priceline and paid 159 for New Year's Eve. I wish I would have gone for another option, to be honest. One thing did stick out to me: my husband and I waited (LITERALLY) fifteen minutes for an elevator down. Not cool when your hungry and are wearing 5 inch heels. Overall, great for a weekend trip on a budget when you'll be staying little to no time in your hotel bad for a romantic splurge.;2;0;1;1;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

The hotel has a rooftop pool on the 40th floor with spectacular views of the city. The pool was not all that impressive but the view made up for it. There is even a bar in the hotel that had Trivia Night on Tuesdays. We didn't make it to Trivia but the idea is always fun!

We got this place at an incredible price on Hotwire.  Then they wanted to charge extra if we requested double beds... (who does that by the way).. and so we upgraded to a double bed and got a suite.   A suite means you get a couch and some extra space.  Totally dissapointed. I thought it meant you get a separate room... right? The valet is okay.. takes about 10-15 minutes to get your car out unless you really call ahead of time.

1788;8/5/2011;K4wipsCOm1pbsxVgxunbXg;ig2Zy7gjuG2pVQxHn_Q9Ag;We chose this hotel based on Yelp. Highly recommend this hotel.  All employees were very customer focused.  Emily checked us in and since we were early they stored our luggage until our room was ready. We asked Emily to give us a city view as high up as possible.  At first she had us on the 32nd floor and when we returned to check in she had booked us on the 39th floor which is the highest floor with rooms. The pool and breakfast lounge is on the 40th floor which is top floor.  The view from room 3909 is fanastic.  This room is a king suite which has a leather couch witha pull out bed which is where our two kids slept.  The mattress was awesome and so comfortable.  Nice flat screen TV, closet space, and did I mention the excellent view. The waterfall shower head was nice but water pressure was not the best either because of the age of the plumbing or it was equipped with a water reducer or both.  It was fine for me, but the wife wished it would have had more pressure.  Not a deal breaker though. We would definitely stay here again.  Very close and centrally located to about everything we wanted to do. The roof top pool was awesome.  The views from there are excellent as well.  Since it was 90+ degrees it was busy during the day but in the evening it was manageable.  The first night which was a Sunday we had the pool to ourselves for awhile which was nice.  I thought the $250 per night average including taxes was very reasonable for all things considered.  Free wi-fi and they did not charge a seperate fee for the pool which alot of places do.  They have parking on site for $50/day but we took the train.  Cab ride to the train station is about $15.00 including tip. Navy Pier, Chinatown, and Willis Tower is all $15.00 or less each way too.  All the shopping, Hancock, and tons of excellent restaurants can easily be reached by foot.  This will be the only hotel we stay at for future visits to Chicago.  Highly recommend the Avenue Crowne!;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

The room is smaller than most banquet halls, I think it could hold upto 200 people. The wedding we attended transformed the room from a ceremony setup to a sit down dinner with DJ booth, center dance floor and dinner tables on each side of the room.

1790;8/24/2012;tY3jXK6weTmHvcEsOL6FBw;r5ZnZ3vQC0jLFVRy3fvZEg;The Drake is a beautiful hotel.  But, I feel like for the type of hotel it is, the service should be better.   My husband and I stayed here in the middle of our honeymoon.  We were on an "adventure" honeymoon and had been camping through all the national parks in the West before coming to Chicago--and of course splurging on a nice hotel because it was our honeymoon!  Is it because I rolled up in my dirty honda civic that was extremely full and had bikes on the back that made them think that they didn't need to be helpful?  Someone did take my suitcases, but then afterwards didn't really help me out.  Since he seemed to disappear, I ended up just taking them myself because he just left them on the corner of the sidewalk.   The concierge and the front desk were very nice and helpful about what to do in the area, although we couldn't get any kind of upgrades (like so many I hear about) for being on our honeymoon.  I didn't necessarily expect that, but was hoping.  The view from our room was beautiful still--view of Lake Michigan.  The bed was super amazing and comfy.   When we were leaving and the valet brought my car around, I talked to the guy driving it and tipped him.  Got in the car and saw that a plant I had brought with me was completely tipped over.  There was soil all over the passenger side floor and the plant was uprooted.  I know, it's weird to bring a house plant on a trip with you.  But the fact is that it was there and it was totally a mess....  The driver could have at least told me when I was talking with him.... did he not notice the soil everywhere??  To be fair, there happened to be one guy that noticed I was upset about it.  He took my floor mat, shook it out, and helped me get everything back together.  He was SUPER nice.  I wish I knew his name, because he seemed to be the only one that cared.   I know my complaints seem picky, but the fact is we don't splurge on expensive hotels that often, so I was expecting a bit more.  No one really seemed to go out of their way. (on our wedding night we stayed at the Boston Harbor Hotel which DID go above and beyond)  The hotel was gorgeous and comfortable, but the service wasn't really what I was expecting.  Maybe when I'm older and better dressed?;3;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

An iconic hotel in every way, from the architecture to the decor - you find yourself ensconced in old Chicago style. The Drake wears its age well, and everything is immaculate and updated without being modern or boutique-like, which would ruin the historic vibe. We stayed in a Deluxe King, with fantastic views of Lake Michigan and the Gold Coast. The room was large, with plenty of space for two to sit and relax. The bed was comfy and the duvet was up to par with more modern hotels. The location couldn't be better, just off Michigan Ave. The common areas in the hotel are spectacular, from the chandeliers, lounges, lobby, and even the hallways are warm and rich with history. We'd absolutely stay at The Drake again. NB: valet parking is a steep $55 a night.;5;2;1;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

Ever since I moved to Chicago, I'd been wanting to know what it was like. So, I decided to surprise my husband with a little down-time at the Drake. How fun! I thought I just booked a room but this was definitely a suite. There was a large sitting space, if I recall a fireplace, an incredible view of the lake and the drive. Also, I wish my bathroom looked as spacious as this one. When we walked into the suite, there was jazz playing. Peel Me a Grape. Need I say more. The little bar on the ground floor was cozy, though we only stayed long enough to get a bottle of wine to take back to the room. The elevator had old wood interior and must have been a refurbished original. So glad whoever was in charge of restoring this hotel did. What a great piece of architectural history and a great exception if staycations seem not high on your list.;5;2;2;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

It almost seems tacky to say but somehow Hotwire got me and my S.O. a very affordable room over my birthday last year  (January 1st - no small feat!). Again, NO idea how this happened. I hadn't heard of The Drake and had no idea what to expect. My jaw dropped open upon arrival. Deliciously elegant with what I guess you could call old-world charm. That's not to say the fixtures and the beds and the HVAC aren't top notch and newly furnished. Great views, wonderful service, comfortable and functional everything. Now the Drake has become my gold standard. BAD IDEA. This means any other hotel has become a comparable flea-bag motel, no matter what the star rating, price, or how nice a view of a city I get. I open the door and... disappointment. Where's the perfection of the Drake (the roomy interior, handsome desk, huge bathroom, the tasteful color scheme, the fantastic location...)? Phenomenal. Classy. Retreat and romance material all the way. Still thinking and dreaming about it a year later.;5;2;1;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

But we started bad and it went downhill from there. The building was having some renovations so there was some scaffolding in the entrance which sort of took away from the experience of "arriving at the Drake." We were greeted with half smiles by the reception. Room on the first floor, city view. I had not done enough research to know to request a lake view, so I kept my mouth shut. We entered our room which was spacious, with a king bed and couch. Bathroom with tub, but on the smaller side. About 10pm, some construction or maintenance along Michigan Avenue started. It was a loud drone of machinery, the kind where you feel incredible relief upon its cessation. But it didn't cease. Not past midnight. Not past 1am. We finally called the front to see what could be done, the best they offered were these cheap earplugs. And the bed was too soft for my comfort, I woke up every couple hours to pain in my back. I know it wasn't the hotel's fault, but having paid $360 for ONE night, i really expected more than first floor, street noise, spongy earplugs, and back pain. It's a beautiful hotel, but I will never again stay here.;1;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

1800;7/17/2011;WiSke5gjtmC3FuEZJ-4uOw;F85UxlQM6YzVxSuddW8BQw;The lesson from such old hotels is that - sitting on your laurels results in butt rash. The location is wonderfully convenient.  The rooms? Tiny as hell and the walls that separate them are thin as can be. I was treated to a rather spectacular fight from a somewhere-in-the-vicinity room at 2 am. There's nothing special about the rooms.  The bedding is just "meh".  On the 9th floor, the air conditioning never seems to be correct  It was colder in the room than it was in the refrigerator. Speaking of odd things, there's no dresser space.  Where am I supposed to store my man panties?  There's a closet, but honestly - I'm not going to hang my Andrew Christians up.  Drawer space!  Whatever space there might have been under the giant TV was taken up with the minibar offerings. The bathroom was very nice and had a tub, which I prefer over a standing shower - as long as it's clean.  The Drake does housekeeping very well.  Excellent soaps, shampoo, conditioner & body creams as well. As pointed out by Omar, there's no wifi in the rooms. So, be prepared to shell out $12.95 a day for internet access that requires an ethernet jack or bring your own internet access stick. The food, though, was quite good and I have to give the Drake a lot of praise for doing gluten free very well.   I can take a so-so room.  I can't take terrible food.  This was pretty darned good, and I was the envy of my colleagues all week, as my employer arranged for special meals at breakfast and lunch. If you have mobility issues, this could be a rough patch if you're using the meeting space.  Lots of stairs.  Frankly, I loved the stairs.  It was the only exercise I got - and I did lust for the very nice gym which features Precor equipment across multiple rooms.   The front desk staff is superb and the security is very good.  I got the fish eye once or twice as I meandered back from Jamba Juice.  Perhaps it was the tight jeans and t-shirt?  I just didn't dress the part of a Drake guest, perhaps. The hotel itself is extraordinarily convenient to shopping.  Gucci is across the street, and that's just the start of the permanent damage you can do to your credit rating.   Rush Street is about a 5 minute walk away.;3;7;3;6;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1801;4/3/2012;QqEDNdTE3gZgx16qEDC8dQ;OkbLy8Pl2K17hro8G4Pz5g;A wonderful hotel, very classy, very charming, very much out of my price range, but along came Priceline and this is where we ended up on our first trip to Chicago. I always prefer the more mid range hotels because they have a few little things included like breakfast, wi-fi, etc. I know that if i stay at a higher end place these things are gonna cost, and it always makes me a bit grumpy. We ended up not eating a bit of food in the hotel because it was just so far out of our price range, and the free wifi in the lobby was in hot demand (not only by us). Our room wasn't all that tiny, I was expecting much worse, but it was a typical big city hotel room. I was very thankful for clean towels that didn't stink like bleach and for a decent room darkening shade so that I could actually sleep in a bit. We stayed 2 nights and even though our coffee cups were replaced the coffee and tea was not replenished. Not that big of a deal since we got coffee at breakfast outside of the hotel, but I do enjoy a cup when I am getting ready. Located at the very top of the Magnificent Mile, we were actually very thankful to be there because it forced us to do a lot of walking, which we definitely needed after eating tons of great food. This is the ideal hotel if you are visiting Chicago and going to the American Girl store, tons of girls with creepy dolls everywhere, and I imagine we'll be back very soon with my daughter. I would give 5 stars, but the lack of any breakfast option included and in room wi-fi being included is a star to me.;4;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1802;12/26/2011;TJW6EaQjSijnYsih4fzomw;wtmsL5qvx7zcam5G9BDvxg;This review is specifically for The Palm Court at the Drake Hotel.  The cherubs around the fountain, the live entertainment and elegant "Powder Room" are just a few examples of how a classic, elegant old hotel continues its historic heritage. It seems that the Saturday night I was there is the ballroom/social dancing night.  It was wonderful to see the women in their pretty floral dresses and heels, while the men were decked in their jackets. One gentleman brought his dancing shoes in a separate bag, changed from brown and black deck shoes into glossy black dress shoes.  In an instant, he was up and out on the dance floor with a woman - where she came from, I haven't a clue - and was gliding his way around the floor.   It is a civilized evening.  The songstress croons soulfully and the band plays silky, sensual music.  Those who happen to stumble on this event are largely unaware of what is taking place and try to blend in with the regulars.  They take a few brave chances with their dance steps, but soon realize they are neophytes. Perhaps this venue was one of the predecessors to the "So You Think You Can Dance" idea!  The dancing moves were amazing! And the "Powder Room!"  Unlike anything I've ever seen.  I'm a 50-something from Hawaii and have traveled around the world, but I've not been in a magnificent, elegant ladies room such as this.  The sign above the doorway actually says "Powder Room" - not "Women" or "Ladies" or anything else. Each stall is exquisitely decorated and there are even plush velveteen footstools to sit on.  There is even a sink in each stall.  Large handtowels and tissues are generously provided. I love having an after-dinner drink here.  I enjoy people-watching and also use the tie to reflect on my day spent in Chicago.;4;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1803;6/10/2012;TC-2xv7R;j7hqs84ZWB4gjJTsAvBmVg;The High Tea at the Drake is an amazing experience. We loved our time spent here. We enjoyed a three tiered lunch with a variety of amazing culinary delights. The egg salad has a mango chutney in it, it was so yummy! The pastries and desserts were also amazing. Each table received home made strawberry jam, lemon curd, and cream, and all three tasted amazing on the pastries. The scones and banana bread were made fresh in house, everything was made fresh, and all of it was delicious. I ordered the Bombay Chai to drink and it was literally the best cup of tea I have ever had. For thirty six dollars per person, this is a treat, however, it was worth every penny, the service was amazing, and I loved the experience. There was a harpist who performed during the entire tea service and the fountain and flowers were beautiful. On our way out we stopped at the Ladies Powder Room, each bathroom stall had its own sink and seat to freshen up one's makeup, what a luxury!

But, I've been fortunate enough to have been the guest at some cool soirees at this fancy pants hotel and I'm quite impressed with the way they run shop. To begin with, no matter which side of the hotel in which you enter, you know you're in for a treat. Ample staff, click-clacky floors, lots of gilded stuff and mirrors that allow me to ogle myself and say, "D@mn, I'm looking good tonight!"... these are all pluses. From the check-in staff to doormen to waitstaff, I've never had anyone be less than helpful. I don't know if folks are, genuinely happy to work here or fantastic actors but, as a guest, I appreciate the charm and hospitality. It goes noticed. The ballrooms are exactly what you'd imagine a ballroom in an old, majestic hotel to be: opulent, historic, mysterious, and achingly romantic. I think my favorite thing about the ballrooms are the views. The windows are floor-to-ceiling and they look out at some of the most incredible views of Lake Michigan that you'll ever see. A nighttime view -- in the winter -- at the crashing waves, foamy crests and pitch waters can put a spell on you if you let it. Let it. After your betwitching is over, look up. Gaze high at the ceiling and then let you view go long. The rooms are so much higher and deeper than what they initially appear to be. Yet, despite the depth, acoustics are never a problem. I don't know whether this is a modern sound-engineering miracle or structural engineering foresight from long ago but whatever the reason, again, it's appreciated and noticed. Getting a chance to dress up in fancy clothes and attend fancy black-tie affairs is fun (for me). Getting the chance to do so in a historical, mouth-dropping venue like The Drake is an incredibly opportunity you should take, if offered. While things, in general, seem to go towards new! younger! hipper!... there's a reason why classics are classics... and why classics are classy. Be classy.;4;13;14;9;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1805;4/17/2012;uXsv6dYV2SW9TWMNL3Egsg;3786zBeN0bNPFUa_M2ldVw;i spent two days with my girlfriend, last week end. The location is perfect and there's a great view of the lake. The hotel is gorgeous, the staff very helpful especially at the concierge. The amazing part is the bar downstairs, pretty cool. We spent a pleasant night on the dance floor with live entertainment. A must to do, if you go during the week end, it's so much fun and relax at the same time.;5;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1806;5/31/2011;dHdU2ZPrO7YcoT9tCt0OjA;tSsrI0UKvfMfur7Kbww0-w;I was a little weary of staying at The Drake Hotel after reading the reviews here on yelp, and seeing how they tended to be all over the map. I was pleasantly surprised though! The Drake is charming hotel, with a very helpful and courteous staff. It is very centrally located to some great shopping, dining, and cultural attractions. One downside is that there is no free wi-fi in the rooms. The hotel is pretty luxurious, but has a little bit of that old school vibe (or charm).;4;1;2;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1807;3/20/2012;GJxE068sgxyS2WnEs0W24g;erEeXxisQTW33M7-TjeJkQ;I really wanted this hotel to be better than it was, but we were a little disappointed. Being such a Chicago landmark, I thought it was going to be as neat as the Intercontinental. The Drake has really old, impressive finishes and the workout room is super impressive (weird comment, I know, but there were wood arched ceilings in there and it was HUGE). But we were really hoping there would be a hot tub (which there wasn't), the fridge in our room was smelly, and they don't let you open the window. Plus we had room service knock on our room twice while we were there, which made us feel like they were trying to hurry us out. Overall, if I were going to pick an old Chicago hotel to stay in, I think I'd still pick the Intercontinental.;3;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1808;3/1/2012;oM8Fk8DqJAaceTm3Q7EM-A;yMR00Vkq46IBebHjtDoygQ;This has got to be one of my favorite hotels in any city. Perfect location and great views of the lake, looking North, it is special in many ways. The front desk and all the staff are first rate, and the rooms are the right blend of "old world" charm, but with all the required modern touches. The food in all the hotel's restaurants is excellent. From the fancy "Cape Cod Room" to the "Drake Brothers" restaurant, and the "Coq D'or" bar (with a more casual menu), you really can't miss. The lobby is very impressive with an amazing central flower arrangement and be sure to spend some time in the "Palm Court" with its' own water feature and flower display. "High Tea" is served every day from 1 to 5PM. Tip: it is worth it to get an executive level room as you will then have access to their executive lounge on the 10th floor. Very good selection of breakfast food and evening appetizers with an amazing view of the lake and the bustling North Lakeshore Drive.;5;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1809;6/20/2012;MhvKLHOX2v-rBiPAiL0waw;jYaXUr4CJs0h-vlO6TprbQ;This review is only for the tea.. been here twice for afternoon tea, and it's fantastic. What's better than an afternoon sipping bottomless tea and eating scones and miniature sandwiches with the sound of a water fountain and harp music in the background? It does cost something like $38 per person, but you get what you pay for - the ambiance, European made China, service, and a perfect hangout place with good friends for a few hours.;5;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1810;12/5/2006;WCRtTuVUg1CiEECPfjqe;ukfZEKae8SLavXHDDwdKBQ;I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  I'm a big gross sweaty mess, even though IT'S TWO DEGREES OUTSIDE.  Why why why why why why?!?!?!?!? (Shut up, it ain't menopause, bitches) So who knows what's going on, but I'm sweating up a freaking storm as I'm waiting in line to check in.  I'm surrounded by a Christmas tree, train tracks, fake presents, and lifesize wooden toy soldiers.  Gag. The line is moving really slow - there are only two people at the check-in counter, and we're about 6 people deep.  I can't help it, I notice a small pool of sweat dripping onto the old carpet.  Seriously, what's wrong with me?!!?  I finally get to the front, check in, get my keys, and turn around to go to the elevator.  Except for I trip.  And I fall.  Like HARDCORE fall.  I throw my luggage up in the air, it knocks over a toy soldier.  One of my shoes comes flying off and hits a guest.  I land face first into the 90 year old carpet.  OH GOD I FELL INTO MY OWN SWEAT PUDDLE.  As I stand up, totally embarassed, I notice MY NOSE IS BLEEDING.  I'm leaving a blood trail on their 90 year old carpet.  I'm a TRAIN WRECK. The Drake Hotel staff runs to my side, asks me if I'm ok, has a towel on my nose, has already adjusted the fallen over human-sized toy soldier, has my luggage on a cart already, and is putting my shoe on already.  Someone hands me a glass of water.  DAMN.  That is SOME SERVICE! Minus two stars because the Drake gave me the wrong key to my room FOUR times.  Which means I had to go back to the scene of the accident FOUR TIMES.  And be stared at by the staff who so thoughtfully helped me FOUR TIMES.  And had to relive my epic fall FOUR TIMES.  How would you feel having to pass by the same person who just saw you flowing BLOOD THROUGH YOUR NOSE again not just 2 minutes earlier?  Might I remind you I hadn't yet gotten a chance to get to my room yet... so I still had BLOOD STAINS on my clothing.  Oh, I don't know if I mentioned - FOUR TIMES.;3;19;20;48;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1811;10/29/2006;qmHdi4kL0Qh1ODG;1oesrOIBYtaJUr2Ug5aioQ;Nice hotel and a great location. However, for the price, I think there are more unique and fun places. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with really nice sheets and cozy pillows, but was pretty generic in decor. Although I was just there for a short time (in at 9pm, out at 11:30am the next), the staff was friendly and helpful. My friend brought some deep dish pizza over, and I called room service to ask for some plates and utensils. They arrived within 10 minutes! Now that's service :) Would recommend it but I'd rather try some other hotels before returning...;4;9;5;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1812;5/31/2010;xT6Ts4MLys7etaivAJeX;JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA;************* REVIEW 156 **************** I've been staying here a few times & the service has always been wonderful, especially the door men, always notice how many outfits I change in a day & compliments my shoes! Got to love that! What can I say about this hotel - the REAL CHICAGO - that hasn't been written before? This historical landmark hotel was the home of many royals, celebs, & in the known people from the Queen to princess Dianna, from many of our former presidents to celebs. So if it was good for them, it's plenty good for small people like me. What I love about this hotel was the perfect location, a few steps to the beach, a short walk to the Oak Street shops, & to the Magnificent Mile. Plenty of restaurants inside the hotel, especially the afternoon high tea,  offer plenty of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. Did I mention the insanely gorgeous Chanel Boutique that I drool each time I stay here. Not to forget the beautiful flowers shop with the cutest dog ever looks just like my late dog. & how can I forget the crystal chandeliers & fresh flowers through out the hotels, simply classic elegant real Chicago landmark. P.S. I also earn points with Hilton Honors too!;4;5;5;2;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1813;7/31/2009;eA1xo-b-qikQE0GJFsokjw;Rx66hbyBmq-Xn5luBbWaOg;I stayed in The Drake while I was taking the bar exam. I didn't want to have to deal with cabs or waking up even earlier for the test, so I just booked a room. My key did not work. I went to get another key. It worked once. Each time I had to enter the room, I had to go back down to the lobby to get a new key. It was so irritating. Additionally - no internet in the rooms. What. The. F.? I get the idea that the only people using the Drake anymore are business men who want to rack up Hilton points and businesses who schedule conferences here. Thus, you NEED internet in the rooms. Additionally, it costs $7.50 / hr to log into WiFi in the lobby. That's absurd. There are three things in this place that say luxury: the huge floral arrangement in the lobby, an excess of crystal light fixtures, and the bedding. Otherwise, this is a totally average hotel with tiny rooms and tiny bathrooms. Our bathroom had a magnification mirror that was affixed to the wall a good foot over my head. Useless.;2;5;3;3;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1814;10/29/2009;v5Ii7a2czQFQNdPg;5qCJ_yMug7EWLNiEQPhcEg;Would Marilyn Monroe ever use Priceline?  Are diamonds forever?  I think not.  Tell that to Kate Winslet. I was horrified to see that a hotel as glamorous as the Drake was using Priceline.  To think that regular people could be walking on the same outdated carpets and watching the same so-90s TVs as Judy Garland or the English Royal Family at $100 per night made me not want to eat for the rest of the week.  Lucky for me it was Ramadan. My two stays at the Drake have been like old-fashioned film noir love-making.  The little sofas in the elevators are to die for.  Who would ever think of putting sofas in their elevators?  Even my luxurious condo in my homeland Dania Beach does not have sofas in the elevators. Ya, and for a building with Chanel on the ground floor, I think Coco would have a chemical reaction to some of the guest rooms.  Go suite or go home.  The regular guest rooms felt dark and dreary.  Old-world style has been replaced for a reason.  I think I've rennovated myself more times in the past six months than the Drake has since 1920. So why give 4 stars you say?  hEllO, this one's easy: because the Drake isn't a hotel.  It's a museum with cleverly-disguised bedrooms.  Of course--because if you pay the same for the chic Swissotel down the street you can't say you walked on the same carpet as Prince Charles, or stood in the same lobby as Frank Sinatra.  And why people complaining about internet??  Of cOUrsE they charge a lot for internet usage in your room, hEllO.  Who goes to a museum and surfs the web?  Not anyone I know. If you want to surf the web or stay in a "hotel," then go to the Best Western in Lakeview.  There is free internet and you're surrounded by gay people, all lovely, but you can't say that you slept in the same place as Frank Sinatra.  Only his wife can say that, or people who have stayed at the Drake. I won't talk about the price of this museum because I don't like to talk about money.  But if I did like to talk about money, I'd say that this museum's entrance fee is pricey on a per/night basis, but could you imagine how much the MoMa would fine you if they caught you sleeping overnight in the Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Gallery?  You are getting 'quite' the bargain. This has been a Review by Fulgencio;4;7;6;11;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1815;3/13/2009;rrr29c6JEXB740WcKCBdcw;rQrqrb5dFztAeFYwyqbygA;I still love this hotel and am excited to see what it will be like after the renovations. My guy likes to stay at the Drake when in town. The executive suites are fantastic - they are spacious and have TWO closets. Ask for one of the rooms with over-sized marble bathrooms. The words over-sized and marble, when put together, make me incredibly happy. The chandeliers in the lobby and extravagant floral arrangements also make me incredibly happy. Also, who can complain when you have Chanel in the same building?;4;4;4;4;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1816;9/17/2010;CEaXKwcTKSRnD;EvXwnFVVYVWPMIT-7AyKZg;As a wedding gift a friend who couldn't make it got us a room for the 4th of July.  In a city where it's next to impossible to get a room on that night, we thought this was a neat idea!  And the reservation aid lakefront view.  Nice! When we checked in we got a 'congratulations' and a 'let me see if I can find you a good room'.  Oooo, thanks! Good room apparently is NOT a lakefront room.  It's facing Michigan Avenue.  And it's under construction.  Boo.  But it was in the corner and the silence was wonderful!   Nice staff, sloooow elevators (but hey, it's old!) and very vintage rooms made for a nice vacation in our own city. And walking down to the end of the street for the fireworks and then back - all in our PJs wasn't too shabby either!  :);4;5;3;4;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1817;1/13/2008;Z3NFxA4piDVMzYRZF8RbNQ;0ISAHQe1Tojcpj8RqVccgw;Okay, I am a Hilton point whore, but that aside, I still love this hotel.  In fact, I love it so much that the fella and I came right after we got married to celebrate! Usual great service at check in (being a HH Diamond probably helps) and congratulations on the nuptials.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the lake and there was a bottle of chilled champagne and a box of chocolates with a note from the manager waiting for us in our room.  In fact, they later sent a second bottle of champagne up! Yes, the Drake will get you drunk as hell on your wedding day, how very thoughtful! Good restaurants, nice bar with hilarious bartenders, great staff, wonderful (recently redone) rooms, ambiance, ambiance, ambiance.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay, we'll definitely be back every year on our anniversary. It's a Chicago classic, period.;5;4;5;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1818;9/8/2011;1huoCCsTOJKccs4H0GJGUg;W-VCxiLlTkM4VMJ8BZVFzw;An Open Letter to The Drake Hotel: I have to say that I was most displeased with the way The Drake Hotel handled a situation early Saturday morning. Just before 1am on 9/3/11, I awoke to screaming from a friend of mine: "SOMEONE JUST RAN OUT OF OUR ROOM!" The two of us who had retired just after midnight awoke startled and saw our other friend who awakened us run out of the room. While we slept, someone had entered our room and taken the cash ($300) out of my friend's wallet on the nightstand next to the bed. They then proceeded to reach over me while I slept on my cot and took the cash out of my wallet ($250), which was on the floor next to me. They then left the room and encountered our friend in the hallway. The security staff at The Drake Hotel was less than helpful. They took a report and left us with the phrase, "Well, these things happen." When we asked them to call the police for us the best they could do was give us a phone number (the wrong one) and we had to call CPD ourselves. The police have been most helpful and the detective in charge has informed us that he thinks he knows who committed the crime. These leads me to believe that this is probably not the first time something like this has happened at The Drake. I am most bothered by two things. First, at no time were we dealt with as victims of a crime by the staff at The Drake. Rather, we were treated like ignorant tourists, unaware of life in Chicago. There was no sympathy - only bored indifference. Secondly, The Drake has a stated policy behind the front desk that says no one without a key card will be allowed in after midnight. When we arrived back to our room on Saturday AFTER MIDNIGHT, no one stopped us to check our room key or even acknowledged our presence. Sunday after midnight however, we were stopped - a welcome change to be sure but TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. This incident could have been so much worse and I am still haunted by the "what ifs." What if I had woken up as some criminal reached over me to grab my wallet? It is not a far stretch to imagine that I could have been injured or even killed. Would the staff of The Drake have cared then? My group has been coming to The Drake for years in order to celebrate Notre Dame's opening weekend. We have always assumed that we would be safe inside her walls - an assumption that we will never make again. Not only has The Drake Hotel lost our business but it, along with the entire Hilton chain, has lost our trust. Since The Drake Hotel has decided to ignore our situation and refuses to even regard it with an apology, I will take all measures to spread the word about what happened. Along with passing a warning to visitors on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media avenues, I also intend to publish an editorial regarding the event in my magazine. I'm sad that it has come to this. I expected better from such a reputable American institution.;1;13;0;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1819;1/5/2009;VVkGJgj-01RfabEYrDKkeQ;R-q1NjCaBHabVCsq9_Y0kA;Since I'm around people who love tea as much as I do (for once in my life), we all thought it would be a great idea to have high tea one weekend. The Drake Hotel offers just that for $31. I originally thought the price was a bit high, but after going, I think it's well worth it. When we arrived, we were a bit confused on where to go. There are signs pointing the way to the tea room, so be sure to look for them. I did not see them and god knows how long it would have taken for me to find the area. I usually just wander. Anyway, once they took out coats, we were seated right away. The tea room, while large, was incredibly crowded. I didn't think having tea like this was popular, but apparently it is. I ordered the Irish Breakfast Tea, and it was wonderful. We were brought these large tea pots that were refilled with hot water constantly, as well as finger sandwiches, scones, and a variety of desserts. The finger sandwiches originally didn't look very good, but after trying a few I thought they were amazing! The scones were so-so, but the desserts were terrible. We spent almost 3 hours there, and I was completely stuffed by the time we left. I would definitely recommend this place for tea lovers!;5;4;2;2;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1820;6/16/2009;krviZIzYO-Ls;XKAFikZAfddYv0Vg1PUkwA;Stayed with a friend here this winter.  I loved the HUGE Christmas tree in the lobby!  So beautiful! The bedroom was a little small, but the bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was spacious.  Great closet space, and you can't complain about the view of the lake!  :-)  (Granted it was like -20 outside!) I wouldn't mind coming back to stay here :-);4;3;3;2;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1821;6/28/2008;cPrxPtF3a-v3aZk;Zjlg-6wSt4v1ljPKQ5y5tg;The lobby is very nice and ornate.  It's "historic" I suppose, and it should be respected for being a landmark, but it's too old and tired for me. The room was a little bigger than a shoe box, and the bathroom didn't have enough room to change into the robes hanging on the door.  The view was nothing more than the windows and concrete of more buildings.  I'm sure if you get something overlooking the lake, it's better, but the TV was tiny, the bed was hard and a wee bit sagging, and the staff, pretty snooty. Again, the lobby and stairs are really nice.  Too bad the rooms aren't more like that.;2;2;1;2;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1822;3/10/2011;8-gtCsb1jBc6RJMr0FBGDQ;v9X3Ym_9r9ZFa4-z-WvrQw;The Drake Hotel is like a hug from your grandmother, comforting and familiar, a little worn-in and cozy. I loved my big king bed - and my room was larger than my apartment in Brooklyn. So nice! The towels were kinda shitty, the shower curtain was worn, the wallpaper was a bit peely in the bathroom, but it was clean. If they could fix that, and get better bath products, it'd get 5 stars.;4;0;1;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1823;4/30/2006;AZ-3edtjJVwjNKdLe3dSyg;om5ZiponkpRqUNa3pVPiRg;The drake is definitely a classy hotel, but I agree with Kiki that it could use a little bit of a makeover. The lobby and rooms are very nice, but it doesn't even compare to The Peninsula and some of the newer popoular hotels in Chicago. Edit 1/3/07: Attended a tea party for a friend's bday at the Drake today.  It was a wonderful day and I had fun celebrating, but not overly impressed with tea at the Drake.  The tea was good, but the sandwiches were pretty gross...hardly compares to tea at the Ritz and/or the Peninsula.;3;2;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

1826;5/28/2010;aeIglpDNVl-V-v8fErMDyA;Lk2v1UguYZ9aPEUVDGMEzA;Review of high tea: PROS: 1) GREAT selection of tea.  I went with 3 friends (4 people total) and we each tried the others' teas.  Everything was fabulous. 2) Good service. 3) Nice variety of sandwiches, scones, breads, and desserts. 4) A harp player!!!  It really set the ambiance and made it a relaxing experience.  We also came with a 2 year old who was entranced by the music and kept going up to the harpist.  She was more than friendly with my niece!! 5) Nice bathrooms! 6) They refill our teapots with hot water quite often, so we always had lots of tea!  And my tealeaves still produced yummy (and flavorful tea) even after the 3rd refill of hot water. CONS: 1) The person who brought our food spoke so quickly that we couldn't understand anything he said.;5;2;1;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1827;5/28/2007;nilU1HX2XGdr97q89Oh0QQ;0MFR6Su_osQ2h8mkNu4sPg;The Drake, for all you tourists and business travelers about to visit Chicago, is one of Chicago's classic hotels.  The Drake Hotel sign is clearly visible on the Chicago skyline, so you can't miss it.  I stayed there during a conference (thankfully paid for by my firm, since it's not cheap) and had a very pleasant stay.   While my colleagues were staying at more modern places like the W or the Marriot, I enjoyed the old-school vibe that the Drake had to offer.  No, there is no WiFi connection in the rooms, but the Ethernet jack in my room worked just fine.  I had a large corner room, which overlooked Michigan Ave.  I could have paid a little extra and got a lake view, but decided against it (at least on this trip). The WOW factor was clearly in effect too, since many of my resident Chicago friends were clearly impressed that I was staying at the Drake.   One thing to keep in mind is that the Drake is pretty far from the Convention Center, but getting a cab there took no more than 10-15 minutes.;3;1;1;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

The room was very well appointed. My biggest negative is that they have no wi-fi access in the rooms, only the lobby area. Although they did have a hard wired internet connection that you could connect to your laptop at the work-desk. The bellmen at the door are fantastic. Always quick to get a cab and help you in and out. The hotel seemed to have been recently refurbished. Very nice condition for such an old historic location. I will definitely be back.;4;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1829;8/31/2011;sG5ii0Xpzr;G4Ir4C_jhp3lPD0CMgpvgQ;The Drake is famous, and justifiably so. The lobby is relatively small, but more importantly it is tasteful and refined. No riff-raff lounging around as in New York's Waldorf=Astoria. However, some of the aspects of the Drake that can be cited for their traditional charm, such as the mirrored elevators with their upholstered benches, also betray the need for some updates. Service, including check-in, was as it should be-- quick, seamless, and nearly invisible. The rooms are highly variable, but even the standard ones are large enough. Quality everything, from bedding to bath supplies, but some things felt a bit in need of an update, such as the carpet and chair upholstery. It's possible to be traditional without being fusty. Where the Drake really shines the most, though, are in its restaurants. The Palm Court is a true delight. Beautiful room and furnishings, delicious tea and food (it's far more than it initially looks), impeccable service, and a harpist. It's quiet and relaxing while being social. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, come for the tea. Breakfast at the Drake Bros was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, with an enormous selection and, again, impeccable service. You get the privacy you want, too. Considering the price and the reputation, this is everything you expect. No less, but not much more, either.;3;2;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1830;8/16/2011;rMRM;PuMG1ZMZYR_F_aFoefiHHg;The finest hotel in Chicago, my family has stayed here on several occasions when in the city. The hotel itself is extremely elegant, in fact regal.

For a hotel that charges as much as it does, I'm amazed at the way the Drake nickels and dimes their guests for everything!  My parents stayed here while I was finishing my MA, and while the place is beautiful, seeing my dad have to constantly open his wallet made me feel generally underwhelmed about the whole place.;3;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1832;11/21/2011;u-Ns1g5UmmEf8SwPiVW13g;le3q1LEoDlI5wSsWUvAE7w;Beautiful hotel. One of Chicago's finest.  Be warned, because it's an older hotel, there is no WiFi.  I am in a gigantic suite, it's fantastic.  Ordered room service and it was up within 10 minutes.  Very large gym that's open 24 hours.;4;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1833;1/19/2007;4oGxXu9FuB2Z1VMd0SU23A;RV9-XCz9TKLaHpNRiwWeEg;High Tea at the Drake is quite an experience.  Certainly the most expensive tea and finger sandwiches you'll ever eat, but you pay for the experience.  It is sort of like playing pretend.   It is way better during the Christmas season, but I'd make reservations in advance if that is your plan.  The hotel is always decorated well and feels festive.  This is a nice place for a group of girlfriends and could be a neat yearly tradition to start.  You don't need to go more than once a year but I'd try it for fun.;4;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1834;9/26/2007;gA6trlxy4AF1ZEKHcI2BPQ;heKYqXpx9kvQMzoDOVHxaQ;Ugh.  I hate giving this place even one star.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Not what i expected AT ALL.  Who expects to have a list with 12 - that's right TWELVE - complaints (in one room) after my 4 day stay here. For freakin' $425.00 a night, someone should have rubbed my feet before I went to bed! or at least I shouldn't have awoke in the middle of the night itching like crazy TWICE!!!  This place is OLD and though "The Drake" sounds all hoity toity, it is NOT all that it is cracked up to be.  The staff was 50/50.   Don't stay in room 415.  It stinks and I think it has bed bugs.  I'm not joking.;1;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1835;10/7/2009;-tDsnhDLDG0FiMyoC9c0nA;rP8ucq6h7B8FsKZlABl-qQ;Same review as the Palmer House, and must be indicative of all the hilton hotels.  Grand beautiful lobby, nice ballrooms.  But then you get upstairs, and its like the money ran out.  Old dingy carpets, old wallpaper, old tvs, ugly bedspreads and artwork, just all around outdated.  Had a window, but it opened up to a wall of another wing of the hotel.  Bed was comfortable, room was large, and good water pressure in the shower.   Was here for a conference and heard everyone else had nice rooms, so maybe it was just me.;3;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1836;6/23/2009;6NK6ObCr4rRQUDmQSRDiVA;BW2-ad2rxu-vYBCn9fQm2Q;Stayed at this hotel for 3 days for the neocon event. It is right at Michigan ave and close by Lake Michigan. It is a really nice walk from the CTA station and close by the bus transit. I enjoy staying in the hotel because they upgrade our room to Family room with 2 bathroom ( really awesome) . The bed sheets are clean and there are 2 TVs. The front desk is really friendly and we even have a limo ride to the gangster tour for free. You just need to ask them. I didn't have a chance to try the high tea because it costs around $30 per perosn. it it too much for me. The lounge is really fancy and you actually need to dress nice to be able to fit in to the area.;3;0;1;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1837;5/16/2011;hgZO8-eEmhNAprDIid7rAQ;iHpgXsAkBXQD2NmPbdDw0g;Wow. It's amazing how far a "name" will get you. Didn't think it was possible for a hotel to get away with such terrible service in a highly competitive market as the Chicago hotel market. These people really could give a rat's ass about their customers. From wait staff, to security, hands down worst service I have ever experienced, and I have stayed in hotels all over the world. Trust me when I say, the Holiday Inn Express a few blocks away destroys them in service and accomodations. In terms of the actual hotel. Extremely dated and cheap looking. Probably considered classy during the Nixon administration. Thin walls. Crappy furniture. Funny smelling carpet.  Laughable elevator bank  with an Atari game-looking elevator indicator screen (no offense to Atari). Clientele - old (ancient) money and white trash. weird combo for sure. Stay away. If you are going to spend that much money, do yourself a favor and stay at a hotel where they give a damn.;1;3;0;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1838;1/4/2009;jsO5H4NIfMot-nVoZNZ4NA;oOV3teAh5SOlH2D0nTW8iQ;Loved the Drake burger. A sizzling patty of corn-fed Midwestern Black Angus beef that was perfect after a long flight from SF. I also loved the sense of history, the location and the immensity of the rooms. The Manhattan I downed at the Coq D'Or was a serious concoction. I hated that my girlfriend and I ended up in a smoking room after explicitly requesting a non-smoking room and I really hated that they lost/hadn't moved our bags from the smoking room to the non-smoking room on day two of our stay. It took multiple calls to the front desk from our new non-smoking room and a visit to the front desk to get this resolved. We got a coupon for a free breakfast for having to stay in the smoking room. For the lost bags they offered another breakfast coupon. Pathetic. I informed the staff that I would stay at the Peninsula on my next visit as a result of the lost bags and the subsequent coupon offer. They ended up giving us 25% off the stay, which was thoughtful, but the damage was done. I recommend visiting the Drake for a drink. Try a modern hotel for your stay.;2;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

We booked a reservation with Shaun Rajah Manager of the Palm Court Room who is awesome to deal with--Thanks Shaun for making it effortless,especially with 20 ladies. The high tea is top notch and always an experience with the Harpist playing. We will be Back;5;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1840;9/9/2009;FSu0qIQoUAW5ZUwPiznzMQ;ZMmv0nxvi2e5oRTH5PeXDw;Recently stayed at the Drake Hotel (4 nights). The hotel itself was beautiful! The staff was very helpful and friendly. Beds were very comfortable as well. The only downside was the fact that the rooms are not standard queen/king beds. --They have rooms with two twin beds and one bathroom, but in order to have a room with two queen beds, you have to upgrade to a suite, which includes two bathrooms. Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant or tea, unfortunately. Overall, the stay was good.;3;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1841;10/23/2006;Pit0lMaeg16mWqJrsqrZ5Q;qjkOmSEFFEeWVTtsIl0aAw;High Tea at The Drake - what a great way to spend a chilly Chicago afternoon.  I haven't been to tea at The Drake in 10 years and not much has changed--the service is still warm and attentive, the tea sandwiches are still yum-yummy and the pastries are still delish.  Now that I'm all growed up, though, I think I would actually rather have another round of sandwiches than any pastries at all--they stole the show for me, especially the little guy with asparagus.  I must remember to include asparagus in more of my sandwich creations!   I think I would take off half a star for the whipped cream with the scones--from a can, Drake?  Really?  I expect more from you.  Even I make my own homemade whipped cream and it doesn't take much.  But alas, the little asparagus sandwich silences any complaints and the soothing harp lilting in the background makes any conversation or group of rapscallions seem more civilized.  Even though I'm pretty sure I was the only rapscallion there. :) Wear your pearls or wear neat jeans (or both), practice pinkies up and enjoy a pampered afternoon of quiet service and tasty treats.  I will be back--hopefully before another 10 years roll around.;5;2;1;2;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1842;5/16/2011;KOzpn;HHLzkWZY5Yrg4ffSiHTUdw;This place is obviously trying to live off its name, location, and reputation.  But this should be rated based on what you get today, and thats not much. Went to a wedding here and while it sounded so nice to go to a wedding at the Drake, there are far superior hotels in chicago.  I am not even talking about decor because that is everyones personal taste.  But, when it comes to service, theres either good service or bad service.  This was bad service.  I even saw the concierge recommend an italian restaurant to a lady asking for a good japanese food.  I guess they just have their list of what they like and stick with it without thinking about what you really want. DONT EVER LOSE ANYTHING HERE!  SECURITY DOES NOT LIKE TO PICK UP THEIR PHONE!  AND IF YOU EVER TRY GOING THROUGH THE OPERATOR TO TALK TO SECURITY, THEY WILL DROP YOUR CALL. I won't go into specifics, but its sad to see one of the finer and more reputable hotels in chicago go so far downhill.  Whatever your choice in decor is, thats fine.  But a hotel with this price point should have better service.;1;3;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1843;11/25/2005;8xkg3f45N57W0c0sEklasA;7clk7hJlh9U5Kkwq7IGLEw;Went for high tea here recently. Its definitely an experience to have at some point. You get to choose from a bunch of different teas, finger sandwhiches, scones, and pastries. At about $35 per person, its quite hefty for afternoon tea, but the entire experience is lovely. The atmosphere, service, and ambiance are really amazing and it makes for a very relaxing, yet elegant occassion. And of course the beautiful harp adds a very elegant touch.;5;2;1;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1844;5/8/2009;28h0JfaPwn2MxjrPccgFIg;nGMStryAqmp-ctWzm0xlaQ;OK, I'm bummed about this because I just gave them four starts. But it turns out they double charged me for some of my mini bottle drinks and I have had duplicate charges on my credit card since April 27th. 3 phone calls and 2 emails later, no one has helped me. They keep telling me they are going to resolve it, but its getting a little tiresome. I mean - its $35 dollars from the Drake, but dammit, I booked through Priceline. I'm not a big spender and I just want my money back. :(;3;2;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1845;6/19/2006;irR3YJ4LPqj0BhQ5W1vXVw;NBdzPjWUgebZOHP4cVTFlA;Had afternoon tea party at the Palm Court. I thought this place was elegant, however old fashioned. The finger sandwiches and scones were good, but nothing to rave about. I had better afternoon tea sandwiches at a less luxurious place. Tea selection and variety could expand as well. The harpist in the background was a nice touch. Service and ambiance were wonderful. Loved the powder room :);3;2;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

The best high tea in Chicago!! Thank you Shaun Rajah for always making our experience spectacular!;5;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1850;4/28/2006;uZtJKlXCEkLx2XOUdsORCA;EIyTcGYHaFuTYiAPdZ0Piw;I always thought this was a really nice hotel, but I had a friend stay here recently when she was in town and I wasn't too impressed with her room. It was nice, but I expected more from the Drake. I think it's starting to get run down and could use a makeover.;3;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1851;2/4/2011;JY9VSbXqeuUNScJs0eDM5A;5l6csJmi1FX17oHuufivoQ;We had a fantastic room overlooking Lake Michigan (in the summer). Beautiful. A must stay location in Chicago.;5;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1852;12/4/2008;y9yZ4VO-jm9kTUcBE9-g2g;JPT7zRf8RjMSVyM0Y43b6Q;I enjoyed staying here immensely. The staff at The Drake treat their guests like royalty and, with the beautiful lobby and glamorous history, you will feel like royalty as well. My mom and I stayed here last summer in one of the suites. However, they had overbooked that night and ended up having to place us in a smoking wing. My mom is extremely sensitive to smoke smell and I don't care for it either. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do about it so they upgraded our room. The suite we ended up getting was beautiful-- it was a corner room so it was bigger than most and had a wonderful view of the lake. We actually witnessed a tornado by watching it sweep across the lake from the safety of our room. I'm a big fan of historic buildings and luxurious and over-the-top decor. Give me blood red velvet curtains and gold embossed leather walls and I'm a happy woman. So you can see why I was so impressed with The Drake. The clientele this hotel attracts is equally impressive. I was in the tea room the same day a woman was throwing her bridal shower there. When I went to the powder room (really, "bathroom" doesn't do it justice), I overheard the woman crying about a lost diamond ring and her friends trying to convince her it's not a big deal at all. You can bet I was on the floor looking for it. The Drake is a wonderful place to stay if you're on a vacation that you want to make extra glamorous, decadent or special. On that same note, I wouldn't recommend it to business travelers as there are no office-type amenities and, while the service is great, the staff tend to take their time.;4;0;0;1;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1853;1/13/2010;9bfUqx2uWTxMQP62fwmREw;bvGO_TqdIXFo-mNj2SsXhA;Drake = disappointing Having lived in Chicago my entire life, I was PUMPED about a night at the Drake. It's an icon... looking all magnificent and dignified when you see it while driving down LSD.   A good friend of mine decided to use his points to treat my husband and myself to a night downtown for my birthday. The Mr. had bought tickets for Mary Poppins and was taking me out for sushi... it was shaping up to be a pretty bitchin' birthday. Check in: quick, painless. Lobby is impressive. Rooms: Frankly, I've stayed in better hotels that charge less per night. What you're getting at the Drake is location... well... that and customer service (supposedly). The beds were comfy, the bathroom nice but it all left me underwhelmed. Except for the view. The view of LSD was awesome.  The beds were super comfy... I will certainly give them that. A run down of our experience:   Customer service: not great. Not even good.  My friends had decided to order us some appetizers and a birthday cake and have it delivered to our room.  They requested it be delivered after 6:00 to ensure that we were settled in before it came.  Pretty much moments after we got into our room at 3:30-ish, we had a knock on the door.  The spread was awesome but I feel bad that our friends had requested a specific time and it was disregarded.  Oh well.  So we went out, had a great evening... had a great sleep... then upon checkout, saw that the room had been charged for the cake and apps that our friends had sent.  Me being the one who never wants to create trouble just told my husband to charge the expense... it was a nice thought but they shouldn't have to pay for our cake.  But he insisted just in case we were BOTH charged for that goofy cake.  So, he called our friends who were then embarassed.  It took a few minutes for us to clear it up at the hotel but our poor friend was dealing with it for days.   I guess the long and the short is that we were supposed to have awesome customer service and didn't get it.  Super disappointing.  If we ever want to do a night downtown again, we might as well go to the Westin or something down the street that is going to be cheaper with better service.   But MANY THANKS to our generous friends that hooked up the room and treats!  :);3;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1854;6/20/2010;UHVj2b4vnZ6pyvDh75O91A;7fpz-KTsgEhFS72o4F2sFQ;We went to Chicago for our first time just recently, and of course we had to stay at the historic Drake Hotel. It was certainly very beautiful. The next night we actually ended up staying at The Talbott hotel because this place was booked, so after that stay, I could see why I prefer boutique hotels better, like The Talbott.  The Drake had a lot of beautiful chandeliers and the atrium was amazing. I enjoyed the many references to the Queen of England, which made the place seem more regal. I did feel like I was on a special vacation being there, but the nice luxury 'special' touches that The Talbott had were missing from The Drake. Perhaps it's because it's owned by the Hilton and every Hilton hotel room is standardized the same, so that charm was kinda missing. Either way, it was a beautiful hotel and our view of Lake Michigan was really nice. We also snuck a peek of all the ballrooms and wow, are they BEAUTIFUL! What an amazing place to get married in! The one thing that really made it seem less charming was their breakfast buffet. Our waiter took a little while and the buffet was a little over $20 for nothing outstanding at all. I think the menu food is quite a bit better so I would order from that instead. All in all, it was a nice stay.;4;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1855;10/9/2010;PZjwoRYkYXCXIAZWXyX;t1f1ynMSjuSpqUhc14Cv-Q;This review is for the bar only.  Maybe my expectations were to high considering this is a very well-known hotel with a lot of history, but I found their bar to be lame, shabby, and just kinda depressing.  I guess they were going for a saloon feel but it came off more like a big red cheesy mess. And the prices were insane.  We also had appetizers which basically sucked.  I hear they have some kind of high noon tea in a tea room there or something like that.  I'll try that next.  Anything is a step up from this bar experience.;2;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1856;6/1/2010;v0aukqY2-e3LKJGgbczEYg;mtXkbpwaQemvGVckdJbBkA;Crushed velvet handrails - need I say more?!! This place blew my mind. I filmed a wedding here last weekend so needless to say I saw every aspect of this building, at all times of the day for 14 hours straight. If you're thinking of getting married here, DO IT. I truly have never seen a more gorgeous wedding - yes expensive but WORTH IT. I ate breakfast at the smaller (nonaligned) restaurant here and I was not impressed. The staff seemed to have been working here since the building was build but their attitudes were less than great. I also did get the last 15 minutes of the buffet but still, not impressed. The food for the wedding however was RIDICULOUS, I'm assuming they didn't bring in their own chef but who knows, I could be wrong. I wish I could be more help in the food area, but the building itself is incredible. Having passed this place over a hundred times on Lake Shore Drive and never have gone it, I was impressed. The Drake keeps the old feel of a vintage Chicago hotel while beaming with style and class of the upper social standings of millionaires. I felt...regal :);4;0;1;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1857;11/27/2011;4cwF8kx9FyecLEqh2sProQ;D0fjnDQQRBCip4lUrmSldQ;Wonderful stay. My husband and I took our 3 kids there over Thanksgiving, ages 12, 15 and 18. The double Queen family room was big with 2 bathrooms and a sofa bed. They do have roll sways if needed. The workout room was 3000 sq. Feet w/ 10 treadmills. We were right next to all the shops on Mag. Mile. The hotel lobby court was wonderful for drinks and a snack before bed with great music. The hallways to the rooms are extra wide and just nice. It is very elegant and historic. We had our iPads w/ our own Internet so we didn't experience any issues there. The price was $259/night and $35/ parking. We thought it was great and will stay there next time too!;5;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

Just to make sure I didn't put my eggs all in one basket, I went to look at several other venues such as the River East Arts Center, The University Club of Chicago, Metropolitan Club, and Spiaggia. Nothing read Chicago elegance like the Drake. Kate Strause was amazing from the day we said we wanted our wedding here, up until the day after our wedding, when she arranged to have some belongings we forgot at the hotel delivered to my brother's house. Every little detail was perfectly in order and made our wedding feel truly 5-star without any "attitude," which was very important to the both of us. She even helped us with our strict kosher requirements and was an excellent liason with Daniziger, our caterer.;5;4;2;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1870;11/29/2010;WoxUT;fFBQaHFLdaV6-28Yn1r-nw;Took my sister to afternoon tea for her birthday. I made reservations over the phone which was easier than doing it online because online (via phone) I kept getting an error message. The reservation was from 1pm. The reservation deskperson had told me not to be more than 10 minutes late as they don't hold reservations past that time. Each seating is 1 hr and 30 minutes so we were there until 2:30. The Palm Court is in the lobby area and the hotel is beautifully decorated for Xmas. Also, if you have the dough to spend, the Chanel store is attached to the hotel. There is a very tall, well decorated tree when you go up the stairs to the Palm Court area from the lobby. It is definitely worth a kodak moment. The hostess was very polite and seated us immediately. There was only one waiter and at least 7 tables of people seated for tea. With the afteroon tea, they serve 4 types of sandwiches, egg salad, cucumber tomato, asparagus/ham and roast beef. My sister didn't want the beef so we got extra egg salad sandwiches. They were all very good but I would have loved a choice of breads for the sandwiches. Also the tea came with our choice of tea, we each got a teapot. I had the dulce and she had the pear caramel. They allow you to try other teas and so we also tried the chocolate peppermint. My favorite was pear caramel. Also, the tea came with 4 small pastries, raisin scones and banana bread. The scones were soft and still warm. Overall, the service was decent and they constantly filled our teapots with water.The ambious is great but for $33 a person plus tip,  it may be more worth it to come for a cocktail.;3;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1871;9/8/2010;TcgFUYYG3kO3D052Y3gVTA;_TS0tZ5SmShQK6nYGa9IDQ;Gorgeous hotel. I work for a wedding planning company and have the same exact review as Neha K. We have worked a handful of weddings at ritzy hotels, and we had great expectations for the drake. However, all the vendors were given a room (the one room without any camera) that we were told would be safe. Towards the end of the night, an iphone goes missing as well as a good chunk of money. We find that our wallets had been opened and were on top of our bags. TALK about feeling violated. This has never ever happened to us before. Guests had no access to the room and we had seen a man in the drake uniform walk in and quickly walk out of the room. It was obviously one of the drake employees, I'm sure they are pretty aware of the fact that they had no cameras in that particular room. Also, the worst part is that when we complained all they did was "file a report" and when asked if this has ever happened before the security officer replied "not really"....what do you mean not really? How disgusting! To make things even worse, he removed himself from taking responsibility of the situation by saying they hire a lot of their staff to work larger events, just sort of freelanced..he made it seem like they hired people off the streets /// do they even do background checks on who they hire? Guests pay A LOT of money for these rooms and I wonder if anything has ever been stolen from the rooms. It is appalling that nothing was done, we weren't reimbursed. They didn't even take the initiative to look into the cameras in the hallway at least to see if anyone had walked in and out of the rooms. I have lost any and ALL respect for this hotel, and we will never recommend clients to this hotel ever again.;1;1;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
1872;12/29/2010;ZFwQVza87jymynDy;3tvHDIXJXfI1n_0US1y0Zg;This Hotel service and staff is hands down UNMATCHED.  I met a friend in the city that I hadn't seen in some time. After we shopped and ate it was very late and while we both live in the suburbs we decided to get a room in the city and continue the fun. She suggested the Drake having been there for the tea room only days before..and while I could care less about the tea room I wanted a High End upscale room for the night. First of all this Hotel is Dated, it reminded me of "old Chicago" almost as if you stepped back in time. These staff members and servers were beyond friendly and helpful to her and I.  Our room was right around 300 for the night and honestly worth every cent. King sized bed two beautiful bathrooms and elite room service. Alot of wannabe hotels claim to be classy and yet their staff shows otherwise. I plan on going back and staying for fun in the future. Well worth the money.;5;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

1874;11/26/2008;KhfZGwEegjzsZFABYJTNuA;Y6Z6iXxYwZnctq3E7jUEwA;A very historic looking building.  I have status with Hilton so when I stayed here they upgraded me to an executive floor and a pretty large room.  I tried to request a suite, but they couldn't give it to me.  No matters though I was here with the wife, but I was in town for work and I'd be only at the hotel to sleep anyway.  The room was spacious and there were two bathrooms, which made the morning convenient for us.  The gym has pretty modern equipment and it's decent from what I can remember.  I was working late a l ot of the days so I barely had time to use the gym.  The hotel front desk staff and all other staff were all very friendly and hospitable.  There's always Granny Smiths apples at the front desk which I can grab a couple and eat them later.  I also have access to their club floor to have breakfast and end of the day cocktail hour.  The view from the club floor is sweet.  It overlooks Lake Michigan and you can have your breakfast and enjoy the view.  This place is right by Michigan Ave so you can get to all the shops from here not to mention hop on a bus to get where you need to.  My wife and I took the bus to park during the weekend when the Taste of Chicago was going on.;4;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

1877;9/2/2012;pfgtgsiQ6Kht44tX5-nGVw;qsiSQiSLq-I74PD7YreXGg;I stayed here for two nights last winter due to an overnight layover with Amtrak.  It was a unique building, that's for sure, like being inside a giant fish bowl.  I was up pretty high, floor 19ish, with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking State Street.  In fact, you can feel the vibration at times from the subway.   The room was posh and ultra-modern and had one of the oddest bathrooms I've ever seen, almost completely glassed in with a window in the shower looking out into the rest of the room, which means your traveling companions would have a birds eye view of the shower and pretty much anything taking place in the bathroom, it is not suitable for family members, college buddies, or anybody else you might be rooming with, and if one of em happens to be a perv they can peak through the shower curtain which will be on their side, not yours. Also keep in mind that if your in a room with the floor to ceiling windows, the condos across state street will also have full view of your showering activities and binoculars would not be necessary, it's close enough that you could almost have a conversation with someone if you knew sign language or could read lips.  I was in a corner suite and the neighboring buildings on the other side were about a block away so at least I could have the shades open and not feel like I was giving somebody a show unless of course I forgot to pull the strange sliding closet door shut.   Someone else commented on noise in their review, I didn't make any myself, but I did hear a couple somewhere on my floor partaking in extracurricular activities, mid-afternoon mind you, and it sounded like they were trying to kill each other.  I seriously thought somebody was in pain and thought about calling the front desk.  I don't know if it was the all glass aspect of the place, but noise travels in this building so if this is what you intend to come to this place for, keep in mind you will be heard by everybody on the floor. I had to blast the heat because it was winter and had all that glass, and I suspect cooling the room would be an issue in the summer, but I was still very comfortable.  The bed was fantastic, wifi worked like a charm, and the mini-bar came in handy, just be prepared to not have much room if you bring your own provisions, it was so packed in that one of the wine bottles fell out onto the hardwood floor, fortunately it didn't break. I used the steam room in the "spa", but was disappointed at the lack of a sauna, I never did see the fitness center and not sure there even was one.  I did not use room service, the staff of the hotel was accomodating and professional, I found the desk clerks to be a little too stiff, but nothing terrible, I'm just used to Hilton and Hyatt and wanted to try out a boutique hotel for a change of pace.  As a construction worker I felt pretty out of place, you would definitely feel at home if your a Rock Star or some other artsy fartsy type though. Bottom line, I think this sort of place is fine for honeymooners that can't stand to be apart for five minutes, hence the always visible toilet/shower.  And it's probably ok for singles such as myself too, but families and groups or businesspeople trying to save money and doubling up, you're in for some awkward moments.;4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1878;7/22/2012;6ccgtB;pbyxWMCyRe8_NZihJToYKw;Very peaceful hotel. We really loved this hotel. The location could not be beat and the rooms were cozy. Great little balcony on our room which sealed the deal. Although we didn't eat at the hotel during our stay we did head up to the rooftop bar a couple times. What a spectacular location and view. We will return.;5;1;1;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1880;6/6/2012;T6EMYwtJXSNBpmJk3rDk8g;zx5rdBK9NFZrAglIXF1LiQ;We had done extensive research on where to stay, location of the hotel, prices and etc. The reviews were and -'s.. but the positives outweighed it and we gave it a shot and were we impressed! Positives. *Decor is undeniably exquisite which added value to our overall experience. *The door staff is courteous from beginning to end of our stay.. anywhere from offering to take our bags to our room, to opening the door (chilvary isn't dead here), to hailing cabs, directions, you name it.. they were there. *Front desk and concierge were helpful for all of our needs including a change of room, which the front desk provided the day after our initial stay which we didn't mind as we came to check in at 2am and weren't even thinking about relocating. *The rooms were great, the showeris definitely a conversation piece with the clear glass dividing the shower and the bedroom. *The bed and pillows were super comfy! We wanted to take it home along with the bedding. *Big flat tv, Keurig machine with coffee and tea cartridge, affordable mini bar, ipod/iphone player, alarm clock, office desk. *Bathroom necessities always plentiful. (Shower gel, Shampoo, ear buds, towels) *Vertigo was a nice amenity *Great location - right in the heart of downtown. Close to restaurants, transit stops, theater, etc. *They kept our baggage in storage for the last few hours we were in Chicago to sightsee! That was very helpful of them. *Housekeeping was very attentive and when there was a request.. they were right behind it. *Free use of the in room safe was definitely a reassurance. *We were staying on the 14th floor which didn't seem to hear the reminants of the Friday and Saturday night partying up on the roof, any further up I would reconsider, but the hotel front desk are really conscious of it at the time of booking. Cons. There were a couple of mis-design, but nothing too major. *In the first room, 11th floor (no floor to ceiling windows, but it did have a balcony), there was a shower door that leaked into the bathroom.. there was a good half an inch space between the door and the wall. We were switched into the comfy king due to personal request, we were situated into an upgrade of a room located on the 14th floor -which was excellent. *I particularly did not like the fact that there was not an entrance solely for Vertigo. The bar patrons were using the same elevators as guest who were staying at the hotel. Could be a security flaw, but we weren't particularly bothered but you never know. *The walls are thin, but it didn't seem to bother us at all. *The city sounds were serene to us, but for some could be bothersome. *The window blinds would be one solitary blind as opposed to three different un-overlapping blind that would let sun through.. not good for those that only sleep in complete darkness. N/A. Did not have any experience in the following. Room Service Pay per view channels Exercise Room Aja - In house restaurant. MiniBar - did not purchase. I would definitely favor this hotel on our next trip back to Chicago.";5;2;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1881;12/13/2011;qdqbMD8OlJjGfyjAFteemg;q_QQ5kBBwlCcbL1s4NVK3g;Dana is like a stereotypical fashion model: wonderful to look at but sorta empty on the inside and a strange mix of narcissistic and insecure. Let's do the math: Upon arrival I was greeted by the always friendly door men at the entrance (+1), and then waited and rode one floor up in an elevator to the lobby (-1) where I was summarily ignored by the two people sitting at reception. After attempting to use the strange computer kiosk check-in I finally flagged down someone to help get me my key (-1). This person was openly rude and disparaging to me for no particular reason, spending five minutes lecturing me on how not to book a room through Expedia - note that I was not the person who booked the room. This became an even larger problem when, despite taking both my ID, credit card and a signed form - they booked me into Colleen's room (-1). I'll let her explain the appalling shit storm that ensued after this mistake but needless to say, they need to hire hospitality staff and problem solvers, not petty people who hate their jobs.   The room itself was tiny and dark, the only natural sunlight came from a door to a small balcony (-1). I'm a sucker for balconies (+1). While that shower head could bring world peace with the perfect rain of water that flows out of it (+1), the shower itself was cramped and the complimentary toiletries seemed cheap (-1). But they did provide plenty of towels, cotton swabs, q-tips and a strong hair dryer so I just used the products I packed and went on my merry way (+1). The bed was comfortable (+1) and room service came fast and fresh (+1). Stay away from the in room snacks, despite looking tasty and locally sourced, they are old and stale. All of them. But the mini bar prices are super reasonable so I know you'll be tempted. Overall, it was decent. There were a lot of flaws but it was a comfortable place to stay and certainly not grimy or crappy in any way. Just a lot of smaller details and customer service issues that they could improve on. Let's hope they do!;3;12;5;8;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1882;4/30/2012;SEP9Y8fMHYC7bFLMLGCmJw;9Xzm8xvRotEW8c1Tf-uRPw;The Hotel is beautiful and the amenities are great so if you're looking for a trendy yet peaceful get away, the Dana Hotel is a decent option, much better when you consider the price and the comparables.  HOWEVER, DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU BOOK THROUGH A THIRD PARTY!!!!  I realize this is partially my fault for using Expedia and not the Dana Hotel directly, but I did not realize that the $700 I spent on three nights through Expedia would warrant the incredibly rude treatment I've received since check-in, and I haven't even been here for 24 hours yet.   First, there is absolutely nothing any of the staff will do when room is incorrect or you have other routine check-in issues.  Obviously--according to the demeanor of the girl I initially checked in with--people who prepay for their rooms and book through third parties are undeserving of quality customer service.  HOWEVER, if you're willing to take a downgrade (which I reluctantly agreed to) they will happily move you, but don't expect reimbursement for the difference in price.   In Dana's defense, most of my actual problems stemmed from booking through a third-party site (wrong room, no prior notification of 150 incidental).   My complaint about the Dana Hotel specifically is how rude the staff has been in response to the fact that I booked through a third party.  I understand how it might be preferable for hotels to have their guests book directly through them, but they still obviously gain something from allowing third party reservations, or they wouldn't allow them.  THEREFORE, I see no reason for the Hotel Customer service to treat me like a pile of dog shit, especially because this whole ordeal ended up costing me more than if I had just booked through Dana directly.  If you don't like Expedia, stop accepting third party reservations.  Otherwise, don't take it out on your guests.   Before I checked in, I was so excited to have a few days here (I live in Chicago but am staying here while in the process of moving).  I was glad to have found a place that was nice, relaxing, and reasonably priced so I can stop sending my friends and family to dingy Comfort-Inn type places when they come to visit.  But at least at dingy-Comfort Inn type places, you're likely to receive a welcoming smile upon check in, which is a lot more than I can say for the Dana.;2;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1883;8/22/2012;k7zmZQbU4fAhZ3-VzA4;Yhm3Fx40fOOIZVxD1NMYAA;I was a guest at Dana for two months while searching for a new home in the city. This places me in the unique position of seeing the entire ebb and tide of customers and the manner in which the team at Dana served them. The Quickie Review: AMAZING. Absolute Fabulocity. Danalicious. Book 'Em Dana. Wow. The Detailed Review: I'd like to start off by disclosing that I travel way too much for work. Like up to 100 nights a year in hotels much kinda much. I have stayed in hotels that are much  more expensive than Dana and ones much less expensive. So at the high-end of this spectrum we are talking Bellagio suite and at the low end Embassy Suites. (each a fine player in their market) Of ANY hotel I have ever visited, Dana is simply the best experience ever. Hands down. I have to admit that I read the less than favorable reviews first because I knew pretty much what the huge number of  the 4+ Star crowd reviews would say already.  Of the few negative reviews, I tossed out about 50% for the guest just being whiny or unrealistic. For example, one reviewer was a classic example of an all around 'all about me' classic bitch about her stroller issue. NEWSFLASH Princess: You are in River North...basically down freakin town Chicago. This ain't West Goatscrew, Nebraska. It's a stylish neighborhood in a densely populated urban area with a demographic that is largely single, trendy, well-dressed and still a size six. No matter the demographics, any idiot knows that this - and many other neighborhoods close to downtown - are totally stroller inappropriate. In fact, it was quite rude of you not only to bring one but to expect special treatment for using one. It ain't all about you. There. Wha??? Somebody had to say it. You know you wanted to. Yes, the elavators are slow on busy days and nights. A bit of a design flaw. But if it takes me an additional 5 minutes of my day to get to heaven then I'm still in heaven. Yea me. As for the elevator to the elevator design...oh good LAWD (have mercy) we're talking ONE FLOOR in a sparsely used glass box of bliss. Really honey..it adds like 2 minutes tops to your journey towards Valhalla. You can also use this brilliant invention called 'the staircase' which is even stylishly staggered just for your personal comfort. This adds about 15 seconds tops to your journey. Woo. You carried the thing for 9 months and now reject it for 2 minutes work? Way to go Mommy Dearest. The smart money is on Dana. For the prices, the professionalism of the staff, the thoughtful amenities provided and the kickass location. Perfection.  Honestly, you don't see this type of total package at this price level. Add 200 more per night and it's common. It's expected. At Dana, it's just another reason to fall in love with the subtle and not so subtle ways they work to make your visit special. There is a door to the bathroom:you ARE NOT exposed in the shower. If standing in front of the opening into the  bathroom, Look just to either side for some highly polished wood. Now touch the wood and SLIDE It either right or left to maintain bathroom privacy and reveal your closet and safe. The showers are to die for. Oh if mine could talk. (zip it!)  Thankfully what happened at Dana stays with the doorman. (TIP them people...they deserve it and are your best source of info in the city. And darn nice people too.) Staff is brilliant. Never had an issue. I've watched them when slow and when slammed. In every situation,  I witnessed polished professionalism and grace. Sure, there may be some moments that some visitors have where something went wrong. Every hotel has that reality. Dana just handles it better:I can almost guarantee that based on seeing them in action day to day. Rooms rock. Beds are like sleeping on a dreamy cloud made of porn. Wonderful. The day I moved to my new house I actually shed a tear in leaving Dana. I've even gone back for a weekend just to see my muse. 6 Months later she still remembered my name. Class act guys. I miss ya.;5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1884;3/5/2012;zPLHbiyg1I-xFaq4T1s8Lw;Bf0feidGvk-Q4wHdrUODrw;I celebrated my 30th birthday here and spent about $2,000 with the hotel. I booked a large suite, 6 appointments to in room spa service ($150 per service), Dinner at their restaurant aja for 12, and $1000 worth of bottle service at their club (Vertigo). Everything was totally mismanaged and disorganized. None of there services (spa, restaurant, hotel) communicate with each other. Nothing coordinated properly. However, most of the staff was friendly and they tried to be accommodating, but just could not figure it out. I forgave them for this. However, I could not forgive them for the following events: I had a small group of friends meet me at my suite around 9:30 on a Saturday night before bottle service at Vertigo. Our party was fairly conservative. Friends actually told me they thought the party was at a room across from mine, because they saw tons of people pile in and loud music. Given that at least three other rooms on my floor were raging, I figured my party was pretty tame. At about 10:45, just as we were about to go up to Vertigo, my friends decided to sing me Happy Birthday and make a toast to me. I was so touched, but I could not enjoy it because as soon as they finished two very irate and intimidating security men barged into my room and escorted me to the hallway. My boyfriend followed me out because he was concerned for my safety. The two men bullied him back in the room stating that they would physically remove him if he continued to follow me. One security man yelled at me for having people in the room while the other one stared at my body. I asked the security man to please stop yelling at me and that I planned to escort my guests to Vertigo where my $1000 table waited for me. All the while, I was being visually raped by the other security guy. So then after much embarrassment, I asked my guests to follow me to the lounge upstairs. Instead of getting the VIP treatment that Vertigo promised me, my guests were made to leave the hotel, go around to the other side in the cold and wait in line. I talked to the bouncer and told him I had bottle service. He refused to let me up to the club and refused to let my friends in. So, I bribed him with $40 to let me and my friends up to my $1000 table. He obliged me after the bribe. Once I got to my table, my waitress and hostess were actually really nice and accommodating. I had no problem tipping them an extra $100. However, the remainder of my late arriving guests were repeatedly harassed by the hotel management and security. Several of my male gay friends were forced to wait outside as women passed them to get in. After my really fun party at Vertigo I decided to go back to my room. The parties were raging hard  at other rooms on my floor. I just wanted to chill with a few of my close friends. We were sitting on the couch, eating, and talking. No music was playing nor were we talking loudly. In fact, we could hear the party going on next door from our room. 10 minutes later 3 aggressive security men barge into my room. They begin to yell at my guests and tell them to "get the f%#k out" of my room. The man whom I bribed with the $40 was the only nice one (I wonder why). Even though there were about 12 people in the room earlier for my spa service with no problems, the security guard commanded that only 4 people could be in the room. Shaken and crying by this point, I told my boyfriend that I just wanted to go home. He calmed me down and said we should just get some sleep. So, Dana Hotel basically ruined my 30th birthday and took all my money.;1;10;0;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1885;8/18/2011;Am;UmndpN8Dx_6Ot_FyyLMPew;I work as a third-party hotel vendor, so I get the privilege of staying in a lot of hotels in several cities. Most recently in Chicago, I stayed the Palomar, which was lovely, and the Best Western, which was atrocious. Trumping them both is the Dana, however. From the moment you arrive outside the door, you know you are in a great place. It's trendy and comfortable, that's smart. Doormen greet you immediately and show you to the concierge, which is a 1-2 person desk. Very humble: smart and casual, if you will. Keys are needed to ride the elevators, so as to avoid the squatters who just want to check out the visual delights of this boutique hotel - which definitely don't disappoint, mind you. Rooms feature hardwood floors and floor-to-ceiling windows offering a view of the city. They are modern and inviting. There are robes and slippers, a full work-station, complimentary wireless Internet, a television and big, comfy beds. Complimentary fitness center, a full-time business center, air travel kiosks, a chef-driven restaurant (free breakfast vouchers if you book direct with the hotel), and a swanky spa compile some of the fabulous extras. Don't forget one of the hottest, best-kept secrets: Vertigo, their sky lounge. Absolutely loved this place. Huge fan.;4;2;1;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1886;12/28/2011;N3IJc8wIW-TzZH1;L0uZ8Hzfs5jt0bt68MDu_g;We enjoyed a 3 night stay here early Dec 2011.  After some research on the River North hotels, I thought that Dana Hotel would be a good choice.  I was not disappointed! I found this hotel to be trendy, some highlights include full length windows that provided great views of the city (we had a corner room), a rainfall shower, iPod dock.  The hotel staff was super friendly and very eager to please during our stay.  The hotel was also centrally located to what we were doing and everything seemed walking distance.  In the winter months, we also enjoyed the fire on the rooftop lounge with blankets and robes provided for warmth.   The negatives are that during the Christmas season the rooftop lounge was not always avaiable to us.  Also, take note that while the beds are comfortable, the pillows are waaaaaayyyyyyyy too soft.  We did find a firmer pillow in the closet and I have no doubt the hotel staff would have provided firmer pillows, we didn't bother asking.;5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Being part of a bridal party, we booked a couple of rooms at the Dana Hotel this past weekend for the bachelorette party.  The hotel itself is very nice, clean and has a super friendly and knowledgeable staff and an extremely friendly and helpful doorman.  The one thing that I could have done without was seeing women who were no joke, in their 60s and 70s and dressed in what could have been found in their provocatively dressed granddaughters' closets. Aside from the wardrobe no-nos, the hotel rooms are very clean and the beds are super comfortable.  The only other odd thing was the shower--the inside of the shower was very spacious and had a waterfall faucet along with a handheld faucet, but instead of a wall, there was a huge piece of glass so the person showering could be seen from the bedroom side of the hotel room.  These rooms are definitely good for those who are looking to get a little frisky, but there is a curtain for those that like their privacy while showering. Overall, we had a great experience here and hopefully I'll be able to return someday!;4;1;1;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1889;5/26/2011;Amu9g5;uEOVL45MTwS44oJJLYGZOg;The Dana Hotel rooftop bar / lounge is a must! Posh, great looking crowd, solid tunes and a gorgeous outdoor terrace - this is THE place to see and be seen.

1890;7/14/2011;R9m8-kbZ3C-PJkcnHAvKsw;d-gKwMPUhU7bJDUKfp_Eiw;My significant other and I had a staycation this month and really enjoyed ourselves. Just one night away from the stressors of life with a comfy bed and a down comforter that I don't have to wash. Floor to ceiling windows overlooking the night city skyline, so gorg. Even my boyfriend approved of mini-bar purchases, he was having such a relaxing time. One complaint, they don't have HBO, so we settled on Showtime since the MMA fights were on and boyfriend loves that. Shower was amazing, staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend to anyone who is staying in the city for a weekend. You'll enjoy the trendy atmosphere which isn't snobbish.;4;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1891;4/7/2011;hlKvMNZRh0ORCZSDKnaouA;vXmX--CQkgStqInhvGnE4w;Do you feel vibe? Posh. No, not the Spice Girls. This swanky hotel felt like more of an apartment then a hotel... most of the time anyways. I mean except for the awesome shower, the chocolate covered fortune cookie from housekeeping, the welcome *insert name here* on the television upon checking in, and the breathtaking floor-to-ceiling windows it did feel like I was staying over at a friend's place that happened to live in the city. The room had a studio loft feel and I love the glass in the shower to help open the space up and connect the rooms more. Location is key. Dana has your key... maybe not to your heart but definitely to the heart of the city. The red line is 2 blocks away, yummy eats are all around, and Michigan Ave. is a short stroll down the street. The bar at the top of the building is really cozy and offers decent views of the city the best of which can be taken in at night. The big downfall is that the bar is closed to only hotel guests so you don't really get to talk to any locals and get to know the people that make the city what it is. Breakfast on the first floor however is a much different story. Awesome food to get your day going and on both days that we stayed got to talk to some really great people over morning coffee. I would have given 5 stars for the place alone but the people at the front desk just really irked me. They were the only people there that had a stick up their arse. Different shifts = different people with the same stick. I don't know what all their problems were but I didn't come across one friendly person working that position my whole stay. You are the frontline employee to the customer experience... act like it. *Overall Dana, if you were a person, I see you in stilettos. Like really fashionable ones but ones that you got on a super deal at DSW or something. You're that girl that is cool without trying and everyone hates you because they want to be you but they can't hate you because you're so likeable. Even with the horrible front desk staff, the rest of the people make up for their downfall. Very reasonably priced and very good location. Rating: 4;4;3;2;4;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1892;6/26/2011;RXORl-NzUACezsqtQiPUZg;qQ5NOCTQhVVfKHLTtC5kJg;Stayed here on a business trip and I have to say this one of the trendiest hotels I've stayed in.  This hotel is very comparable to the W Hotels , but more on the boutique side. I arrived around 10pm at night and was greeted by the friendly door man w/ dreads.  I was really hungry and he recommended me a couple of good places to eat throughout my stay.  He offered to help me with my luggage, despite me only having a carry-on.  Dana Hotel, if you're reading this, please recognize your doorman w/ dreads (or braids.. not sure!?!) As another reviewer was saying.. this place does have the sexiest shower ever!!!;5;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1893;4/6/2011;n;WGzzpPFj_-hnuBLdaQbLHA;My fiancee and I celebrated the night we were engaged with a stay at the Dana. The front desk guy kindly upgraded us to a corner king room with a city facing view. It was GORGEOUS! If I could wake up there every single morning for the rest of my life with that view--I'd die a happy lady! Back story, we're hotel snobs. Even in our home city, we've stayed in nearly all of the higher end hotels for "stay-cations." While the Dana has a great location and very nice rooms, it's only drawback is that it's starting to show a little bit of wear and tear around the edges. Little scuffs and nicks are easy to clean up by maintenance staff, but really go a long way to keeping the hotel looking "nice and new." I love the fact that they have little bags of goodies on the nightstand for mini bar treats. Most hotels offer the same stiff and boring goodies, pretzels...mix nuts...cookies...BLAH! Forget that! The Dana has gummy bears, chocolate covered dried fruit, chocolate covered cookies, toffee squares...you name it! YUM! The shower was also one of my favorite features, it's glass wall faces the bed. So, you can get a place to sleep and a show! HAH! Bed was super comfy and I love the decor. Dana...we might just see you again!;4;2;3;2;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

My best friend and I met at the Dana for a fun filled weekend to celebrate life. Instead of exchanging Christmas/Valentines gifts, we decided to take a girls trip and get a little rowdy. The Dana was perfect! We both got in on Friday but her train was delayed so I enjoyed the AMAZING view, AMAZING room, and OMG the shower! This hotel is quite possibly the sexiest place I have ever stayed. While we opted to keep it clean and not stare at each other in the nude, this would be the BEST place to go for a sexy love retreat with your favorite favorite. The 2 nights we were there were amazing. We had our first cocktail and amazing meal down at Aja and ended our vacay with a delicious breakfast at the hotel. The mini-bar was tempting late-night and even a great value but we didn't indulge. We loved our experience at the Dana so much that we have promised to return sometime in the summer to take advantage of the SPA and VERTIGO! *I'm knocking one star for a sometimes dirty/smelly elevator and a remote that didn't work but really...who is watching TV?*;4;3;3;2;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1896;2/13/2011;EVqaVmcLTxmEEQngP2MveA;lFc_RXY4lLpghA_ScbbAzA;This is my review for the SPA at Dana i came here recently for a massage with Katrina (i'm pretty sure that was her name) and a facial with .. can't remember.   The massage was AMAZING.  I had an 80 min swedish massage- but she used all techniques and really customized it towards my needs.  She was very friendly and talkative when I met her, but knew when to stop talking when the massage began (thank God! nothing worse than a masseuse talking too much)  i have a really bad back and she really used deep pressure on those areas and wasnt afraid to get in there and work it lol. the facial was reallly good too.. i got a customized 50 min facial with microdermabrasion.. it was my first time so the lady really educated me on everything.. she was talking a whole lot at first but i guess she kinda had to so i knew what was going on.. but then she let me relax so that was nice.  she gave a small massage on my neck and head-- it was really bad and pointless-- something she should work on-- no pressure at all... the Amenities SUCKED. a tiny little steam room in the locker room- seats 2 people.. and 2 showers... the relaxation lounge was a tiny room for 4-5 people to sit... no snacks... but the kiwi-strawberry water was good. all in all, if u really are in need of a good massage and dont care for amenities, then u should come see Katrina... but if u want amenities and basically stuff that you're paying for... go to a diff med spa..;3;1;1;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1897;3/5/2012;CheeZviqnvNtE1RrMYv-jA;KPjS9qvfX2ucNtFF--tZGw;Beds are comfy but our bathroom had a weird Amsterdam red light district vibe to it. Glass walls between the shower and the bedroom and the curtain was on the *bedroom* side. Kinda creepy. Also, avoid getting a room outside the elevator. The doors are paper thin.;3;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1898;7/27/2008;Njh0QRqCIm6L350QuEhOHg;om5ZiponkpRqUNa3pVPiRg;I haven't actually stayed here, but I spent so much time in my colleague's hotel room during her stay last week that I feel as if I stayed here... And I like this new modern looking hotel! The people who work here are super friendly. We were big fans of the concierge who didn't even blink when we asked him if he knew of any strip clubs that served lunch. The rooms are very spacious and I especially loved the hardwood floors and rain shower surrounded by glass doors on all sides (there is a curtain to shield yourself from peeping toms). Business travelers will also be thrilled to know the wifi is fast and free...and this hotel just happens to be located in a very convenient downtown location. If you get hungry Ajasteak is right downstairs and there's plenty of other good eats (quartino is always a winner) within a block of the hotel. My colleague found this room on http://quickbook.com for just over $200, which I thought was quite the deal for a quality hotel during summer in Chicago.  She seemed quite happy with her 3 nights in the hotel as well, her only complaint being that the walls were super thin so you can hear everything in the neighboring hotel rooms. I probably won't ever stay here since I live just minutes away, but I'll be recommending it to out of town visitors and may visit the inviting spa.;4;9;7;5;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1899;6/11/2009;sTy3gEZplHrPNY;3zxy3LVBV3ttxoYbY4rQ8A;I totally feel my colleagues' pain about the thin walls. Lucky for me, my experience wasn't too bad. And here's why. Ask for a corner room. When I made my reservations, I asked for my exact room I had during my last stay. I was on the 20-somethingth floor with great views and off to the corner--far from the elevator. Unfortch, they did me a solid during my last stay and gave me that room at our corporate rate (it's usually more for a corner room). I didn't have that option this time ... until I worked my charm, and the reservation specialist over the phone went ahead and gave me that corner room for the same rate. I love you Dana Hotel &amp:Spa. Nothing much changed from my last stay: it's still a challenge to get out of those marshmellow-ey, sleep-like-a-baby beds. The shower is heaven:bath products are spa-like ... Only change I noticed was the complimentary breakfast. It used to be laid out on the bar buffet-style, but now you have to go to the restaurant for a sit-down meal. You can still grab and go, but when you're in a hurry, it takes a bit longer. My only complaint is the loud AC. It rattles around when it shuts on and off ... and I do wish the rooms had a fans. When the air is on auto and blows for however long, the room is a nice crisp cold and lying under the covers in bliss. But as soon as it auto-powers off for a bit, the room gets HOT. A fan would keep that cool air circulating for the time being. Just a thought. Other than that, service is five stars:they have some of the friendliest doormen ever.;4;10;5;4;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1900;8/16/2011;LKpH0i5vrVY4NrlurL0cxg;9bLy4wY1JioaX9y19-3Ung;We stayed one night in the tranquil suite the night we got engaged. The room was fantastic--incredibly spacious, unique views of downtown, and a minimalist aesthetic that we enjoyed. The living area of the suite has a pretty large mini fridge, couch, and coffee table, so it was a nice spot to relax and have a bottle of wine before dinner. The bathroom was incredible--I am still dreaming about the double rain shower! I can't give this place 5 stars though for 2 reasons: 1) the bed was incredibly uncomfortable. I felt like we weren't even sleeping on a mattress, but rather a giant padded pillow. And not in a "it was so soft" kind of way. The bed was just incredibly unstructured--lumpy, sagging, not comfortable at all. It was bad enough that I wouldn't be willing to pay full price for a room here, and especially wouldn't be willing to stay more than one night. I'm not really picky about beds, but there was just something wrong with this one (my fiance agreed). I haven't noticed any other complaints about this though, was ours just defective?? 2) We didn't interact with the concierge much, but it seemed like the staff could be a bit absentee. I don't really care about luxury service or anything, but if you're the kind of person that does, I could envision this place not being attentive enough for you. Overall, a positive and memorable experience, but what was wrong with our bed??;4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1901;2/4/2012;J;eMzHKl2uLOuCsiNuNBcbhQ;Ignore the service whiners. We were treated like kings in every area: bell hops, front desk clerks (you get to sit down and relax as you are checking in), wait staff, concierge, bartenders....etc.  But that wasn't even the highlight....our room was freaking amazing (ask for room 1716).  Awesome corner room with spectacular views and ceiling to floor windows.  If you are a fan of contemporary boutique hotels, you will have a difficult time finding better options in Chicago.;5;2;1;2;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1902;8/1/2009;PFr2-JaN4nG8zbbTSJrviA;G0FGeAGBj7IUFgCidXaSqg;I've stayed here two times. The first time, I was extremely impressed with the hotel for the price. It's boutique-y in feel and they have a nice rain shower in the bathroom that has floor to ceiling glass that overlooks the sleeping and lounge area. The bed has plenty of pillows and is quite comfortable. The rooms are equipped with flat screens, and they have nice bath products. During my first trip, I was consistently having to have my key re-magnetized. Apparently cell phones and credit cards cause the key to malfunction. Unless I was wearing pants with pockets, and I could store the key separately in my pocket, there ws about a 60 percent chance that I'd have issues with it. The second time, I still happy with my stay, but the key issue really began to wear on me. If I weren't going in and out of my room more than once a day, maybe this wouldn't have pissed me off. About every 3 times I had to get my key re-magnetized. And I wasn't alone. Seemed to be quite a trend here. The worst was when you were in the elevator with a bunch of people who keyed the elevator so you could push your floor button, only to realize that your room key didn't work once again when you reach your room. On weekends, it's also a pain in the ass because the elevator is shared with the rooftop lounge and there are loads of drunk people you have to ride with, some who like to push all the buttons "for fun". (are we three?) The service is friendly and accomodating, the rooms nice, but the keys suckkkkkkk. And Friday night elevator riding does too.;3;6;2;4;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1903;11/8/2008;v8P0eLwLNq;um-78ffjtSyezySmMC0fLg;*This review is for the downstairs bar at the Dana Hotel A friend suggested we head to the Dana Hotel for drinks after dinner.  The bar area was small but we were able to snag a seat by window. This isn't a place I would hang out normally but I did like it because: 1) It had great people watching from some dude that looked like a professional wrestler with his ultra-blonde girlfriend to cute foreign guys (several were French), to some guy that got out of a Bentley convertible.  Also, there were several drop dead gorgeous black women working here. 2) The drinks were STRONG. Like scrunch up your face and make a noise strong. If you're gonna pay $10+ for a drink in my book, it better be strong. Sangria was tasty. 3) I dug the décor. We checked out the upstairs/hotel check-in area. It was cool-swanky. After this experience I wouldn't mind trying out their upstairs bar, Vertigo, for a special night out.;4;4;3;2;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1904;10/14/2009;rKB00aX1I0pgPpRIn3fRVQ;t1f1ynMSjuSpqUhc14Cv-Q;Let me start by saying that I wish I would have reviewed this place the two times I've been there for drinks before because they would have been 4 star experiences.  But last night was ridiculous!  Inexcusable! It was 7 PM on a Tuesday night.  My friend and I met there after work,. We sat in the comfy chairs like we always do and 2 other people were sitting at the bar. We waited 25 minutes and no one acknowledged our existence. We tried to catch someone's eye.  Servers walked back and forth, the  bartender mindlessly wiped the bar and started into space.   And for the prices they charge I should not have to flag down a waiter and beg him to get me a drink. "Excuse me, sir? Can you please get me an overpriced drink. Pretty please? I'll be your best friend."  Um, no way. You should be Johnny on the freakin' spot at an upscale hotel. Especially with a whopping 4 PEOPLE to serve. Not that it matters probably, but my friend and I were dressed appropriately.  Jeans and a cute top.   After 30 min. of waiting.  We walked over to Bijan's across the street.  The waitress remembered me as I used to go there for lunch quite a bit last year.  The drinks, food, and service were fantastic, as always. After I finish this review, I am going to write a STELLAR review for Bijan's.   Dana... you have a lot of making up to do.;1;4;2;2;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

I decided to take my cousin and a friend from out of state for a little R&R as a bridal gift...A massage was my mission. The prices are unbelievable! A 50 minute massage for $90.00 in a "Spa" like atmosphere. This wasn't a place with a room and you're in and out. We felt like queens for a few hours. We had comfy slippers, fluffy robes, a great steam before and after the massage. The most relaxing "Relaxation Room" with calming music and water. Even shampoo and blow-dyers to get all pretty afterwards. The best part: we bought online gift certificates for $100.00 and got $25.00 Free! So actually 3 massages was only $78.00 each. Even Better!!! You can get the certificates on their web site. Now, details of the most amazing massage. First off, the Bed was heated. Nothing better than that in my opinion. My therapist was amazing. She hit all the right spots, massaged my hand and head too. After each body part was massaged, she would lay hot towels on my skin!! I was in HEAVEN. I've been to the the four seasons and top end spas, but had a hefty price tag and paid $150.00 per massage..Now, I have the secret. Great Deal, Great Spa and Relaxed all for $90 plus tip!;5;2;1;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1908;2/19/2010;0wtXsAg8qE4sasniO0yLng;XDXzvxPXv7L2c58BFnbsEg;I stayed at Dana for Valentines Day and loved it. I'm definitely going to make excuses to go back. The hotel is very romantic and modern. Beautiful views, comfortable beds, even the blow dryer was the best. We stayed in a standard king. The shower was my favorite thing about the room - having the option to see in to the room (or for someone to see you in the shower) was sexy.  Having an amazing restaurant in the hotel and lounge on the top floor was very convenient. We received breakfast with the room and it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had with complimentary Bloody Marys. The only thing is, you may want to close your shades. I think the residents who live in the condos across the street could write a book on what they see. Floor to ceilings for them and for the hotel rooms probably makes for some funny stories. As I was in bed watching TV I looked over and saw the guy across the street doing the same thing plus a glare in his windows showing the guy in the hotel room under me walking around in his tighty whities. I wouldn't penalize the hotel for that though, if it makes you uncomfortable you have great dark shades - I thought it was still dark out when I woke up. Very nice.;5;2;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1912;8/23/2010;6x7caUuhsCLohf6adC4i8A;xHtWDV4zEp-lXYeGqRAkLw;This was the first rooftop bar in Chicago that I've been to. I don't know much about the hotel and spa itself. Actually, I don't know anything about it. but this is probably the last time I'll go to this rooftop bar. I enjoy rooftop bars/lounges (especially in the summer\spring time). The Dana Hotel was really nice. It was half open to the outside and half indoors. It was nice. They had heaters for the winter, I supposed. The music was pumping, nice size crowd, there is some dancing and grinding involved (not trashy at all). Some of my girlfriends and I went to meet up some of our other friends here. I've been to settings like this before (stylish yuppies, douchebag "bros", rich pretentious old men looking for younger girls, ladies who are waiting by the bar looking hot slash slutty so they could find some pretentious old man to pay for their overpriced, skinny tall glass with a ton of ice and straight up alcohol drink, etc.) You just have to go there with a mentality that everyone's there to get wasted (as did I) and then judge everybody else. It's easier for ladies to get in than guys, unless you're popular and/or rich. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time there with my friends, but the place was too poshy, too stuck up, and wasn't my cup of tea. I'd go back if people asked me to, but I would never suggest going there to have fun. It's a good place to take your visitors, if they like to go to places like that.;3;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

I couldn't figure out how to turn up the air conditioning for the life of me. The floor to ceiling windows got a bit annoying at times b/c at every angle there are facing buildings that can catch a glimpse of everything you do. *Ahem* like changing. Having to use a room key to use the elevator was quite frustrating at times. Imagine going up and down the elevator a few times cuz' your key isn't being recognized. Anyway, on to the good.

1916;5/5/2009;B0Y3gIQEz;e7VaynYAaTxTWiR6pHduLA;So I had high hopes for this hotel, and am only giving it three stars because I paid full price for a tiny room, and they couldn't switch it because the hotel was full. I didn't bother to ask for another room the other three nights I was staying there because I didn't want to pack up my things just to unpack them again. The most irritating things was having to use my room key to GO UP and DOWN the elevator. YUP, in case of emergency, don't use the elevator, because it won't go anywhere without a room key. This was always the talk on the elevator with someone, and an annoyance during my stay there. The location is good, very close to two Starbucks and one block away from Whole Foods. The staff is great, always good-looking, friendly and helpful. I didn't experience much noise, but that was probably because my room was on the end of the hall. Overall I couldn't sink into feeling comfortable  here. Maybe it was something about the overly-mod decor, the layout of the lobby, or the concrete ceilings. I did enjoy using the ipod doc/player a lot. I would recommend it to people who are night owls, want to party,, meet other singles, and who don't mind keying up and down the elevator.;3;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1917;5/19/2010;D;-r7gJoqV1uaHHOoHkhUGrQ;My boyfriend and I spent this past weekend at the Dana hotel and had the most fabulous time ever! He flew in from Ohio and I flew in from California, and this was my first time visiting chicago, so it was important that we got a little taste of everything. Terrific location first of all, within walking distance of shopping, restaurants/bars. Loved the fashionable, modern vibe the hotel had going on. Room was very clean, beds were sooo comfortable and the shower was huge! Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to check out the spa. Drew, the bartender at the main lobby bar kept us coming back every night! He had an awesome personality, kept us entertained at the bar, hooked us up with some amazing drinks, and recommended some great places for us to go out and to eat! Rooftop bar was nice as well, very cool concept and great views, more of a relaxed setting as well. The bellman, Caesar was also of great help to us from the minute we arrived at the hotel by assisting us with our luggage to providing us with directions every time we needed to get somewhere! Overall, the service at Dana was great, and the hotel was just what we were looking for! :);5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1918;6/4/2009;Qs7RMRn8uPsFDVkAqtUNxQ;0zRLjgw0PQUwqiUCOIgShQ;Ah, Dana Hotel, home sweet home for a few days. Overall, I'm most certainly a fan, but with a few caveats or odd design things that I wish someone had thought about (maybe they did?) in the design of the rooms. Pluses: + Clean and modern decor that still didn't feel sterile or cold. + Turn-down service with chocolate-covered fortune cookies (...and they filled my ice bucket, too?!  Is that normal or did someone think I was going to have a party in my room?!) + Big comfy beds with smooshy comforters + Cool iPod docking stations with pretty great quality speakers + Flat-screen TVs with non-confusing remotes + Exceedingly friendly and helpful staff + A nice hotel bar on the ground floor + 24 hr room service was available if you needed it (though there is a 7-11 located across the street if you are looking for cheaper late-night snacks). +Free wifi +Mini-business center with 2 computers and a printer +Great towels!  I don't know why this should be such a big deal, but it IS.  sometimes even the nicest hotel have those super-scratchy small-ish towels.  These were bath-sheet size and so soft you wanted to nuzzle 'em. Minuses/Funny things: - No matter how many hotels do this, I still find it slightly jarring to check in on the 2nd floor -- although the 2 elevator system was a little wacky, that probably does help narrow down on the confusion, though... - The rainwater shower was cool, but it was also.... literally, cool. Because there's no way to close off the shower from the rest of the bathroom (there's just a partial class divider), it can feel a lil' drafty -The walls seem pretty thin. The funny part is that one of the loudest recurrent noises you might notice is that of the neighbor's curtains going up or down.  Considering that the walls are all glass, this is bound to happen pretty often! Also...ask for a room way from the elevator, for sure. Otherwise, you may be hearing lots of "ding, ding, ding" while trying to sleep. - Because of the walls of glass and the way the shower and bathroom are set up, you'll need to close at least one set of curtains before showering or using the bathroom. It's a little odd to think that if someone didn't notice that, they would immediately be exposing themself in multiple vulnerable states. I didn't get to visit the upstairs bar/lounge, but wish I'd had a chance. I also would have liked to try a spa service or two but alas, I'm trying to save a little money.   Considering my overall experience, I'd be happy to stay here again next time I'm in Chicago (and not staying with friends or family) and hopefully check it out, along with a massage, perhaps!;4;8;5;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1919;1/12/2009;ff9EwvTA-De7vU0xHWicmg;igaoaFNkX7ieMuyUBg0u5w;We were instantaneously greeted the moment we walked in and went up the elevator to get to the hotel reception area, where we met a very friendly Romeo who told us much about the hotel.  I love how environmentally constructed the place is!  The modern decor is warm yet modern.  The interiors makes me feel like I'm at my friend's really nice condo.  The room offers bathrobes and slippers.  They also carry exfoliating body soap.  They have a simple fitness center with very nice machines.  The spa tiles are supposedly made out of glass pop bottles.  It looks gorgeous.  Also, Housekeeping was also really nice.  My friend and I felt like we were on vacation, and I live only 10 minutes away!;5;4;4;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1920;6/14/2009;P4D;yaBIVHDxaUBN2YHQ8-YiuQ;So I got pretty lucky and won a Time Out weekly prize - I got a free night at the Dana, and a free "couple's spa package" for my boyfriend and myself! The concierge was extremely friendly and accommodating.  For some reason, when I had selected my room type, I had chosen a room with two double beds even though I was staying with my boyfriend.  it was a lapse in judgment.  Fortunately, the woman at the desk noticed and was like "Why would a couple have a room with two double beds?" and updated us to a corner king room!  She really was interested in making our stay the best it could be, and that did not go unnoticed. I thought the room was beautiful.  The bed was cozy and overflowing with pillows.  Two walls were made entirely of windows, but the shades that pull down are very effective at blocking early-morning sunshine.  It was nice to have a view down State Street.  I don't think the people on the ground can see us up on the 6th floor, but I felt a bit weird changing my clothes in full, broad daylight next to a window, but nobody seemed to look up.  Hopefully! The bathroom was pretty awesome as well - the one downside was the sliding door.  Lots of boutique hotels seem to have these, and I hate them.  they don't block sound, and you just feel like whoever you're sharing the room with can hear all your business.  Uncool.  Also our sliding door had some trouble staying shut, which made it even worse....  BUT I loved the shower!  It was like being in a rain forest!  Once we figured out how to work out, it was divine - one of the shower heads is directly overhead so it pours down on you like rain, and the other has a detachable head and strong water pressure.  There was no shower curtain or door, which was kinda weird, but also kind of hot.  It gives you a direct view of yourself (and your shower buddy, if you have one) in the mirror, so shy people may feel a bit awkward.  I loved it.  It was very luxurious. The one weird thing about the room was that the ceiling and one pillar looked sort of....unfinished.  They were just that gray stone/cement color, with what looked like water spots and paint splatters.  It looked like somebody forgot to finish painting the room.  If it was meant to be part of the aesthetic, it was lost on me.  However, when we turned the lights off, the light coming from the street peeked through the cracks in the window shades, and made this amazing light pattern on the ceiling.  I can't tell if it was intentional or not, but it was pretty lovely.  There were lots of other nice things about the room - the huge mirror, the modern coffeemaker, and the general decor were all nice touches. Morning room service was prompt - the price is what you'd expect, but the food was surprisingly tasty.  For some reason, the room service menu in our room was apparently "outdated," so the items we ordered were no longer on the breakfast menu.  Still, the guy on the phone told us to describe the items and the kitchen would be happy to make them anyway.  I dig that. We also spent several hours at the spa getting our couple's package!  Massages were first, and they were great.  The couples massage entailed my boyfriend and I lying in separate beds while two women worked on us.  The room was dim, and there were candles and soft music.  The women were professional and talented - I'd recommend it to anybody who doesn't mind letting another woman put her hands on their man.  Ha.  Facials were next - I'd only had one before in my life, so I don't have much to judge it against.  It felt good - the bed was heated and the woman explained everything to me as she went along.  She gave me some advice on how to better care for my skin - and I know I don't do much for it, so I needed the help. She did some extractions using her hands, which surprised me, but I didn't mind.  As long as it works!  My skin did feel soft and glowing afterwards, maybe now I'll start taking better care of it to keep it that way.  The mani/pedi was next.  I loved the woman who did it - her name was Joyce - but the setting was odd.  She didn't really have her own room - just a little back area in a corridor behind the spa desk.  It was a little cramped, and it wasn't really a room, so we could hear all the chatter up at the spa desk the whole time.  The nail polish selection was good colorwise, but I think it was cheap polish - I prefer something like OPI for this kind of thing.  Regardless, Joyce was lovely and totally hilarious.  She moved back and forth between my boyfriend and I, and we really enjoyed her personality.  I have certainly had more luxurious mani/pedis in my life, but she still did a very nice job.  I think she could've done more with sloughing off dry skin - this was my first pedi since winter ended and I wanted some more intensive work!  The other nice thing was the "relaxation room" they put us in between treatments.  It's dim and quiet, with ice water to drink and lots of soft chairs and daybeds to lounge on.;4;2;2;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1921;8/4/2010;v7kgVczSgAakBkshFQ0kDg;3CCCOFUm1eZET-g17qd7wg;Let me start with a little info:  I've stayed in several Chicago hotels, and this is BY FAR the only hotel where I've actually enjoyed coming back to the room.  This was my 10th wedding anniversary, and I Yelp-stalked several hotels looking for spots that were not just template rooms.  Also, we didn't try the Spa service on this trip. LOCATION: Very nicely situated:the walk to Michigan Ave was drama-less, as was a quick 15-minute jaunt to Morton's off Wacker, and we also had a need to take the El from Northwestern University (Davis Station) to the Chicago Station, and the Dana is wonderfully placed right between that and the Grand Station, 2-3 blocks in either direction. I felt like everything that was important was no more than a 15-minute walk away (except Navy Pier, which was a $8 cab ride because of "Transformers 3" movie set road closures....grrr). STAFF: Courteous and professional throughout the stay. Some places you come across apathetic housekeeping, or the front-desk person who's so busy telling a bar story to the other front-desk person that they jack up your reservation, but the Dana staff was extremely attentive. The Concierge was excellent:he didn't just give us the "take a cab here and get outta my face" directions, he took the time to offer alternate routes and transportation methods. ROOM: As soon as I opened the door my jaw hit the ground...and bumped into my wife's jaw.....the views are INCREDIBLE. We had a "Corner King" on the 20th floor, which gave us a King bed with two entire walls made of floor-to-ceiling windows. Truly a difference maker, I thoroughly enjoyed the view.  The shower was pretty-good, I like the overhead rain-shower thingy, and the bathroom itself was styled well with good ergonomics for the most part. ATTACHED RESTAURANT & PARTY JOINT: The Dana provided us with two $10 breakfast vouchers for the "Aja" restaurant on the ground floor, which was cool, but you'd be better-served by walking the few blocks to "Yolk" for breakfast (FIVE STARS for Yolk, by the way....). We didn't have dinner at "Aja".  There's a pre-party, or lounge bar, or whatever type place on the roof, I forgot the name, but my wife and I tried it one night for a few minutes and we just weren't feeling the atmosphere. Could be that we're fuddy-duddies, but with the deck being closed at that time the only thing to do was drink and listen to somebody's half-assed attempt at techno. GRIPES: Other than "Aja" and the lounge, the gripes are very minor. Of course, with the great view out...comes a great view in. There's an apartment building directly across the street and there were a few awkward moments where my eyes met the tenants in a few apartments, but if you don't have a problem being "seen", it's not a biggie, just be aware. Also, there were 7 windows...which means there are 7 blackout shades AND 7 separate occluded shades. The most tiresome part was coming back to the room and finding that ALL of the shades had been let down as part of the turn-down service. Minor irritant, but again, just be ready to work to get a night view. The shower has a glass wall where a person in the room can see in the shower...and directly through the shower to someone on the crapper. There's a curtain, but it's on the room side. Made for "hilarious" moments for my wife while I was in my "Thinker" position. Last minor irritant, the shower doesn't have a door, it has a glass half-partition, so if you're a sloppy shower-er, count on having a wet bathroom floor. Almost forgot about the elevators: There's two of them:one from the ground floor to the check-in lobby (one floor up....), and a completely separate elevator from the check-in lobby to the rooms. The chafing part of this is that the room elevator actually DOES go to the ground floor, but it appears to be used only for vetting the crowd for the lounge. Yet another strike against the lounge....lol....it's no big deal though, I'm just nit-picking at this point..... That's it until my next visit, because I will definitely be staying there again. This is a well placed hotel with a twist and a great staff, and I really liked it.;4;1;1;1;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1922;8/5/2008;7iP3bW0PqPuKlLW2zdleGg;6nKq-WX6U0bg4iyVtdMrrQ;okay. its a nice hotel. brand new, really. and i love the natural earthy-ness atmosphere... but i paid WAY too much money to stay here. watch out for the 'cozy king' room... i either got the crappiest room in the hotel or they are all this tiny.  i have never been in a SMALLER hotel room in my life. ive stayed in hampton inn's with bigger rooms! the balcony they advertise (which sounded so freakin cool) was about a good 3 feet wide and not as fun as it initially sounded. also, my room had NO WINDOWS except for the window of the 'patio' door.  heeeyyy clausterphobia.  the shower was nice, but also cramped. with a little plastic toadstool for a seat. not sure who would venture sitting on it?  ew.   the bed was really comfortable but when they place you next to the staff stairwell and housekeeping room, you're not gonna sleep anyways. GUH! the place was virtually spotless clean and the bellstaff/valet were out of this world nice.  but my bill came to nearly $350 and i feel 100% cheated.   p.s. room service isnt worth it.  my breakfast and dinner were very odd tasting. almost tasted straight up like cafeteria food. you're better off venturing over to the whole foods for some food. the other star, the location is WONDERFUL to so many things. sorry, dana.  maybe next time you can give me a decent room and i wont have to be so mean to you.;3;1;1;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1923;8/1/2011;t5mH6P0GiUJV6i8l3u;09rg04Lryo_0M4gMC0Wiaw;Checked in at night during a driving rainstorm.  Staff member was providing umbrella assistance to guests arriving...except us.  He stood inside the door and waited for us to get drenched on our way in then said "lobby is upstairs."  Front desk receptionist was a jerk as well.  The door to our balcony did not work and our TV was broken...staff sent someone up who did nothing to resolve either.  Didn't think the rooms were that special aside from the problems.  Overrated hotel, the club makes for a very busy/crowded environment on weekends, would not recommend.;1;1;1;4;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1924;4/18/2010;PzMtPuQ76QVvCv9uBhgO4w;fRIS3H-HltbktixjkFO2xQ;Wow... suite's with windows floor to ceiling.. Really nice and big rain showers.. Rooms in the suite felt modern, but still comfortable and intimate.. Pretty impressive place..;4;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1925;1/3/2010;q5SCapDisUdgJS6x70CL6g;REwTpmdBFaYKRDgt-kqrwg;My honey took me here for a romantic staycation weekend for my birthday.  I had no idea we were going there and hadn't heard too much about the hotel so had no expectations.  I did however read a few yelp reviews while we were there watching our romantic weekend go down the tubes because of horrible service, incredible noise, and snotty, huffy hotel staff. So I'll start with arrival - everything went fine, we get to the room and at first are ohhhing and ahhing over the very cool looking shower.  But after taking a shower, the coolness factor wears off - serious open door design flaw. So not too much of a big deal, but worth noting.  Then we went for drinks in their super swanky rooftop lounge.  That was fun (although crazy overpriced) but I guess what do you expect from a downtown hotel.  The appetizers we had were decent and the service was a little slow. Also, you couldn't get to the rooftop lounge unless you went back downstairs and had someone swipe a card to get you up there.  This seemed kind of ridiculous to me - I had a room key, that should work as well.  We go out to dinner, get back to the room and when we're trying to go to sleep the noise from the rooftop bar is unimaginably loud. I can pretty much sleep though anything but this was out of control.  So we called the front desk to see if we could be transferred to another room (even though we were exhausted and already in bed). The woman on the phone was completely rude and unaccomidating.  She said the rooms were completely booked (really? In a recession on an off weekend right before a holiday?) and there was nothing she could do.  She did say she would "send somebody up." So we stayed awake waiting to speak with this person she was sending up and they never showed.  We called again.  Same woman said that she sent security up to our floor to walk the hallways and see if this was noise.  Since they didn't hear anything (in the hallway) then she said there was no problem with noise.  I asked if there was anything she could do, that we couldn't sleep and she said she could send up a fan or earplugs. (which then took 30 mins to get to our room and didn't help much.) The next morning after a crappy nights sleep (oh and there were multiple holes in the sheets) we ventured downstairs for breakfast. We wouldn't have even eaten there (read the reviews before hand that indicated the service was TERRIBLE and the food mediocre) but we had vouchers. We get to the restaurant and decide to sit at the bar because we thought we'd have a better chance at getting better service. I think that was a good call and while we were waiting for our food we got to see how frantic, disorganized and unprofessional the management and some of the waitstaff were who were trying to get drinks to their table.  Food came out - utterly unforgettable, greasy, and not worth even using the voucher.   Finally we go to leave and as we're checking out the manager just tells us we're all set after we turn in the keys (they didn't even ask how our stay was.) So I pipe up and give him an earful in a respectful way but in front of many other guests. he kind of half apologizes and then says he'll follow up in the next 24 hours by calling me to get more information and see if there's anything more they can do. It's now been 2 months and no call ever came.   Do yourself a favor, if you are going to stay at a nice hotel in Chicago, skip the Dana.;1;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1926;2/5/2010;VvkmFYR6dZ09TlBQXmHBkA;O0-C_HtiAMqyzl4mcUhQPA;1) Great location. A couple of blocks from the El and surrounded by restaurants and bars.  Walking distance to Rush St. and Michigan Ave. 2) Great rooms. Flat screen TV, iPod docking station, and lots of space. Loved the big shower, but the only concern might be the floor to ceiling windows looking across the way into an apartment building. Also, the see through shower to the toilet is definitely for the adventurous. 3) Most of the staff was great.....friendly, helpful, and curteous.  Only one douche works there, and unfortunately he was working the front desk on my visit. If I had avoided the foreign guy during check in I would have given 5 stars.;4;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1927;4/30/2010;ACNOpvLnaQ9y6k500tclFQ;gNuwpyT9iwL2Np6AUlTaUQ;This is a very chic and unique hotel. There are definite pros and cons. Pros: if you book through the hotel you get breakfast vouchers and even if you find a better deal on any online site they will match the price and maybe even upgrade your room. The restaurant had a very good breakfast menu, everything we got tasted great! We got a comfy King room corner view. It is amazing! The ceiling to floor windows are very unique. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings with the adjacent buildings. Keeping your shades up or down when needed. You'll have a great night view too. The floors are  half wood and carpet which gives it a homey feel. Shower is awesome! Very chic room overall. All the staff are very attentive and friendly. The concierge helped me surprise my husband with chocolate covered strawberries and a nice bottle of champagne delivered to our room for his birthday. Cons: you hear sirens all day and night!! If you're a light sleeper this is quite annoying. But I guess that's what you get visiting a big city. It's definitely worse than NYC. The walls are a little thin of the room but not bad. Over all I was very impressed with the hotel itself, we will definitely return!!;5;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1928;8/18/2010;2605xxsiGmLs8Or;7TfVV64bpESXSalEuVQurw;I'm going to keep this brief, yeah right. The good: they allowed us to check-in early without waiting (we got in around 11am). The doorman was awesome. Basically, this place was pretty cool as long as you didn't go inside. The bad: THE SPA. Let me go ahead and go into detail about their spa... upon check in, the fiance and I perused their spa menu, and after deciding on a couples massage (with two separate techniques) I gave the spa a call. It was a Friday, so when the receptionist told me their were no 80 minute couple slots left, it wasn't a surprise. Besides, they rave about their spa so it was sort of expected. Naturally, I asked about 80 minute slots for the next day and the employee told me they had an opening, so I took it. Fast forward to the appointment... the floor in the ladies locker-room was slippery so I fell walking out. And slipped walking back in (needless to say I couldn't walk the next day... now I wish I would have filed a complaint). Our appt was for something like 1pm, so we got their early to fill out paperwork and when 1pm rolled around we were taken to the small "relaxation room." 1:10 rolls around and two girls get us for our massages. Mind you, no one up until this point has asked us what style of massage we were receiving... we got what they wanted to give. The massage was good, a little disappointing considering I had asked for the "dana's aromasoul massages" and what I got instead felt like a sports rub. Well then 40 minutes came up and the girls said their goodbyes. I knew it was too fast for 80 minutes so we asked the front desk and they told us it was a 50 minute massage. Sure, a 50 minute massage and that is why we are sitting in the lobby, DRESSED, talking to you about it and it isn't even 2PM! I was fit to be tied (and massaged a little longer too) but we went to our room and I called the spa back. Finally a manager got on the line, told me they weren't ANY 80 minute slots available when I made my appt the day before and then offered to refund 15%. I told him, first off: apologize. When I call to book an 80 minute couples massage and there are only 50 min slots available: TELL ME. Don't be a retard and book me... that is BS. Second of all: don't insult me with a refund of 15%. Fool. I paid for services rendered. If you are going to go the lame-refund route, refund 100%. In the end, they left a bag of trial skin products on my door knob with $28 with a note saying: 15% refund. FAIL. Now onto the rest of the bad: the staff working in the restaurant "area" are completely and utterly confused. We asked where the hostess stand was.. the reply "um, just stand right here." Another time we asked the sushi bar if they were serving (at the sushi bar), they said yes. We sit down and 3 minutes later they tell us the sushi bar is closed but we can order sushi from downstairs. So, we sit at a table (this is on that same Saturday before the awesome spa debacle) downstairs and ask for the sushi menu. "No, we don't serve sushi, only brunch." Okay, well homeboy 10 steps up said you did. So Mr. Server goes upstairs and comes back no later then 10 minutes and says they can do it. Ordered an iced tea and the guy told me the bartender had to make it. HA!  This place is unreal! That Saturday night there were people screaming until 7am and you could hear them on the 8th floor. No joke. I slept with a pillow over my head which brings me to the next part... We stayed in the "Tranquil suite" and it was no where near tranquil considering the maids closet was adjacent to it. SO fail. We brought it to the attention of the employee at the front desk upon checking out and all he said was "oh yeah, I've heard that before." Seriously? Oh yeah, their iron ruined a recently purchased shirt... lol, I really don't know how I didn't go apeshit on these people. There were random hoodlums in the elevators waiting for someone with a card to get in. As a girl, this made me feel miles away from safe. Especially when it is later in the evening and I happen to be by myself. We reserved via the website and the site decided it wanted to upgrade our room (after the online checkout) to a MUCH more expensive suite (almost 1k more), so we had issues getting things right a month before we made it to Chicago. This place is so awesome. /sarcasm;1;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1929;12/20/2010;AoACnSPsHubflq7ZGy7dmA;Do2RwyvwZf17rudqgxq0Gw;Worst hotel experience EVER!!! Rooms were small yet cozy, however, the staff could use a lesson or two on manners,decency and customer service. When I called to speak with a manager and explained my issues, he flat out told me I'm not the first one to make a complaint like this and about a specific "security" employee who has treated other guests similar...yet they still allow this behavior. Very poor management. I highly recommend staying at one of the more larger established hotels instead of The Dana. It definately was NOT worth the money that was spend to be treated so ignorantly. It was my first experience there and will absolutely be my last. If you plan on booking a room at The Dana, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The city has plenty of other great hotels who treat their guests with respect. I'm extremely disappointed.;1;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

Late check out, check. A doorman, TJ who was on top of everything and didn't hesitate to give me the perfect recommendation. The Dana was great. Room size was perfect, bathroom perfect - okay a door in the shower would be nice but that doesn't seem to be the current fashion. Mini bar reasonably priced but there is a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Walgreens within two blocks. Free wired and wireless high speed internet. Great locations, everything is close by. Perfect is all I can say - but you still aren't getting 5 stars. :D;4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1933;10/30/2011;87OlrwzUQk9lZkuUVnbqew;I2DkgLFckrPBWIR7SGpZDw;The standard rooms are small but make efficient use of space.  The modern decor compliments the hotel's modern design and materials.  Despite much glass, cement, and metal, it still feels very intimate and warm.  However, if you are easily awakened, bring some sort of white-noise device, as we were constantly disturbed by car alarms and sirens a full 20 stories below.  My only complaint was the bellman tried scaring me into using the hotel's overnight valet service for $38 by saying I'd be towed if I parked overnight on Erie Street.  Minutes later, I asked a parking enforcement officer, who informed me that overnight parking was legal and free, but that I'd need to begin paying again at 8:00 a.m.   Despite that, I'd definitely go back.  The location is great, and the hotel is very unique.;4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1935;7/17/2010;yVb2Fo8LcfGu5oIbcMNGJQ;KQ6nCmC0T6TIepKLxrNdMg;1st time @ The Dana, and my wife and I really enjoyed our stay. Good location and cool vibe make it a great spot. Love the room. Comfy bed. Great shower!! Nice amenities. Only issue we had with hotel was the elevator. They apparently don't have service elevators so there's a lot of traffic on the lifts which makes for some longer wait. Also would have appreciated a pool.;4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1936;2/15/2010;g7RpYT9xRyGPX8;_Z26akmA0QbbUKBCt-cLuQ;We booked a tranquil suite at the Dana for 3 nights last week for our 9 year anniversary and were very pleased.  The room itself was amazing, on the 21st floor, with 2 separate balconies showcasing 2 different views.  The shower was unlike anything I'd ever seen, with the beautiful tile and slate floors, and the incredible rain shower heads.  The lighting in the bathroom was also amazing and I really appreciated the magnified handheld mirror.  The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby.  Also the round chair in the "living room" was so comfortable that I wanted to take it home! We got a couple's harmony massage in the spa, and they were very nice.  Different than other massages we'd had, but still relaxing.  Our  massage therapists Cat and Nicole were very skilled. We had dinner at Aja and Ami, our waiter,  was very accomodating.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  In fact, all of the food, including everything in the honor bar (wine, beer, water, soda, snacks) was very reasonably priced.  They provided us with $15 breakfast coupons for each day, but we never got out of the comfy bed in time to partake.  However, we did order breakfast from the room service menu and the food was very good and also reasonably priced. We went to the bar at Aja all 3 nights and each night our bartenders were very friendly and kept the conversation flowing. Being tattoo collectors, we appreciated the fact that most every staff member in the bar/restaurant had tattoos and we were even told by one bartender that we "fit in well" :-)  since we sometimes get sideways glances for our lifestyle choices.   We did venture up to Vertigo, just to see the view, but the whole "night club" mentality is not our scene so we didn't stick around.   I give the Dana 5 stars for service and friendliness, but do have to note a few cons on our visit, and these are things that I addressed with the sales marketer (when he asked us) and the concierge: *  the towels are not very soft.   For the price of the room, I expected soft, luxurious towels.  These were pretty scratchy.  The robes were nice, but not near as nice/soft as robes on cruise ships we've been on. *  the paper towels in the spa locker room were those brown paper towels you get in bulk for office buildings.  I expected much more from a luxurious spa. * the Dana goes by the "Honor bar" system, which is great, but unfortunately, 2 of the bottles of Voss water that we pulled out of the  wine cooler had obviously been opened and re-filled with tap water, which leads me to believe that housekeeping staff is not really checking appropriately.  Although, I do have to say, when I brought those bottles to the concierge they apologized profusely and brought up 2 fresh bottles (and didn't charge us, but we were honest and paid for them). * finally, the 2 person shower was great, but the 3 body jets coming out of the wall are way too powerful and are actually painful, so we didn't utilize them. Overall, I gave this hotel 5 stars because it was an amazing experience and the service was incredible.  I would highly recommend this hotel to others!;5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1937;2/19/2011;dKfzGLPvq5BfzDqRFIKJVw;FfLxtp7nETQljkaqpF3lgg;Wow. Really amazing room.  Amazing.  Ordered the room through a hotel website.  Asked for a corner king with two walls of floor to ceiling windows. What I got was an unasked for upgrade to room 701.  Stunning.  One bedroom, plus a living room, plus two balconies, plus a spa bathroom with dual sinks, and a shower of epic proportions.  The shower was easily bigger than my full bathroom at home.  It had two plate sized rainshower heads.  One was accompanied by a hand shower wand.  The other was paired with 3 aimable heads lined up vertically below said shower head.  The shower also had seating at opposite sides of the room.  When the glass door to the real world was closed, you could turn the heat up and sit sauna like.  It was the best shower experience i've ever had.  It will be my inspiration one day when we move out of our condo and into a house and re do the bathroom.  Truly, succulent goodness.  I guess there was other stuff in the room.  Well priced in room wine bar, with no wine over $25 bucks, save sparkling.  40" TVs in the bedroom and living room.  Affordable snack bar.  Zeppelin iphone dock in the living room which sounded incredible.  Why 4 stars?  The bed wasn't very supportive.  I like a soft bed, but this one was a little too soft.  And I suppose the point of a hotel should first and foremost be to get a good night's sleep. Not all beds are alike, i'm sure, and we may have just had a dud. Besides that quibble, this place was incredible.  Will definitely have another staycation in the spring when we can take advantage of the beautiful balconies.;4;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1938;11/16/2009;sBzCmpn55AqeISXbdacO0A;GoDWYAGipK81-GjyVgkKog;Sad - it's a beautiful space, but geez, weird and bad service. I had a reservation for a room with a king bed, there was a queen bed. There were holes in one of the sheets and comforter cover. When we turned out the light to sleep, there was loud base beat and our windows were shaking. Vertigo is on the 25th floor and we were on the 18th floor. We called the front desk and asked to be moved but were told they were full up and nothing they could do (no apology or anything but attitude). They said they'd send up security to give us ear plugs and they didn't show up until 45 minutes later. There was also this periodic knocking noise in the hallway or in the walls.  Breakfast seating not good, we sat at the bar because we were seated at a huge community table where it appeared people were waiting a while to even order. Staff were running around like their heads were cut off. Food wasn't very good and we had to ask for the usual salt, pepper, cream, etc. that you'd expect from standard service. Just too much bad stuff to shake off when you're paying over $200 an nite for a romantic weekend.;1;2;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1939;10/26/2010;JN8mENvsJ9sCkfgHNagj5Q;jC-LuL1IEU8TJp342DmWKw;After having an amazing stay at the Dana last year, I was looking forward to another stay. When we got to our room, I could tell things had changed. The gorgeous room a year ago was looking a little thread bare. The floor was filthy. I took my bath towel and cleaned so much dirt, hair and grime off the floor, the towel turned black. I actually brought the towel to the front desk manager to show him and all he said was "I'm sorry, I will tell housekeeping." Our blackout shade curtain was broken and stuck in the up position and our bed sank in the middle so we literally rolled towards the middle. Walls were scratched and dirty. They actually forgot to give us a wake up call... something that hotels just never do. It's always something you can rely on. Well, not here. It made us late for an appointment. After all that trouble, they only gave us $30 off a 3 night stay. The Dana Hotel has gone way downhill... fast.;2;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
1940;10/12/2009;rKC5vJYxWCLgttR1Oc29bQ;Dvjwzlfc_0Xewf8a9iZkGg;Attended a small conference at the hotel and stayed there for three nights (extended for long weekend of sightseeing after the conference).  My colleague and I were in total agreement that this was a stellar hotel experience -- on the flight home we tried as hard as we could to find something to criticize and couldn't come up with a single thing!  The modern design of the building was wonderful (new construction) and the interior design very contemporary but classy -- just the style we both like.  My room was a huge suite with great decor, a huge bathroom with gigantic walk-in double shower and two balconies. The make or break with any hotel room really is the bed and this one was fantastically comfortable with beautiful fine linens. You know, so many hotels have a trendy design aesthetic and decent beds, but what really made this experience supreme was the staff -- they were all young but on their game. Everyone from the clerks at check-in to the room service attendee, to the waiters in the restaurant, to the concierge, to the doormen, to the manicurist, they all just had that special something: a friendly quiet confidence in their manner that made you feel comfortable and taken care of. Bravo to them and the manager who knows how to hire for keepers. Bravo to all! I would stay here again without a moment of hesitation.;5;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

1942;5/22/2009;pcJnRrOaiAddnl9V4zUNCA;ZpzI2GhtSXUXs7rWSikwkQ;Beautiful hotel coupled with unprofessional and inattentive staff equals pretty vacant experience. We stayed in the standard room which still afforded ceiling to floor glass windows, beautiful glass showers, and city views in this newer high rise hotel in downtown Chicago. Really the only negative was the unprofessional staff. Several times during the stay there was no hot water. Apparently they were having a hot water problem and the engineering staff had no clue what they were doing.  He came into the room, tested out the shower and said, "you're right there is no hot water and I have no idea why but it should be fixed in a few hours." The manager who sounded like he was in his 20s, very inarticulate and unhelpful promised a discount for a future stay which never came into fruition. A frustrating experience not having hot water, not being able to shower at your convenience, showering in different hotel rooms and empty promises from unprofessional, incompetent, juvenile staff put a damper on what could have been a perfect experience. Additionally, skip the mediocre over-priced food in their restaurant and room service.;3;1;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA

I also liked the mold smell wafting through the entire building. This place is seriously bad. It is in need of a wrecking ball like no building that I have seen before. Bullet point list of things that suck about this place: Red AstroTurf carpet in room with stains Mold smell 100 decibel a/c system that could not be turned off Carpeting on the wall of the elevator Plaster falling off the walls in the shower Fluorescent lighting in the bathroom Screaming drunk 12 year olds running around at 4 am This place sucks.

I don't know if this place was "haunted", but it was disturbingly disgusting. The rooms are dark, dingy, smelly and just plain gross. The beds give you the creeps because of the recent bed bugs out break. I literally changed clothes in this room and that was it. I actually slept at a friends neighboring hotel.

1946;5/15/2012;neURhU5;MdPrbf7Kd0lP9WnykqCS7Q;I usually go to Chicago every June for an annual show, one year I left booking late and couldn't get my usual Marriott Downtown room and this hotel was my only geographically desirable choice. I stayed on the top floor corner room right across from Grant Park with a view of Lake Michigan. Other than the view, this hotel was awful especially the room. The rooms are not up to ADA code, they are dirty and old. Here is the rundown on my room: The bathroom door at a 45 degree angle opens out and hits the front door You step up to go in the bathroom (dangerous and obviously not ADA)...the architect was smoking something when he/she designed this. The shower pipe in the bathroom wet wall was missing a strap and moving and shaking when using the shower and the drywall was coming apart from the wall. Bathroom sink very small pedestal and no counter top Acoustical T-bar grid ceiling was very high and the tiles were stained from some leaks There was a very small leak and I had to ask for extra towels (I had the last room in the hotel) to put on the floor The hotel has some nice historic elements in the lobby, it just needs to be totally renovated and possible new plumbing throughout! I'm giving 1-star for the view, but I would of preferred to camp out in a tent next to Buckingham Fountain....:-);1;0;0;1;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

1948;11/5/2011;vtXZA204DXJy0QzEk5dOEw;qntMtvOSAOpkjyOlTp3q-w;Our room was clean, roomy and comfortable. The walls were a bit thin so we could hear the neighbors - but they were a group of 20-something boys (yes, boys) so I don't think any hotel would have blocked out the drinker talk of "helicopter dick". This is more a reflection on the kids than the hotel. Bathroom was small but just fine - decent water pressure which is important to me. The best part of the hotel - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. It was perfect. Price was fine though we seemed to be there on a really busy weekend so I bet you can find different hotels for less money at certain times. Really, if you're looking for a place to sleep - this place is not as bad as reviews would have you think (someone complained about 'cheap tiles' in the bathroom?

1950;4/26/2011;MUxJsV-9SR7dbJDu8wSrrQ;0WIijo3IdBPJgQ-s4hvRCQ;This is what I have to say about this poorly reviewed hotel. Location, Location, Location. Good Prices, Go with low expectations and be surprised to get a room with great views, clean faculties and comfortable beds. As a city tourist I wanted to be close to the water, near the museums and shopping.  With easy access for transportation weather it being taxi, bus or airport shuttle.  I went there with my sister who had to work, while I toured.   We got a room with a kings size bed and a full/queen size bed, located at the corner of the building and the layout was perfect for us two.   Yep the bathroom was dated, but clean.  You can tell they have remodeled recently.  I had gone there October 2009, so I was pleased to have a very pleasant stay.   Skip the hotel store....just go down one block to CVS if you need supplies.  And we did not drink at the bar... but we did eat a quick breakfast at the restaurant, I would not do that again.  The food was a 2 star.  Besides if you walk just a block or two there is so many other choices for your taste buds.   Again the location  is fantastic for a tourist or if you have business in this town.  I would return to this hotel and again have low expectations and ask for a corner spot.;4;9;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1951;11/6/2011;782T5Ab9gF1rITG;fSMMdVF34yR9GfDSgggqCQ;Stayed here 11/4/11 for the weekend. I am never one to complain and I usually make the best of any mediocre or sub par situation, i think trips are what you make them with your attitude, but this hotel was awful for the price. Long story, but we got 2 nights at the hotel from a friend who couldn't make the trip. That being said it was ok since we paid half of what he paid for it. At $170 a night for two people (before taxes/fees), I was appalled by the experience. I have stayed at nicer hotels on Michigan Ave. for cheaper and with better amenities for the price. I can't believe what hotels think they can get away with. We had a double room on the top floor, it was tiny and felt like a dorm. The view was an interior room of the other side of the north tower we were in. There were two beds when clearly in the past this room was made for one bed. The bathroom door wouldn't even open all the way from the bed being in the way. Our room was so hot, it was unbearably uncomfortable. Maybe it is common, but I have been in hundreds of hotels and have never had a room where you couldn't choose between having AC or heat.  I realize this hotel is old (it definitely needs updates) but the entire hotel was set for heat. Our window only opened 2 inches and we had to keep the room door open whenever we were in the room just so we wouldn't be smothered by the temperature. For the cost you think you could get something nice out of it. Asking for a fridge was extra. Internet was $11 a day. Room service was average and overpriced, not available late at night, and are subject to 11% tax, added gratuity, and a delivery charge! I just hate added fees. The mattress and bedding was the cheapest I've experienced at any hotel. You could feel every spring and the linens were scratchy and thin (not that you needed them to stay warm). The website for this hotel is EXTREMELY deceiving!!! It looks like the pictures for this hotel were taken 30 yrs ago. The same could be said about the pictures the hotel features on its postcards, in room service binders, and room keycards. The furniture is not the same even in the lobby. The furnishings and decor do not match the styling or updates made decades ago. Parking was $28 a day. Nuff said. Only pros: location right on Michigan Ave, flat screen tv, clean room/bathroom, nice concierge.;1;1;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

Such a bad experience I don't even want to waste the energy to write about it. Workers have been on strike here for ages. Not sure if that's the reason, but the rooms were not in great condition. (They were reasonably clean, though.) The iron in my room leaked badly. When I called the front desk to ask for a new one, the woman wasn't very friendly. I politely explained that I had to leave for a meeting in a few minutes, but still no iron after 30 minutes. Good thing I didn't really have a meeting, just an educational session I was okay with missing. The lines in the lobby were always bad. We tried to save time on checkout by using the machine, but it didn't work (not even a little).;2;1;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

Other than that, you're just looking at a boring, lame, empty and if I'm being honest, too brightly lit hotel bar. No thanks.;1;7;2;4;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1954;9/7/2010;-UIUv5;uLhyw1b1gX6FREf6L4cRmQ;Here are 5 things that I would rather do than stay at this overpriced  hotel: buy used tampons at a garage sale for my wife, roll around naked in a stinky puddle on Lower Wacker Drive, watch 2 guys and 1 cup, donate to the Cannibal Flesh Donor Program, karate chop a moving train and, drink a cup of coffee made from coffee beans that have been regurgitated by a weasel. Why would I do all those things? Because there is no way that ANYONE should even consider spending the night at the Congress, it's an insult to both decency and intelligence. Sure it's located on Michigan, sure it's right in front of Grant Park but, the room and the service there would make you think you just checked into a roach motel and, for good reasons:let me count the ways: First, we wanted to stay in a non-smoking room. After traveling to the 7th floor we opened a closed corridor, to get to our non-smoking room, and were hit with the ever teasing smell of marijuana. I don't know if someone had just passed through there smoking it or if someone was getting spliffed-out in one of the rooms but, the smell was so strong that we told one of the maids and she said that she would call security. We entered our room and, thank God, there was no smell in there. Instead... ...we found: mold in the bathroom, funky carpet molding that looked like it had been a termite's nesting ground in the 50's, the wallpaper looked like my 7 year old niece put it up using paper-mache, the bathroom door looked like it had been painted over 100 times since the sixties with bits of paint chiping off revealing the several layers of paint underneath like the Grand Canyon.  There was also NO refrigerador in the room, WTF? Come on, even a Super 8 has that and I won't have to pay 3x as much:this fact really sucked since we had just eaten a deep dish pizza and need someplace to store the left overs. And finally, the bathroom itself...let's just say I've seen and used better gas station stalls than the one at the "presigious" Congress Plaza Hotel. But wait, there's more! The room was so crappy that we decided to go downstairs and reduce our stay there to just one night - we were extremely tired. We finally made it downstairs,weed smell was being delt with by opening up ONE hallway window btw, and tell the receptionist our take on their hotel. To the Congress' credit she did try to accomodate us by sending a free mini-fridge to our room, seems that the hotel does in fact have them, they just happen to cost $10 extra per night. So, at this point, we just wanted to speak to the manager to let him/her know that we were very disappointed, we did this NOT to be comp'ed, we did this to air our frustration. The manager was at the other end of the reception desk so the reception clerk told us to head down and that she would be with us shortly. I can't really pin point when it was that my wife and I decided, "fuck this place" but, it must have occured during the 30 minutes that we were left waiting to speak to the manager. She saw us, she knew exactly why we were standing there, she passed by us several times without ever so much as an, "I'll be right with you." We finally spoke with her and quite honestly, she seemed indifferent about the whole matter, I believe her name was Elsa or Elda. She told us that she could refund our money back to our card but that all personal belongings had to be out of the room. So... We head back up stairs through the veil of herb stank and, what do we find in our room? The complimentary mini-fridge that the girl at the front desk sent up to our room, right? WRONG! Appearantly, besided the crumbling decor of the Congress, they must have a real inept or just plain lacadasical staff because instead of having a mini-fridge, they sent up an extra foldable bed which wasn't even placed, say, by the bed against the wall, no sir, it was left haphazardly and smack dab in the middle of the room. What the fuck? That's when I came to the conclusion that it must be the staff that's smoking out in the corridors. We finally make it back down, and we finally get our refund put back on the debit card, it'll of course take 7-10 business days which totally sucks because now we are left with having to find a new hotel -$400. We ended up finding a hotel inside the city proper which met our expectations and fulfilled our quartering needs. So, with all that has been said, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL!!! LOOK AT THE FUCKIN' REVIEWS (too bad we didn't)!!! The only place that the Congress looks nice is the ground floor were there's more than enough architectural eye-candy  and restaurants to convice you that the place is top-notch and, convince ppl it does:during this whole ordeal, I was amazed at how many ppl were gladly paying money to stay in a craptacular shit hole. Save your money, don't even think about staying here, because the only thing that you're paying for is the location, nothing more.;1;18;6;17;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

I can't really pin point when it was that my wife and I decided, "fuck this place" but, it must have occured during the 30 minutes that we were left waiting to speak to the manager. She saw us, she knew exactly why we were standing there, she passed by us several times without ever so much as an, "I'll be right with you." We finally spoke with her and quite honestly, she seemed indifferent about the whole matter, I believe her name was Elsa or Elda. She told us that she could refund our money back to our card but that all personal belongings had to be out of the room. So... We head back up stairs through the veil of herb stank and, what do we find in our room? The complimentary mini-fridge that the girl at the front desk sent up to our room, right? WRONG! Appearantly, besided the crumbling decor of the Congress, they must have a real inept or just plain lacadasical staff because instead of having a mini-fridge, they sent up an extra foldable bed which wasn't even placed, say, by the bed against the wall, no sir, it was left haphazardly and smack dab in the middle of the room. What the fuck? That's when I came to the conclusion that it must be the staff that's smoking out in the corridors. We finally make it back down, and we finally get our refund put back on the debit card, it'll of course take 7-10 business days which totally sucks because now we are left with having to find a new hotel -$400. We ended up finding a hotel inside the city proper which met our expectations and fulfilled our quartering needs. So, with all that has been said, STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM THE CONGRESS PLAZA HOTEL!!! LOOK AT THE FUCKIN' REVIEWS (too bad we didn't)!!! The only place that the Congress looks nice is the ground floor were there's more than enough architectural eye-candy  and restaurants to convice you that the place is top-notch and, convince ppl it does:during this whole ordeal, I was amazed at how many ppl were gladly paying money to stay in a craptacular shit hole. Save your money, don't even think about staying here, because the only thing that you're paying for is the location, nothing more.;1;10;4;8;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1956;3/13/2008;7I9kVKj9rHIUn3N14y5-KQ;DAf3UOAONCpgETWlNTERKg;I asked my Airport Express driver what he knew about the Congress Hotel, to which he replied, "You mean the strike that's been going on for five years?" Um, yeah the hotel workers have been on strike for FIVE years. The owners of the Congress are the only ones in the entire city who will not negotiate w/ the union. That's effed up. But I didn't know that when I booked this super cheap hotel on Michigan Ave for a conference recently. For its location and size, you can tell that the Congress must have been nice in its heyday...now it is pretty dilapidated and has a very strong, persistent Lysol smell. The rooms are pretty minimal and the beds...well, let's just say that you can tell how old they are by how small the double bed size is. Not too much you can even say about service...this place is like a ghost town.  At least it's clean and conveniently located hear Grant Park, the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. But even for how cheap it was, I still feel guilt for crossing the picket line (which they still walk EVERY DAY). And that's just not worth it.;2;9;3;2;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1957;10/22/2010;5xhRv99-8eHNXFIfQN7Kdw;pFBeUN4O6mgChLfYI9oIPQ;Can I write a review if I've only been to the hotel bar? I appreciated a lot of things in the bar at the Congress Plaza Hotel, named {something} Tap, like the mahogany wood, the copper bar, and the pillars surrounding the windows which made it look like at one time this area was completely open and airy. This place must have really been something, circa 1910, and it saddens me to see what it has become. The Red Bull cooler behind the bar and the neon beer signs in the window clash with the ambiance. Wait...actually, the ambiance clashes with the ambiance. There are no cocktail waitresses and the few people they have delivering the food look super ornery. The clientele is kind of a mixed bag of "what the hell" and "aww, you poor thing from Idaho that accidentally booked a room here." Still, my friends and I were in need of a little girl chat and wine so we ordered what has come to be known as The Worst Bottle of Wine Ever. It was a 2008 pinot noir, it was $44 (highway robbery!), and it tasted like it had turned. Still - and I'm unsure how this happened - we choked it down, alternating sip of wine with sip of water.  Today I feel like I'm going to vom.;1;4;2;1;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1958;5/7/2006;R6xes9mylHXOokEaIjzQzA;dMZgdAKH4_StC5pG1O0zFQ;I stayed here in 2000 and felt like I was in that resort in the movie The Shining. It was a very creepy place. From the looks of the other reviews, it doesn't look like much has changed.;2;4;0;2;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1959;1/13/2008;Ao2xb81KgctQlT9a5EGeuw;HwMZ0ld2P4V4-kSw-YxjGA;I'm giving the Congress Plaza Hotel three stars because it was the only place in Chicago that had a suite that could fit 16 people. Mind you it technically on slept 6 but we shoved 16 people into this two room plus foyer and bathroom with one king and two double bed suite!  And after the 16 of us divided up the cost of the suite I think it was only $35 a person.  Not bad for a night in Chicago! Plus I believe the management caught on to our little charade but they never said a word.  Not to mention we all slept comfy on air mattresses, the floor and the beds!  If you are looking for a cheap way to stay in Chicago this would be the way to go.  I just suggest getting along with everyone that you are staying with! The hotel itself is okay but does need some up keep especially the bathroom.  It's an older hotel and I would suggest dusting but I can't complain we got a great deal!;3;2;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1960;12/13/2007;Vz1uv80h2VTlkyZrx4oISA;-7KsknNh6tpHJPjs52sYsA;This place is only a couple of blocks from my project site, so we often go here for drinks at the bar.  We just recently spent quite a bit on a holiday party that I was a tad underwhelmed by. The service was good and things were set up well, if we were 5. The tables and chairs belonged in a pre-school classroom. We had "tall boys" too, but those were just for standing.  After 5 hours in heels I wanted to sit and enjoy my drink in peace.  But I felt like a 5 year old sitting at the table while all of the grown-ups walked by.   Side note... they don't decorate except for some white tablecloths, a table votive and red napkins.  It's all DIY, which was ok, but would have been nice if they did something for the holidays. Anyway... The food was only ok.  The chips tasted like stale poo (not that I officially know what that tastes like), but everything else was decent. It's close and convenient, but it might tell you something that they were available for a holiday party 2 weeks before the event.  3 stars because the servers were really really nice and they allowed us to extend our party for 2 hours, which means that they're also pretty flexible. Overall things were pretty good - from a work holiday party perspective.  I have no idea what the rooms look like, but hopefully they have furniture made for adults.;3;2;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1961;6/20/2011;VL37pniCBzEyuWlQTfPKIQ;KSALDxIXjab-zajClOnzOQ;I could not wait to get home to write this review. I wanted to write this review so bad, I was going to do it from my phone while I was waiting on my flight to go home. One thing that I've learned about reading reviews is it is a review FROM ANOTHER PERSONS PERSPECTIVE. I say this because maybe my upbringing is greatly different from other reviewers. I believe my upbringing helps me b/c I don't go to places I read reviews on and look for the issues that people complain about. I go with ZERO expectations. Some people standards are just too damn high to be honest. You can't go from eating at Brazilian Steakhouses to Applebees and review it the same.....that's just not a fair grading scale. With that being said, I read the reviews about this hotel and how dirty and how old and how dated it was and it kinda shook me up a little bit and almost made me look at another location, but I stuck to my guns and said I need to check it out for myself. I was born and raised in New York City and I believe people who are from older cities with old housing/real estate can see the bigger picture and know that buildings that are several years old is just the norm in older cities. Now to the review: The hotel served it's purpose. I came to town for the Cubs-Yankees baseball series and wanted to be in a prime location since I have never been to Chicago. It was directly across the street from Grant Park and two blocks away from the Harrison Red Line CTA Station, which was awesome. Were there people outside striking like everybody said? Yes. Did they bother me, NO.....I swear, people allow the smallest things to bother them. We got there around 11am, so it was too early to check in, so we were able to leave our bags with the bellboy in the storage room. The people that worked there were really helpful and kind. I stayed in room 691, so the view was in between buildings, but was able to see the Sears (Willis) Tower perfect. The elevators were not slow for me. Didn't have to wait no more than 2 mintues, EVER. Don't know where everybody got that one from. Slow as in speed or slow in having to wait for one? It's only like a 15 story building....how fast are they supposed to go? The room was just fine. It was an older room in an older building, but it was very spacious for three tall guys 6'4, 6'5, and 6'8. It had a TV with a remote, running water to wash up and it was very clean. That's all I ask for in my hotel stays, nothing else. Don't need my towels folded into a little monkey hanging off the doorknob in my room, don't need a mint on my pillow, don't need to get my ass kissed, just good customer service and people that do their jobs. That's pretty much it. I don't stay in hotels to admire the draperies and the paint color schemes.....just to rest my head, shower and the room be clean. In closing, I would stay here again without any hesitation. I think people should use reviews to get a good feel for what you're about to get into, but you shouldn't use them to make your decisions. If it was as unbearable as people have put it out to be, then why are they still in business, especially in the location they're in? You have to meet codes and health guidlines to keep the doors open and obviously they meet them. People just need to grow a pair and stop walking around with their noses in the air;4;23;11;10;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1962;11/30/2009;7d0E4o--WhhIajCeEgDRCg;aseG8fAtms9e5ygczKFGsw;I stayed here in 2006 for a conference. It's a historic hotel, that looks like it's seen better days. It was a swank place back in the 30's, but it's outlived its usefulness. The rooms are old and dated. Standard cable TV. Bathrooms weren't anything special either. Parking was a bit steep at $40 a night. The bar wasn't impressive either. Since I was staying on someone else's dime, the room was charged to a corporate credit card, and I put my personal card down for incidentals. 3-4 months after I checked out, I found a charge for $86 on my credit card from Congress Plaza. I tried calling the business office to see why I'd been charged. I never got a call back. Finally, I got my credit card company to intervene, and we placed a 3 way call to the hotel, which gave us nothing but attitude. I wound up getting the charge reversed, but it was a major pain in the ass. Also, there's picketers outside, and they've been on strike for several years over the hotel's low pay and working conditions. http://www.congresshotel… and http://www.congresshotel… has more on the shithole you'll be staying in (regardless of whether you're pro-union or not, it's still an abortion of a hotel) There's no way in hell I'd stay here again.;1;1;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1963;9/13/2011;32xi4bQembRyqS13PJ6E4w;acnFZaWmTC913XgMNJY3GA;I wish I had good things to say:but never stay here.  My wife and I have stayed here twice.  The first one was bad and we should not have gone back.  My wife was back in September 2011 and the hotel placed her in a room with a connecting door.  She was suspicious of the lock on the door:but it required a key to lock.  She placed her shoes in front of that door as an indicator.  When she got back to her room - her shoes had been tossed away from the door and the person who had broken into her room had gone through her suitcase!  When she talked to management of the hotel - they were reluctant to give her another hotel room and wouldn't apologize for the break in or the fact that the room staff did not lock the door in bewteen the rooms.;1;1;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1964;9/9/2011;hQX2SRU5mecif61fVUxDig;bbPkyu8iMHPEmzi-y0VVxQ;Worst hotel I have stayed in 5 years.  Poor staff attitude.  No hot water shower.  Crappy bed.  Cracking walls.  No wireless in room.  Low quality tiles and bath tub.  Cheap curtains.  Cracking electricity outlets.;1;0;0;2;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1965;8/16/2011;gY6R;cC5T4Bo749c-BXrGRJL82A;My wife and I booked a room at the Congress Plaza Hotel.  We found what looked like a water cockroach in our bathroom.  We called the front desk and was put on hold for over 10 minutes without explanation.  Two staff members who did not identify themselves showed up at our room door.  When we told them there was a large insect in our bathroom, they immediately denied the existence of the bug.  They went in and quickly glaned inside the bathroom and maintained their denial of such insect.  I had to literally point it out to them in order for them to believe me.  They identified it as a water bug that comes up through the toilet.  What did they do?  They flushed it down the toilet!  Right after they said that's where it came from!  They did not remove the bug from the room or kill it. Finally the front desk took us off hold on the phone.  I informed them of what happened, and they said they only had 1 room in the entire hotel to offer if we wanted to change, but it was much smaller.  Whether or not that was true is yet to be revealed but at that time I did not believe it. The next day we checked out and was not asked whether we enjoyed our stay, so we took the liberty of once again voicing our displeasure. We were comped a free breakfast which honestly made no impact on our confidence of this hotel.  Why would we eat at a place we feel does not put priorty in cleanliness of their guest rooms? The front desk attendant apologized on behalf of the hotel and we never spoke to the manager face to face.   Overall, the only thing worse than finding a roach the size of your thumb sitting on your toothbrush, is the inexplicable indifference shown by the management to resolve our extreme discomfort over the whole situation. Never again will I stay here, nor will I recommed to anyone.;1;2;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

1967;11/7/2011;kGhMY7sFAkpfJgiaO6U72g;iMsNbSb_AGLuwHcLSuirxg;I booked a double bed room for one night, cost me $241.19, $209.00 plus $32.19 tax. It did not look like on the picture whatsoever. Furniture looked like it was beaten many times by some angry customers. The air in the room was very hot, and there was no any thermostat in the room to change the temperature. For valet parking they charge $33.00 if you roll the car to the front, if you bring it to the garage yourself  it cost $28.00, and guess what, guys, to use an Internet will cost you $9.95. We checked in at 3pm, left the room at 6pm, came back after dinner,around 9pm, no one came to check up on room and refresh it. Next time I would stay somewhere else.;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1968;7/2/2011;WoCECELNArV6qbVIPWEqyg;n731wHZ8fRinXkos8f7zzQ;I, too, was scared to stay in this hotel after reading multiple terrible reviews.  My boyfriend and I planned a trip to Chicago because we have such a love for this city.  I was worried I was going to have a terrible, scary experience, which may ruin my trip here.   We had read ahead of time about the Congress being a haunted hotel.  We did not, however, have a haunting experience.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left everyone in the hotel was super helpful and pleasant.  The parking situation was a little crazy, as the parking lot was also a lot for Taste of Chicago.  The parking attendant, once finding out I was a hotel guest, put me as a priority in front of all others trying to park.   The room definitely had character.  Yes, there's old wallpaper.  Yes, the carpet is old, dark red and dingy.  Yes, the shower curtain looks old.  But, the fact that the wallpaper and shower curtain has the Congress Hotel logo was neat.  I felt like I was staying in a piece of history, which is hard to find anymore.  The bathroom was clean, the room was clean, I checked for bed bugs and there weren't any.  Housekeeping was really fast.  We'd leave for breakfast and by the time we came back, our room was clean and ready for us.  On top of everything else, the location is excellent!  There are tons of places to eat within walking distance, it's close to the L and Grant Park is right across the street.   I hope this review is helpful for anyone reading the horrible reviews.  I think it's a hotel everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime.  The elevators are old and GORGEOUS!  Also, go check out where room 666 is supposed to be.  We read the room is sealed.  It's not just sealed...it was covered by a wall!  If you look on floor 5 and 7, you'll see the difference.  Maybe it's just me, but I felt like I was sightseeing right in the place where I was staying...at no extra charge :-);4;3;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

If you want to come to Chicago & stay someplace generic that you'll forget, that's up to you.  If you want a place you can talk about having stayed there years later... that's this place.  If you're not totally hung up or stuck up, you'll get past the dated interior. But- don't complain to management when the hair stands up on your neck after you could swear something just followed you to the elevator.  Haunted it is.;4;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1970;8/4/2008;wSN1nI2ZFVIQrucG-6l4tw;A2thk5Aw1HcY22RBFbhFBQ;After reading the reviews on this site and tripadvisor I came pretty close to canceling my reservations at the Congress Plaza for Lollapalooza weekend. I live downtown, and had booked the hotel for it's convenience to Grant Park, thinking that it would be easier to commute 2 blocks rather than 15. I have to let you all know that, perhaps because I was expecting the worst, I was pleasantly surprised.  Our room on the 13th Floor, South Tower was clean and nicely appointed with a flat screen TV and 15 ft ceilings.  We didn't pay extra for a lake view, so we had a great city view.  The carpet was fresh, and while not overly decadent, the bedding was clean and new looking.   I didn't order room service, but I did request extra pillows, which were delivered within 10 minutes at 11:00 pm.  Nice! I understand that your experience could be much different, but for us, it was perfect!;3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1971;8/30/2009;stnnmJ-9bklzwiDG8EROgg;JUkHR7LCDNMTkiRF8r0oJQ;We stayed at the hotel on the following days: August 20 - 22 2009 and August 24 2009. We reserved the rooms on http://priceline.com and pain $129 for lake view rooms on Aug 20 -22 and $99 non-lake view rooms on Aug 24. The lake view rooms had gorgeous view of the Buckingham fountain. Their age does show though, but it's charming. The lobby was gorgeous and the employees were extremely friendly. The first night there, there were very loud hotel guests who came in around 4a.m., however they quietened down immediately after we placed a call to the front desk. The non-lake view rooms has a view of the lobby roof and they were very small with no bath tubs (they had standup showers.) As noted on other reviews, there were picketers outside the front entrance, (very depressing) but didn't really take anything away from our visit. The location was awesome, and the bellhops were extremely knowledgeable. Parking was $28 with unlimited in and out. Overall, I'd say this was a descent hotel for the price we paid for the accomodation. Keep your expectations descent and you'll be pleaseantly surprised.;3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1972;6/27/2010;GjKEKAuU1be;cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ;What you might not know about Yelp is that we try to kill our young. Sorta. Figuratively. Maybe. Charged with helping to train up one of our newest (give a shout out to Jon A in Indy:holla!), I needed to find a place where we could eat, talk and clickety-clackety in peace. Since he was staying downtown, I thought we'd do our trio o' biz downtown. It's somewhat ironic that someone who boasts an above-average knowledge of Chicago neighborhoods had NO IDEA where to go on Michigan Ave south of the loop. We wandered, stumbled, looked up, down and all around, and I had no idea of where to go. Finally, I spied some al fresco seats and a smartly-handsome facade. "Oh, a Michigan Avenue hotel. This is a good choice." Cue the part in the movie where the horny teens decide that skinny-dipping at Camp Crystal Lake at midnight is a good idea. We enter the dining room to find a decently-busy area. The waitstaff is a little preoccupied, so we wander around and, finally, get led to a table. It's not big enough for our purposes, so we move. Cool. Seated and lap tops out, I start the miseducation of Jon A (first single, "I Ate Nasty Food In Chicago"). Our waitress was extremely nice and a little nervous. It was her first day on the job. No biggie. I'll order a tonic with lime. "We don't have that." You don't serve tonic water? A hotel bar on Michigan Avenue doesn't serve tonic water? Alright. First Day. Training. No biggie. "I'll take a Sprite." It arrives. Flat. I gag a little. Jon peers at me. "Cannotflipoutinfrontofthenewguy." Alright. No biggie. First day. Training. I'll drink water. Waitress comes back and I order the SEAFOOD SALAD SANDWICH. Cue the part of the movie where the dim busty blonde doesn't care that her sorority sisters have just been hacked up. She's going to take a shower in the abandoned, haunted locker room right.this.minute. Jon looks at me as though I am crazy. I don't quite pick up on this. I am in professor mode. The sandwich arrives with another Sprite. Cool! Gah! It's FLAT! The second Sprite is flat. Gah! No worries. I'll try the sandwich. "It...tastes...not.good. Oh, wow. This is sorta gnarly. Hmm, I wonder why a mayo-based seafood sandwich served at a hotel with no tonic and flat Sprite tastes off. Gotta eat it. Can't scare the new guy." Meanwhile, I am completely oblivious to the fact that Jon is in dietary distress from his meal. Oops. In an attempt to stop eating, I go full throttle into a training session. Questions are asked. Questions are answered. Johnny speaks. Jon is razzle dazzled. The check comes...sweet, merciful Lord, the check! "Can I get you anything else? Would you like another Sprite?" "NO! I mean, I am full. Thank you." By this time, Jon is a little queasy, overloaded with info and disoriented. We leave and I find out that I just checked into the food (and hotel) equivalent of The Overlook. Welcome to Yelp. Hope you survive the experience!;2;10;4;16;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

1974;2/9/2007;jGkzqAexnyrwhi8lTX9Wcg;M9TNAXoCwA9A__uW3Jo66Q;If I could give Congress Plaza Hotel six stars, I would. If you're going to Chicago, MAKE SURE to stay in Congress Plaza. I absolutely LOVED this place. We had a beautiful room on the eighth floor overlooking the park, lake and Buckingham Fountain. You could see downtown with its tall buildings on the left and all the major museums on the right. It was a short walk from Magnificent Mile, Museum Campus, Chicago Art Museum, Library, and the Loop. The hotel itself has an exquisite interior. The entrance hall is stunning in its old-fashioned beauty and the ballroom on the second floor is simply breathtaking (especially if you're a ballroom dancer like me). The amenities are really hard to complain about: the ceiling and the doors might need a bit remodelling, but who looks at the ceiling anyway? Our room was beautifully decorated in burgundy red and deep green, with a comfortable, always perfectly made bed, elegant Oxford-style armchairs and a table in a beautiful bay window (thus the ease of admiring the view to all sides), and all the usual amenities. My friends from Chicago told me to stay in one of the new hotels and skip the Congress Plaza, but I'm so glad I didn't listen to them. Congress Plaza is not only the perfect location for sightseeing and shopping trips, but the rooms and the views from them are so beautiful that we actually had trouble getting out of the room! Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm not even looking at other places, just heading straight for the Congress Plaza website.;5;2;2;2;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

After booking the hotel and reading the Yelp reviews, I'll admit, I was NERVOUS. I don't know who is writing these horrible reviews for this hotel, but in my opinion, they were completely unwarranted.   We were central to so many great places, and very close to public transportation. It was about a 15 minute walk down Michigan Ave to the river and the Magnificent Mile. Grant Park is right across the street. The Aquarium is a 10 minute walk.  The location was definitely the best thing about this hotel. We spoke to the concierge staff a few times too, and they were all very knowledgeable, friendly and willing to help. I am not one that has to stay in 5 star hotels with every imaginable amenity. When I'm traveling, I view a hotel as a place to rest my head at night only. Why would I want to stay in my hotel room all day when I'm in a great city like Chicago? The hotel was definitely older, but I think that gives it character! Of course, I love older buildings... my home was built in 1895. The elevators were a little small.. but who cares! My only comment was that the hallways on our floor smelled a little bit like an older woman's perfume.... but whatever! Who knows, maybe someone was staying in one of the rooms on my floor with really bad taste in perfume? The room was absolutely clean and acceptable and perfect for our needs. That being said, if you are someone who does not appreciate older charm & who needs top of the line amenities at a hotel, don't stay here. You won't be happy and you'll just be one of those people who writes a really horrible review for a perfectly acceptable hotel.;4;2;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1978;12/23/2011;DlOkVxIjiWrSp;RgGl9FBKYFrXc6ZIxZOm-w;This place is not nearly as bad as most of the reviews would have you believe.  It's just old.  The staff was friendly and the lobby was actually pretty nice.  The room was $87 per night and was about half the size of a normal hotel room.  It was a bit beat-up.  For example, the baseboard had some sizable dents in it, and the paint was peeling on the heating unit.  Also, the bed was not the greatest.  The view was cool though, and it was certainly clean and sanitary.  No bed bugs, horrible smells, or anything like that.  So it's a decent value for the price and it will be fine as long as your expectations aren't too high.;3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1979;9/19/2010;HxsjbwT3-6G4VT-dp6HOfg;vuFqAy78DHh50N5tOUlldA;My wife and I stayed here with my Son for a short trip.  This is an old hotel, but we had a great experience.  The room was nice and clean and everything worked perfectly.    Its an old hotel so our expectations were not overly high, but the price for the location was great.;4;1;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1980;11/18/2007;xUWh9nLo5JgdvCICSzKBEg;p3UBcwT4ge-RHFV0Geib-Q;I travel quite frequently for business and I have to say this is one of ht eworst hotels I have ever stayed in.  The rumor is Al Capne stayed there and apparetnly they have not renovated it since he was there.  The carpet was stained, the plumbing ran all night & the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable.  The wireless internet did not work.  There was also a really long line to chekc in.  The gym was somewhere in the basement, but I never got to see it because you had to go down some creepy stairs.  I guess that is what you get for $180 a night in Chicago during the week.  On the upside, it is close to Millenium Park & THe Art Institute if you are there for fun.;1;1;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1981;3/13/2008;FFqjtrpVDZ2AM-1gBNG42w;vBcB5ABj5G8sOczDcp5j1Q;I know that there are bad reviews of this place but I actually enjoyed my stay. staff was very friendly, and I enjoyed the victorian styled rooms. they are also very  spacious, cheap and very clean. good cable, high speed internet and strong drinks in the bar also conveniently close to everything. this is a good place for people on a budget that don't wish to sleep in an expensive filthy cramped room but still want to be in the middle of it all. this is not a good place for a "huppie" that is used to the five star life.;3;1;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1982;2/8/2011;88dnDJ9k1SCi-yC6RXy16g;7c8OBUBnYL3U_4NxWQC79Q;I like the old feel and its a great price for downtown.;3;1;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1983;10/5/2005;yLQoLyxV0Xg9oS9KlXOhMg;iYzbRy7B_Ho3NX-1rXvRLQ;When I booked this hotel on the http://united.com site, they said that this was a 3 star hotel.  Yeah right!  The room they gave us smell like old people, had a tv from the 70s, holes in the ceiling, paint flaking off, and carpet that I wouldn't walk barefoot on!  I requested my money back and had to stay one night.  They upgraded me to another room that at least had a modern tv.  Don't stay here!!!!!;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1984;6/11/2010;EquAw7;Qx9Q9SPQEyKHdf2RwjFwXQ;After all the negative aspects and experiences that I heard about the Congress prior to my stay, I have to admit that it exceeded expectations. Sadly, that's not saying much. The room itself was fine - nothing spectacular, I had no issues with plumbing and a lovely view of the lake. The carpeting and tiles obviously have not been update in quite some time, so it almost has the look of a motel. The room was probably the best part of my brief stay. The front-desk service was very rude to me during my check in. The former employees that are still on strike make for an awkward entrance into the hotel during the afternoon. Not recommended.;2;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1985;8/12/2009;60ed26A46rOSekMJGfe6Ew;dcgyzGZteUtERtYwqRCYAQ;I really enjoyed my first stay here, however upon my return the staff was rude, there are still employees striking and they made us prepay at the restaurant while letting other people go in without doing it! when we pointed out that they hadn't made us prepay the day before they were outright rude. when i asked if there was fruit for my cottage cheese (which was 7 bucks) they said no, and then i saw all sorts of fruit on the $20 buffet, which looked pretty rough. the reception was pretty spotty, and the whole place smells like stale cigarettes. ugh.;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1986;2/10/2009;OLaulicSuj266Ovs7MAj8A;96yYADBkK-YnhHAAXi15pg;Stayed there with a couple of friends. It was really warm in the hotel and stuffy. Price wasn't bad at all. The building is kind of old.

1987;6/10/2010;rugPBuMPh7A7kiTrhgTjLA;J__wmAq0GXheqyHHTLQ9zg;I wholeheartedly agree, The hotel has become a sad case, Ever since the strike. Cold bathrooms, cold bar, You could LITERALLY feel a draft from the cold air. Went in March. 2005. It's certainly a classic, But NEEDS to be taken over by a different outfit. The ambience is pretty cold too. One of the things I actually liked about the place is it's large classic neon sign, That's practically about it..........And it being an old chestnut............;1;1;1;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1988;7/7/2010;OLawFCZqg486G08AcFIXHQ;FxK9DyeWyCo6tfQsO8V_8Q;This is my first review in Yelp, I am usually to lazy to review but i thought it is worth it to warn others agaisnt this hotel. I was looking for good deals online for a 1 week vacation in chicago downtown, i found congress hotel for $90/night, i thought it was great deal for the location and the hotel with the big name... i have walked by congress hotel many times in the passed and i was always impressed by the historical look of the building. i didnt think that anything would be wrong with this hotel so i didnt even bother to read review. some of my issues with the hotel: rude valet personal damaged walls, paint and  doors The room smells like mold TV reception was horrible A/C unit is inside the room and was dripping all night the walls between the rooms are soo thin that i heard my neighbor talking on the phone like he was in front of me till i fall asleep. and i heard his TV like it was in my room, it wasnt bc he was too long but bc of extremly thin walls. if you know  Motel 6, i would rate it 5 stars and still give 1 star to congress hotel. i booked my 7 nights stay at this hotel thru hotwire so there was no way for me to not get charged  if i decided to check out early, but i still checked out the very next day... i lost $600 but at least i enjoyed the rest of my vacation in different hotel. I highly discourage anyone from booking  this hotel without visiting it  in person first and see the rooms... Dont do it even if you are ok with staying at Motels. i would recommend paying more and stayin somewhere else or stay by the airport and take the blue line if you didnt have another choice in downtown.;1;1;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1989;11/20/2010;eWn;Msg8A4cuEI7bJszebP9Ekw;Never stay here. The air conditioning unit was really noisy and did not cool the room, after complaining to the front desk they didn't fix it in 3 days, then said air conditioning was not needed on that weather. (The noise wouldn't let us sleep and opening the windows was worse) The second night of my stay I left my camera at the room to go out for dinner and to my surprise only 2 hours later my laptop and SLR camera were gone... (Being in the 13th floor, there was no fire-scape or way of entry other than the card activated door) The security department told me NOT to call the police. Of course I called anyways. There was a pillow missing, I presume that they used to take out the items. There was no manager on duty and the staff was poorly trained. When I finally got hold of the Hotel President a few days later, the gentlemen was as rude as it staff and said that he could not even file a claim to his insurance company (if they have one) because it could not possible be proven that it was his staff. The room was not clean when I got there, I had to call and have them pick up some forgotten clothes in one of the drawers...;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
1990;9/6/2012;BDH;MIKByQgLWgXNU_26CX1Acw;The service here? Pretty good. They were pretty helpful, and not considering weird rules for the convention we were at, I'd say they were very nice. The rooms were OK, nothing special, but at the price, they were not up to what I expected. The food was GROSSLY over-priced, even for hotel food. The breakfasts were especially expensive, even the buffett (though the Oatmeal Pancakes were awesome!) The best part was the view, which the worst was dealing with things like poor elevator performance (this can be a problem at large cons) and a layout that was at least a good deal more complicated than I expected. Still, cost and food knocks it down a good deal. And there were spiders outside the windows. Giant. Scary. Spiders...;3;1;1;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
1991;9/2/2012;LuwOKwPHB48Rb6Y46ytvVQ;DAIF6BwUEBCPqPvhNby9IQ;This hotel is kinda hidden so we had a difficult time looking for it, but it is close to everything.  Walking distance to Magnificent Mile and Millennium Park. The room is very modern and a decent size. Yay! Flat screen TV! However, the bathroom is terrible. I'm not complaining about the size, but the design is so stupid. Geez, can a girl get some counter space? While we're at it, can my boyfriend and I get some toilet paper without pulling a muscle? The toilet is right next to the shower so the holder was attached to the tiny corner between the two so you can't reach it. We ended up just putting the toilet paper roll on the floor.   I was also excited about a fridge listed as an amenity, but I opened the cabinet to find it empty. Sucked they didn't have free wifi either! I'll probably try a different hotel the next time I'm in Chi-Town.;3;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
1992;9/21/2012;a2RB8yr2OqoGX7OZYb3wBA;csxREaNX4shKV-PZqNFyLw;We are big Hyatt fans and Gold pass members so it pains me to write this.  However, our experience as this located was below average.  The front desk is way understaffed.  They had a total of 2 people working on a Friday afternoon.  Needless to say, it took us 1 hour to check in.  The valet was equally bad.  We called down to have our car ready 15 min. in advance and of course had to wait an additional 20 min. each time we picked up our car.  Not very good service for $52/day valet. The room were okay and clean, but nothing special.  The only good thing is that the location is perfect and convenient to everything.;2;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
1993;8/13/2012;thjQbbpiVlwoljWsPYTvug;rqY0AQMUtoDQnfgxCNuKgw;Better than I thought it would be.  In fact, overall, I really don't have a big complaint about this place. Stayed for a conference at the same time Lollapalooza was going on and the staff did a good job keeping the groups separate but happy. They added cell phone coverage to the basement conference-level floors which is a huge help so kudos for them for doing it.  The Big Bar served nice drinks and was a good place to sit and watch the thunderstorm roll in.   Other plusses? Good breakfast buffet. Comfortable bed. Downsides? Street noise (right near a fire station) and slow internet.  Lobby is a little bit of a mess with renovations ongoing.   Would I come again? Sure, if the conference were staying there. The problem is that there are so many other great places to stay nearby (eyeing the Radisson Blu) that its hard to seek this one out. But it was A-Ok in my book and a solid place to stay for business.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
1994;8/19/2012;LBYoDEfYdiHDRTIYCKt9Jg;b7ZRzrF-BEWQtB5-LWskEw;Beautiful and luxurious hotel. Central Location, within walking distance to Navy Pier, Millenium, and Manificent Mile. Huge luxury hotel. Expensive parking (but its Chicago). Wi Fi charge for the room but free in lobby on the 2nd floor. Love the connection to Houlihans at Michigan Avenue...open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Small Grocery store one block away. Sensor locks on the hotel doors. Booked with third party retailer and never felt like it. Ipod alarm clock, coffee w/maker, flat screen, and the most comfortable bed that I have slept in. In room-safe. Instead of the amazing riverview, I had the view of the Fire Departmnt and the amazing looking Radisson Blu hotel. Greeted by name when I made a phone call. Offered a free USA Today because I passport member....many conferences going on but did not feel crowded. Bar is a little pricey, but hey, it's Downtown Chicago. I was more of a Houligans gal with the drink specials and plate specials.  I have stayed at this property in the past and could never afford to at the non-third party retail rate, so I appreciate that they offer a gal like me, "caviar and champagne lifestyle" on a "sardines and Tang" budget. They will continue to offer this, I will cross my fingers EVERY TIME for the Hyatt.;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I mean, most everything is literally right around the corner. Gorgeous lobby - the layout of the hotel amenities were a little disheveled though. Also, in addition to no free wifi in the rooms, apparently there is a also fee required to use the business center as well -  the rude employee at the door made us very aware of that. All of the other employees were amazing... except that chick. Nice rooms and ridiculously comfy beds - so much so that I overslept for an outing with a friend of mine, geesh!

1996;8/6/2012;qgYoVlwA4Xu6JnzVAkNW9w;id97cmQmqNJAglcMFbKPaQ;Writing this review after a sleepless night so I'm a bit cranky. Bed was one of the more comfy ones, but the ac was excessively loud and the room dry, city traffic and neighbors noisier than what I've experienced in Manhattan even though we are on the 27th floor (thin windows and walls), and the toilet makes a loud squeaking noise each time it's flushed. As for the rest of my stay, pros were the views, the location, and the service. Other cons were - the hotel common areas were freezing in the middle of summer and the hotel pub stopped serving food and drinks before midnight. May come back if there is a great deal, but need to be armed with ear plugs, sweaters, and sleeping pills.;3;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

AND my friends who did pay for wifi said it was extremely slow and not worth the cost. I recommend that you hire some consultants and get your network working properly. There are tons of hotels in Chicago that are right within the vicinity, for example, the Sheraton, Radisson, Fairmont, W, Westin, Marriott, etc.  It is a huge assumption on your part that I would ever stay at this Hyatt again, so, thanks but no thanks for seeing you for some special deal.;1;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Mind you, it's 3:45 pm in the afternoon, and I feel no desire to get out of bed anytime soon.Their bed is probably one of the comfiest things I've ever slept on!!! This is a massive hotel right in the middle of Chicago. I got a great deal online and could not be more pleased. The only drawback is that they charge for internet, but if you "like" them on Facebook, there are sometimes free internet specials. Also, their business center is closed at night so that's also kinda annoying. Otherwise, nice large room, wonderful location, perfect location. I would highly recommend this hotel! ----------------------- UPDATE: I just received the sweetest gift of delicious toffee candy and a sweet card wishing me good trip from the Hyatt about 30 minutes after writing this review. Yes, I'm still in this amazingly comfy bed. It is certainly the little touches that makes this a great hotel!;5;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Our room was quiet and felt like we were in a different hotel, until ppl checked in next door, we heard their entire conversation (luckily it didn't last long, unfortunately their snoozing of the alarm at 3am did). I would book again if I was a business traveler, visiting or having family in, but not a romantic (it was my partners bday) stay.  Also avoid Nataly at the check-in desk.  Shes a bit grumpy, rude and needs some sleep...but i guess we all have our off days;3;3;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

First thing you notice when you walk inside is the hugh space that have and the restaurant right in middle of everything.

2006;1/3/2012;zeo093rIJ3VrDhTE7LRVKg;70rUrXpxQeU2Ban7oJiN3g;"The largest Hyatt in the world," according to the desk receptionist.  This is a fantastic hotel, definitely a highway robbery of a deal I got on Priceline at the last minute.  The gym is absolutely state-of-the art.  I would even venture to say that it may rival stand-alone gyms in many cases.  For example, the treadmills can not only estimate your BMI, they can also give you a rough estimate of VO2 max as well.  While this technology is state-of-the art, think about how often you see something like this at a hotel gym.  There is also a wide selection of free weights as well and plenty of TVs. The room?  Also pretty nice.  The key cards don't need to be slid through the door:they are just tap onto the door and you're in, which I've seen at only one other hotel (Flatiron Toshi in Manhattan).  I had a fantastic view of the skyscrapers from my window.  I noticed that by the bedside, there weren't electrical outlets at least by the tables, but you had great flat-screen TVs. There's plenty of food options that are available.  A Starbucks in the building, a small cafe type area and also a great looking place for dinner, though I can't comment on the food as I have never had the time to eat there. Check-in and check-out are also out of this world.  You can check-in with a reeptionist, or you can check in completely on a kiosk, like you're an airport.  The check-out is also handled on the kiosks as well, as well as a drop off box before you leave as well.  The doormen are very helpful and courteous.  If you're staying for business or pleasure, see if you can snag a room at this amazing hotel situated on Wacker and not far from Michigan Ave and Grant Park.  http://Hotels.com say that many of these rooms are at least $200 a night, but if you get lucky and Priceline it, you can get yourself a great bargain.  Perfect for a romantic weekend if you're looking for a good hotel to stay the weekend in Chicago.;5;2;2;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2010;3/22/2012;s;uinionF5Jr2NObKUe2FusA;I stayed here on St. Patrick's day, so I paid a little more than usual on Priceline, but it was expected because the city was a madhouse. We parked in the underground parking garage, and that went smoothly despite the huge crowds. We got downtown at about 12:00 p.m., and the nice front desk woman told me a room wasn't ready yet (understandably, because we were early), but someone would call me when it was. Now the problems start.  There was an area where we could leave our bags while we were waiting for our room.  We brought the bags over to the guy, who was very busy because the hotel was nuts, got a tag for them, and started to walk away.  The guy muttered "seriously" as we walked away, so my friend said "sorry" and ran back and gave him a $5 tip.  I was thinking that we would tip them at the end, but if he wanted it now, fine. We went out to the parade, had some fun, and came back a few hours later for our bags.  There was a different guy running the bag check area.  We got our bags from him, meaning we pointed at them, and he moved them about 5 feet to where we were standing.  He didn't bring them to our room or anything, he just moved them 5 feet.  We started to walk away, and this guy yelled after us "no tip!"   Ok, I've worked in the service industry.  I realize that people want tips, and often depend on them.  We gave bag check guy number one $5 for putting a tag on our bags.  I do not think it was necessary to give bag check guy number two another $5.  Further, when is it ever appropriate to yell about tips at your customers?  There were about 1000000000 people getting their bags from these guys.  How much money is enough for them? That whole incident kind of ruined the hotel for me.  The room was fine, but someone needs to do something about that horribly rude behavior.;2;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2011;12/5/2011;UhMRaxXUY2abLFgv0mygnA;2suxk_b8tWaQE5zXZ17rlA;Visited Chicago for the very first time in my life on December 02 -04, 2011. You could not go wrong with this hotel. Hyatt Regency Chicago is very close to everything like the shopping on Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, the river, Marilyn Monroe statue, and so much more. It's all a walking distance. There are pictures that I uploaded for reference of what the inside looks like. It's spacious and the customer service provided was spectacular from the beginning to the end. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Chicago. The rate I had was $150/day which is not bad at all. It's beautiful inside and out and kept traffic moving so everyone can arrive and leave faster. Great service!;4;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2012;1/19/2012;q1-G-0qC;puUP7otIJotqTI-MCt3xWg;Book your room on Priceline. I named my price and got a killer deal on a room. This Hyatt is a symbol of luxury and fine hospitality. The staff are extremely helpful and will accommodate most of you needs with in reason. Check in is usually around 3:00 pm but since my flight came in at 10 they let me check in at 11 am and also gave me a late check out till 2:00 pm the next day (fyi: if they're not fully booked, they will do this for you as well). The rooms: extremely warm and welcoming with comfortable beds and a clean toilet. However I do wish there was a little more lighting available in the room. Food/Room Service: highly expensive. Michigan Ave is a block away and a lot of restaurant in the neighborhood so I would not recommend eating here if your looking the save a buck Parking: don't drive. take the cta;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2015;8/24/2011;iKjTcNa1mq9poAdCeakIeg;EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA;This place has been RENOVATED! (as of 8/24/2011) so many of the previous reviews may not apply if you see folks complaining about old, outdated decor and musty corridors. First, the Hyatt Regency in Chicago is the largest Hyatt Regency in the US. They have over 2044+ rooms and two large towers. Compared to Vegas, that may seem like nothing (Vdara houses an impressive 4408 rooms!) but here in Chicago, this landmark hotel definitely has presence. I got a deal on priceline and for once trusted my fate at a chain versus the boutique hotels I've been staying at in previous visits and I have to say, for the price I paid, it was well worth it. The front desk was pleasant, check in was easy and the room was clean. It smelled, felt, and looked clean and updated. The bed was large, comfortable, and the shower was well designed so you can let it rain or turn it on power mode to wash out that stubborn conditioner in your hair. The room service was ... OK since the hotel was big and it just takes forever to get anything but aside from that it was a very pleasant experience. This place is almost always crawling with kids, adults, conventions, tourists so just know what you're getting into.;4;4;3;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2016;8/29/2011;a-WEWs3NGn;qRg_8ByuH12bAd5Yjvxu0g;If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. Since I'm between 3 and 4 and can't really say I'm a fan, 3 it is. For the price, the hotel and our room were surprisingly good. No free wifi but otherwise the amenities were satisfactory. Apparently there was a renovation recently - the room was clean and comfortably modern. Checking in and out was relatively smooth. There were two main things that bothered me. First, the chaotic nature of the hotel lobby. It was a busy weekend (air and water show) and I felt like they weren't quite prepared for it. It was raining the first morning, and it took about 30 minutes to get a taxi through the teeming mass of hydrophobic hotel goers. There wasn't much organization and the hotel didn't seem to have any pull to get a good supply of cabs. Second, the concierge desk was overall pretty useless and almost, well, snotty. Also, it costs $20 to rent an umbrella. It's refundable, but you can't put it on your bill and you can't use a card. It's $20 cash or kick rocks. The location is good but I thought the hotels a bit further north gave a better starting point to get around the city.;3;2;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2018;8/17/2011;ZCN2tlwWtOdK11usoczpVA;TVgDN-CZ0wdszYCFXDtOug;This is a huge hotel that does a lot of convention business. However, we stayed here for pleasure and were very pleased. The rooms are decent size and clean with a modern decor. The staff is friendly and efficient and the location cannot be beat. There is a huge contemporary bar, appropriately named the Big Bar, a Pub, as well as a bistro and steakhouse on site. There is also a nice patio common area to relax at if you want to chill outdoors. The hotel is near Michigan Ave., Millennium Park, the Riverwalk and within walking distance to Navy Pier, the L, etc. I also appreciated the convenience of a very nice grocery store next door. Great property, great location!;4;1;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2019;2/27/2012;ySW1NBR2QPRKvrbPVfxKyg;_5ZU2jXJbffdKb7p1RvVfQ;I am a 'frequenter' and after the 20th time staying here,  it's consistently ranked among the best hotels I've visited for: comfort, responsive staff and comprehensive services.  It is a HUGE hotel compared to what I am used to yet I feel comfortable here. Show Me: The Hyatt is very central, I can catch the El , catch a cab, walk anywhere and it's close to great great restaurants.  So I have the food situation down by staying here.  As far as visuals, my favorite places to walk to are Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago when I  am here over the weekend- two stellar attractions in the city.  Downtown Chicago is about architecture and no where in our country can you witness amazing styles from Frank Gehry to Art Deco to modernist Chicago (I like to call it because I dont know the name, LOL).  I am not an architecture person but you cannot avoid admiring this beautiful city, the structures and how it evolved to an utopia of American life.   From atop and street level of this hotel you can witness Chicago during rush hour:  a marvel of orderliness and efficiency.  People queue up to get on public transportation 24x7.  Where in the world do you see behaviour like this?  It's not like NY where "it's every man for himself"   The subterranean roads for trucks/deliveries  separate from city traffic is genius!  Whoever thought about this solution was way ahead of her time!  I am constantly amazed that such a huge metropolis functions efficiently day in and day out, chaos minimized.  There's still traffic yes but somehow rush hour 'feels' organized here. Stay & Work: Pan back to your personal space.  Rooms at the HR are modern, very comfortable but not spacious by Cali standards.    Be prepared these are Euro/ NY-sized rooms.  I've received faxes (delivered when requested), I've sent faxes, received packages, nothing lost.  I've requested printing services, messengering, even paper and what sets the HR apart is I don't get the "No you can't " vibe here.   Service is prompt.  I bring a data card everywhere I go so WIFI is not an issue. I can work here and request a service and in 10 minutes max, bingo!   Gym facilities are up-to-date and clean.   I love the workout/cardio machines here more than any of the other ("Big 4") hotels  and depend on them regularly.  I especially appreciate who ever thought about the shape of the Hyatt gym towels, they're super long enough to wrap around your neck..... long enough to lay on a machine to cover the back of your head down to your back.    If you are concerned about hygiene at the gym, you know what I am talking about.    The heating/cooling systems are efficient and never had a complaint.  Hyatt is truly making an effort to be distinct.  They're checkin process is different from most hotels.  I feel the lodging experience here is about comfort and personal service. Leave Me Alone: When you hang the DND tag on your door, they will not knock even if its after 1pm.  The will expect  for you to call Housekeeping when you want your room to be serviced or not at all.    No accidental knocking from housekeeping.  In the morning hours, housekeeping staff tend to work in the background, unobtrusively.  I like that.......Lemme sleep however long if I want to! Feed me: Food-wise, I can order a perfectly grilled steak (not cheap) or surf and turf made in the same style as a superior steakhouse like Gibsons (a mile down the block).  Oddly almost any restaurant closeby, high-end or not, will deliver to the Hyatt, no extra charge.   I use my trusty Yelp app to monocle a restaurant closeby.   I've done this before a few times...........  in the dead of winter when there's absolutely no way I'm going out there!!!.  Not even to walk 4 steps into a cab.  No way, ah- ah....LOL! I can survive in this hotel without leaving it's premises. Visits:  20+;4;13;5;2;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2020;7/11/2011;2wllGe-q5hTBUkLF4J6RbA;eT6VaR-4VxozZbDM4mOv_Q;Stayed at the Hyatt this weekend for a getaway with my husband. Didn't really have any crazy expectations since all Chicago hotels are usually fairly nice. I was completely blown away. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. Probably the nicest suite I've stayed in to date. BEAUTIFUL furnishings and layout of the room. View from the 26th floor was great. The hotel was very acomodating and even delivered complementary chocolate to the room. Nice touch! Room was joining on both sides and the other occupants were slightly loud, but it didn't bother me because the environment in our room was amazing. I would absolutely stay at the Hyatt in Chicago again and recommend it to anyone looking for a lavish experience.;5;2;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2021;10/18/2011;Z0ILF7eoyFQATTmF;KLTOp3T-HEeIwD8hOxXGGQ;I was never impressed with this location the two times I've stayed for conferences. The rooms were dated (looks as though others agree with this), and the service was never quite what I expected. Granted, it's a high traffic convention hotel, but given the location and all of the potential that this place/name/location has...I expect better.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2022;11/23/2011;wcUS55kX-4-Jhc7Om3QRBA;1y_b3g-rTAFH4XLdEkfT2w;A+ for location.  The famous landmarks Millenium Park, Magnificent Mile and downtown are within walking distance only.   I liked the service.   Valet parking is $50/day.  You can go to Park Millenium to avail of a $30/day parking deal.;3;0;0;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2023;4/19/2011;y3KXJ7Ocg3CvtazT9QgbkA;3qdOo7aWhIHWrKuT9jw3Gg;It seems I always have a problems with elevators. This time, HEARING them. Constantly. That, combined with the airplane noise, made me wonder why they didn't spend some renovation money on better soundproofing the rooms. In fact, if you stand long enough in the bathroom, you can actually HEAR conversations from within the elevator. So, note: if you receive a room near the elevator lobby, I suggest you change it. As for that airplane noise, I stayed in the hotel next door last year, and didn't hear a thing from the outdoors. Moving on, we were given a room in the newly renovated tower, which still had that "new carpet" scent. The room was huge and spacious, with a nice view of the city. The beds at the Hyatt are ALWAYS comfortable -- I love them so much, I want to buy one. But the pillows? Suck hard core. Every Hyatt now seems to stock these tiny, almost square head pillows. If I'm in a King bed, I kind of want matching King pillows, you know what I'm saying? The people who work here are amazing -- everyone from the luggage guy to the concierge to the check-in/out staff, and even the guy who hails the cabs for you. I like that the hotel has a mini store on the lower level, where I was able to purchase coffee, milk and cereal, a banana and a variety of other snacks for the room. That said, you know it costs like 3x more than if you bought it in a store yourself ($8 for said bowl of cereal, big chug milk & banana). Oh, the sake of convenience, right? Also, we had "no smoking" signs in our room, which made me believe that some rooms DO allow smoking, which I smelled quite frequently throughout our weekend stay. I'd stay at the Hyatt Regency again simply because of its location and value for the room price.;3;2;2;2;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2024;4/19/2011;kJIJyeFWuvrxFJFtZ4ET2Q;oLfxkopDkEhVQMpHWjEUUg;We stayed here this past weekend for 2 nights, and I must say, it's some of the best rest I've gotten in a hotel bed ever. The beds, pillows and comforters were so comfy! Had drinks in the Bar 151 inside, and also the "Big Bar" - nothing like paying $6.50 for a domestic bottle beer and $11 for a Bloody Mary, but I guess that's the price you pay for convenience of being in a hotel bar. The bathrooms were nice, could have used a little more counter-space but whatever :) I like a fairly roomy bathroom and they had good ones. I wasn't a fan of the toiletries in the room, NO one in our party liked the lotion (LOL, we had two adjoining rooms) but I always bring my own anyway. Usually if I don't use it, I'll lift the toiletries for a future trip, but in this case I passed. Not a huge deal but sometimes getting these little extra "freebies" is some kind of treat. Good location, friendly and accommodating staff, and I love that they allowed us to leave our bags after checkout on Sunday for a few hours so we didn't have to lug them around the city until we departed. We were on the 28th floor and I didn't find the noise level to be too bad. I didn't notice any inconsiderate neighbors, but we were nicely located at almost the end of the hall. The view wasn't the best, but interesting. Our room was facing two office buildings. Saturday it was pretty empty, but on Friday afternoon when we arrived, people were still working and we had fun peering in and commenting on the activity going on with working strangers across the way. Overall, a very nice stay!;4;1;1;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2025;7/17/2011;66k0PEeGOwHR4AFwbL47hQ;j7Ew20Kh33lFEaUXW1rGNw;This hotel has a pretty good downtown location and isn't too far from the metro stations. Also the staff was very friendly. Now for the negatives: no free wifi, the hotel is huge so the layout can be a bit confusing, there was an issue where the phone in my room didn't work, bed was just okay and the room furniture had this strange modern/uncomfortable vibe. Also, the rates can be pricey depending on what deal you get. I would consider staying here again if the price were right but i'd say the hotel is okay but nothing special.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

This is a large property that finds its Front Desk and other services becoming overloaded all too easily - a housekeeping issue took over a day to resolve. And there is a design "issue" with the West Tower - there are either an insufficient number of elevators, or they run much too slowly ... 10 minute waits are simply not acceptable!

I feel like this hotel really has social marketing down - follow them on Twitter or "like" them on Facebook and it opens up a new world of communication.  They're responsive, offer specials on parking and free wi-fi, even drink specials at the bar.  It kind of made my day when I "checked in" on Yelp and got a welcome message back through Twitter!   I'm looking forward to our stay this weekend, and the Hyatt Regency is quickly becoming my hotel of choice when I'm in the Windy City.;5;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2028;9/2/2011;CKNuLvhd7zo33D23b;HMQ7mMGMhyDanHiYRqND3g;This is one of my favorite places to stay while in Chicago. The service is always superb- friendly, warm and most importantly, helpful throughout the whole stay. They especially treat their platinum members with additional care and make certain that all needs and requests are met. The rooms are better than average. I do feel they could update their bathrooms to make them a bit larger, but the two bed suite or kind bed suites are always spacious and great. The staff is lovely and other than some of the housekeepers being a bit rude, I find this hotel to be luxurious and wonderful for a short stay!;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2029;8/29/2011;ZRTdnsGPKlvRmauTqmSPhg;Jl0VYhwpGb1lwWGIRrPmMg;I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency for five nights while attending a conference at the hotel. The good: - The hotel was clean, the room was nice and surprisingly quiet, with great views - Great location. Minutes to Millennium Park and the Loop. The bad: - Internet costs $14/day, and even if you pay for it, it doesn't work on the levels where the conference is being held. Ridiculous. No, ridiculous isn't a strong enough word, but I don't think Yelp allows me to use stronger language.  Because the conference rooms were all in the basement levels, cellphone and 4G service for your laptops/tablets was also sketchy at best. - I never ate at any of the hotel restaurants, but I did eat food provided at conference functions, and was thoroughly underwhelmed by all of it. - The Hyatt is currently having a labor dispute with the housekeeping staff. If it makes you feel uncomfortable to walk past picketing workers, or to support a company that doesn't properly compensate their workers, you might not want to stay here (my room was booked before I was made aware of the labor dispute).;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2030;2/12/2011;a5C0lUO4RF5wIMVeoDsDUg;3o63BKb1fKcM_WUU9XMRJw;I come to Chicago for work frequently and typically stay at the McCormick Place Hyatt but they were all booked up for my travel date. I got a reasonably priced room at this location and was quite pleased. Pros: Extremely helpful, attentive, and friendly staff Excellent room service Clean room Comfortable bed Beautifully designed and appointed bathrooms Cons: This hotel is like a labyrinth in terms of layout where the front desk is on the second floor. The room I was put in is smaller than any of the other ones I've stayed in at the McCormick Place location. I'm not a fan of their toiletry products -- I wish they would upgrade them to a more luxurious brand, and while this isn't exactly a dealbreaker, it would increase my love of the Hyatt brand if they stepped it up a bit in this department. I was in the West Tower and had a bizarre view of an office building -- I could see in to their offices and they could see in to my room! But actually, it was fairly interesting...it must be some kind of advertising or creative media floor because it was quite good people watching and there were all manner of visual oddities to ponder (for example, a giant stuffed winnie-the-pooh bear in the middle of one of their hallways that stayed put my whole visit).;4;1;0;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2031;7/21/2008;iju8DcFzNpBcNPQvQ0j1zA;yubAVY-SZckvAuuT_ac61A;I wouldn't normally give a giant, convention-crazed mega hotel a 5 star review, but the Regency Hyatt gets one and here is why: So in order to get to the incredibly small regional airport that services my hometown - I must inevitably fly through one of 4 cities: Dallas, Cincinnati, Atlanta or Chicago. I try to avoid Chicago at all costs. O'Hare is a nightmare and something ALWAYS goes wrong when I fly through. Well this trip was no different. One canceled flight later, I was on my way to the Regency Hyatt in the Loop - I mean, come on, I'm not going to stay at the airport. I got the room at an absolute steal on Priceline (the airlines don't pay for anything nowadays - but that is another review). When I arrived I was dubious to say the least. This place is huge - frickin HUGE. I prefer the boutique route, but whatever it was cheap and I was only going to be there one night. As I checked in, I made small talk with the desk attendant, Gabrielle. I was just talking about my flight being canceled and the nightmare of getting downtown on public transportation because of construction, etc. Not really bitching - just talking. Well - the fabulous Gabrielle - informed me that she was upgrading me to a suite and then proceeded to give me a voucher for free room service and 2 free drinks in the bar! I told her that was absolutely not necessary, but she insisted. The suite was phenomenal with a beautiful view of the river on one side and the lake on the other - did I mention it was a corner suite? :) That is really some amazing service. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will stay again. thanks, Gabrielle!;5;6;8;3;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2032;9/22/2009;0ArCyNdxtnfjwTnvBsT8jA;KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g;I thought this was a decent hotel for a first time visit to Chicago. Like just with everyone else, you can get a pretty good rate via Priceline. Despite all the numerous conventions and events going on, they still need to fill up those vacant rooms. Of course if I had to choose on my next visit to the Windy City, I would choose another hotel just for a different experience. Check-in was nice and easy. The lady helping us was pleasant enough. But before I could even request a bigger room or a nicer view, we were quickly handed the keys. They probably have a big red sign flashing in red on their computer screen saying "casual tourists, not corporate accounts." I asked if we could get access to the Regency Club for the free breakfast daily, that got shot down. Extra $75. No thanks. Our room was no-frills, with a nice big view of an office building. Big flat screen TV and a comfortable bed, that's pretty much all we need. The walls are as thin as tissue paper, as you can hear people flushing the toilet, sneezing, or talking in the hallway. No fridge, no free Wi-Fi, or any other "luxury" amenities. Safe to say, I wouldn't pay anywhere near the standard rates listed on their website. Priceline prices, yeah it's about right. Maybe even a little less. Of course, the biggest advantage with this hotel is the location. We stayed in the West tower, so the elevator conveniently spits you out to Wacker street and you're on your way. It's centrally located, so you can either go north to Magnificent Mile or south to the Loop, where there is Millenium Park, Willis Tower, Art Institute, etc. Plus, it's close to all the bus and train stations. Oh, and the workout room isn't too shabby either. Gotta work off all that deep dish pizza somehow.;3;6;4;5;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2033;7/6/2008;CdQIDKHbgzNZ5lZdcHjQBA;rQrqrb5dFztAeFYwyqbygA;One of my closest friends was visiting and stayed at this hotel. I ended up drinking a little (or a lot) too much and crashed here for the night. I think this is a great hotel for families visiting Chicago. It's not trendy or hip, but the lobby of the hotel is grand and a great presentation. Plenty of snack and food options in the lobby area... I almost felt like I was attending a convention as I walked through the lobby in my party dress and fancy shoes. The rooms are very comfortable. They are pretty standard and a bit boring, but have great views of the city. The bath amenities are nothing special. The bed is SUPER comfortable. For a standard size room, it was pretty big. There was a little sofa and a chair. The television was huge.;3;6;5;3;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2034;11/3/2009;ljxlwjF-Xgg1XCvXo33Krg;RgotWt-6_53vAkQfIc81Dw;The Hyatt Regency was perfect for our stay in the Windy City. You can't beat the location. Tons of convention people stay here, so be prepared for large groups of people walking around wearing name tags at all hours. The room we stayed in had a great view of the river and Lake Michigan. We were surprised by a fireworks show out the window Saturday night. The decor was modern, yet comfortable. If you are hungry or thirsty, there are plenty of options for food and drink in the hotel 24 hours a day. There's even a snack stand open all the time selling cappuccinos, pastries, picnic supplies, bulk candy, and cold drinks. Check in at the front desk was easy, and we were assisted with automated check out when we departed. The concierge desk was helpful with directions, plus we were able to print our boarding passes from the computers set up there. I only wish they had free wifi in the rooms. But other than that, the Hyatt Regency had everything we could possibly want in a downtown hotel.;4;6;5;3;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Of course I took it with me and I always get complements on its smell...then I have to break the news that I 'stole' it from the Hyatt downtown. All in all, the bedrooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel is in a good Central location, and they have a flipping club on the main level.

Also, parking is super expensive here and took us nearly 1.5 hours just to get our car out of the parking spot.  Look around for other public parking lots and park there for half the cost of parking at the Hyatt.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2038;1/10/2007;e1Dbe0l2jXFEpF1UdsMBxQ;vIHCUJSkc-tccj6wHFPxwg;I like this hotel. Ive stayed there twice even though i live in the city. But you really have to bargain at the front desk for a good room. The first time i stayed there the room was huge, one wall was all floor to ceiling windows, facing north, with the most breathtaking view. The second time i stayed there, for the nye party the other week, we got stuck in a small room, facing east, with a small window and an "ok" view. They also didnt honor our request for a smoking room, and had a note on the desk saying there would be a $250 cleaning charge for smoking. But, they are decorated very nice, and the staff at the desk is really nice and patient too. wouldnt go back for the nye party though- it was so huge i spent the whole time walking around trying to find people.;4;3;2;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2039;3/5/2011;uH0jXXotrK398Cr-du2tNg;jJOBopqF-DOF3eJED-ffwg;You can't get a room cheaper than at the Hyatt in Chicago. The location was pretty convenient- pretty much a block away from Michigan Ave. This place is huge. Everyone has conventions here, so it's always packed. It's an older hotel, too, so it feels kind of grungy. There are two buildings. The rooms are fine. It's got what you need and relatively comfortable. The shampoo/conditioner is pretty terrible though- no surprise there. One thing I found really weird was that they have machines for quick check-in/check-out. I thought hotels were supposed to be all about service, so it was strange that they purposely set it up so that we didn't talk to an employee during our entire stay.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2040;7/17/2009;w9qTkzVm050yDVmaCw94Tw;dIr0V_YxSVhcTuDiqiTCig;This is a convention galore hotel.  It's impersonal, but for $65/night with a view, I'm not complaining!  I got lucky with the view.  The spacious room was probably bigger than a studio rental in SF.  The king size bed was so comfy that I actually ended up sleeping in until 11 am some days!  The Hyatt is conveniently located near the El trains and buses, which makes it easy to get around.  It neighbors many of the tourist's attractions:  Millennium Park, Navy Pier. the Magnificent Mile, etc... The Hyatt's lobby is beautifully laid out with a dining area encircle by a zen-like pond with delicately "spitting" waterfalls.  You can watch t.v. while waiting or just relaxing on the many sofas and chairs.  Their bar offers a stunning backdrop view of the city.   Once again, this is a hotel with lots of conventions so to get from point A to B, may take 10 mins, but the majority of all convention hotels are like that.  The difference is that you get a lovely view on your way there. Tip:  Purchase the unlimited transit passes.  DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR into Chicago.  Chicago has one of the best public transit systems that I've experienced.  Besides, it'll cost you at least $40 or more to park your car overnight at the hotels. I'm in love with Chicago, will have to visit soon!;4;3;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2041;7/12/2010;VrJRT9d0gu;6bfcLLL35DpsxAxxk5ZNAQ;Waiting in line to get my room. Got a top floor room. King bed with the desk behind the bed so I could work on my laptop and see the TV at the same time. Nice room and comfy bed.  The only thing that freaked me out was upon settling in, I opened my 34th floor window to see my view only to find no less than 3 HUGE spiders hanging out outside and many, many egg sacks in the creases. Who knew bugs made it up that far a building. I wonder if they have ever been down the building or if they just live their whole lives up there swaying in the breeze.;4;2;2;2;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Flat screen TV, tons of AC 4. Clean sheet, downy comforters, softest pillows Cons: 1. No free WIFI 2. No roll away beds 3. Shampoo kinda sucks 4. They charge for everything along the way All in all, Hotels rule, but it's not really my style. I prefer the couch or the floor. I actually slept on the floor at the Hyatt.

2043;7/6/2010;6ryRJh9ViFVVjp2LuOwcIg;qExR8NN0q7PZBQpNOL_VZw;Pretty sweet digs. I learned on my bus tour that this hotel has the LONGEST bar, interesting. I shared a double room and I found it to be super comfortable. My bed and pillows were comfy. Except those decorative pillows. Those are gross, I pushed them off immediately. I appreciated the curved shower rod which made the tub seem larger. I did not appreciate the ill flushing toilet. Also, 26 floors up and you would think I'd get awesome cell reception, but no. Living within concrete walls for a long weekend did not please my phone. Concierge was helpful, elevator was pretty fast, as long as you weren't stopping on every floor. Hairdryer is found in a black bag hanging in the closet, if you seemed to miss it in the bathroom. Careful though, my friend blew the circuits using it on high and was without power for 30 minutes. I liked the ipod doc, nice touch. Made our preparties a bit more lively. The LCD tv was in theory a good idea, but jeez, the picture on mine looked like I was looking through a fishbowl. Housekeeping knocked on my door at 9am each morning so boo to that. Otherwise, great place for a stay. :);4;3;1;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2044;2/17/2007;zuZ7uHdoZcj6AvHOKAxyJA;6xzTqv7bDL-hKm37_wwKwg;It's rare that I'll give a hotel 5 stars. To be quite honest, I probably wouldn't give them that fifth star, if it weren't for the following situation: Last Thursday, I came down with the flu. I was planning on staying at my apartment, but my landlord still hadn't left for Singapore. I went back to the Hyatt after making new reservations. The concierge (who, at this point recognised me by sight because I've slept in their bed more than I did in my New York apartment) took one look at me and asked me if I needed some medication. I got to my room, and within five minutes, he'd personally brought up Tylenol, because he didn't want to have the usual 5-10min delay that would happen if he had housekeeping do it. Yes, he got a nice letter written for him afterwards :) Another story: 2 colleagues and I were staying at this hotel. Since I was staying longer (did I mention I spent more nights in the Hyatt than I did anywhere else this month?) than them, we were on separate reservations. They screwed up their room -- they gave them what is basically a party suite -- one bed in one room and the other room had bunch of couches with a pull-out bed. They were upgraded immediately to the executive floor, with zero hassles. I guess they wanted to keep our hotwire.com-based business :) To be fair, the rooms are slightly dated -- no LCD TVs, lacking iPod docks in every room, etc. Even the executive floor (don't know about the suites) look a little dated, though they are nicer. The beds are comfortable, though, and the view can be great if you're lucky -- either to Millenium Park or towards the Maginificent Mile.;5;2;2;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2045;4/5/2010;kZ8GukOinYkS6KAVW6paGg;ZQYNombDho1PYfnEWFZevw;3.5 stars. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago on Saturday night after getting it on Priceline for $55/night. The hotel is in a very good location with plenty to walk to right near it. If you are coming from Midway Airport, I highly recommend taking the train. It's about 30 minutes, $2.25, and less than a 10 minute walk from the Randolph/Wabash station (we found this to be the more convenient station to the hotel rather than the Lake/State Street one). Even though we got to the hotel at 11 am, we were able to check in and go to our room on the 32nd floor. The room itself was a pretty basic king bed room, but we didn't need anything fancy or special for one night. I did find the placement of the flat screen TV a bit odd as it was on the end of the dresser on the right side of the bed, so if were laying in bed, you could to be on your side to see it. For booking via Priceline, we actually had a room with a decent view. The only amenity we utilized at the hotel was the business center which is on the bottom level. Use of the internet for 15 minutes will run you $7.56 and printing one page will cost $0.83. So only use the business center if you really have to. If you want to use cabs to get around, there are plenty in queue all the time near the hotel, so you won't have to wait to get one. Overall, this hotel is not a bad option especially since it looks like it's pretty easy to book for a great price on Priceline.;3;2;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2046;1/8/2007;EKV71bNlMiIM5MMrUwS0wg;wkMerj3FWjl4iDrleIt16Q;Hotel is nice, great location, contemporary rooms. I have a couple complaints:The staff sucks something awful: Check in was a nightmare, I requested a smoking room with a king bed. I ended up with a non-smoking room with a double bed. I called the front desk with a question regarding the NYE party I was attending and got major attitude from an irritated front desk clerk. Expected more from a hotel on the mag mile.;3;1;3;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2047;10/12/2008;I5j;wzyAH2F7kvh7Mnd_cSfv8A;The hotel room was big and comfortable.  The beds were incredibly comfortable.  I always fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.  Great view of lake Michigan.  The service was wonderful and the concierge people were very knowledgeable and friendly.   Also, it was nice knowing that there was always a line of cabs waiting right out front in case you needed to go somewhere in a hurry.   Only downside is there's no free wifi.;4;2;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2048;12/21/2006;4ttzCxwdgIRsHjwMa1oGWg;0GiY7LonmKGuEgCtdd0DmA;I got a sweet deal on Priceline for this hotel - it cost me the same to stay here as it would have if I'd stayed at the lowest priced hotel in the standard travel websites.  My friends had similar experience, too.  It's totally worth it if you get the priceline amount so bid low and pick that geographic area. It was fairly central for me for work so not a bad experience at all.  They put me in a suite that really was great and comfy, albeit a tad small.   Any hotel that charges for internet access in this day is a little lame in my book though -- especially considering what it normally costs to stay here.;4;2;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2049;10/14/2007;Jdk77uHg48p9UDLWBV2i8A;QlVQozUW06_hOwo_13oaEw;I think the location is a huge perk for this place.  Great access to the Mag Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, beautiful views along the river of classic Chicago landmarks...Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower, etc. Our room was nicely appointed...contemporary and clean, plus they feature plasma TVs, and ipod alarm clock, so that ups the cool factor. We stayed in the West wing, which was a blessing because a convention was throwing a rager in the atrium, and from what other reviewers have said, Big Bar can get noisy as well.  If you stay here, I might recommend requesting a room in this wing.;4;2;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2050;7/7/2011;A29sEBTFFcQy1JDpCNIENQ;PbjMcOBmaucv9KuJZRjFNw;Every time I spotted a hotel employee, they were always smiling. It's clear that they enjoy making their guests happy. Check-in was easy and quick. It seems as though they don't treat their Priceline customers different than any of their other customers (which is a good thing!) Being on the North end of the loop, the location was great. It was steps away from Michigan Avenue, and a couple of blocks away from State Street. The view from the room was grand, facing the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower. The bed was very comfortable. There was actually a bathtub in the bathroom, which comes in handy after a long day of walking around. The lobby was both busy and beautiful. There was a great selection of food inside the hotel. It's reminiscent of a Vegas hotel (sans casino). I will definitely stay here again when I visit Chicago. At their price range, Hyantt Regency definitely goes above and beyond of what's expected from them.;5;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2051;4/22/2010;P04yOjy5-3wkkvahCNXaGg;05kZaCA4CvscY82HG6xTFA;This hotel should be used only for business/conference type events cause I don't think it will satisfy any of the needs of a casual traveler. I stayed here 1 night, and my experience kinda blew. I was supposedly being "upgraded" to a better room because I have status with Hyatt, but if the room I got was my upgrade, i'd HATE to see what my original room looked like. Small, uncomfortable, sterile, uninviting setting throughout the hotel. The main lobby is actually very appeasing to the eyes, with waterfalls and high ceilings. The service was decent, and I have no complaints here. If you're looking for a hotel to relax at, this isn't the spot. Its loud and busy typically, with business people and conventioners.;3;1;1;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2052;1/20/2009;pmigh0yzDyrH7oOwW3jVEg;6fELAdrPxMZVcx7i4tsrUw;Dump. This is the most feared type of downtown lodging on earth: the convention hotel. It's actually just fine if you're looking to encounter wild packs of dry humping, married business men in town for the Dunder Mifflin paper expo.  But if you're not, you may want to steer clear of this place.  I accidentally stayed (well, entered the room and left) here after booking on Hotwire and our room looked and smelled like Amy Winehouse just checked out of it.  I should note, however, that the valet and bellmen were friendly and professional. The irony is that it's just as expensive as the nearby Conrad (Hilton family) or Intercontinental which are great places to stay. Another incredible pain in the ass was check in.  Two front desk people were chatting, another was behind the counter and yet they insisted I use the kiosk to check in.  It was a pain to say the least.  Then when we came back downstairs to checkout they seemed really offended by it and were pretty rude about it all.;1;1;0;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2053;7/16/2009;qtfHfr8ceQ0TmnPHQ8LX7w;KuckdzFLj1kMKOPX1SPlIQ;The Hyatt is a nice hotel.  The setup is a bit strange.  We stayed in the west tower and we came to find most of the amenities in the east tower.  So that was a minor inconvenience.  Some of the amenities that were in the east tower that we used/ visited were the big bar, the bistro at 151, Stay Fit fitness center, J's Express, and the gift shop.  Essentially all of the amenities we used. The room was nice.  The only annoying thing about the room was the lighting.  There was no centralized lighting.  The staff was very nice and courteous. Would we stay again? Probably not, because there are so many other nice hotels in Downtown Chicago that we have yet to try.  By no means is this a knock of the Hyatt.;3;1;0;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2054;6/14/2007;3Yk8jV7S7vkQ0wOKvIDKfA;nShq32BVmWcDvLVz6EDbkw;Big, big, big. I don't typically stay at super hotels like this, and I tend to like a bit more personality in my lodgings, but this Hyatt is perfectly comfortable and acceptably furnished with comfy beds, standard amenities, and some decent views if you're in the right rooms. Staff service is generally good, though when a convention comes in, it can slip a bit, thanks to all the demands made on their time. Both times I have been in this hotel, though, there have been conventions, and service quality remained fairly high. Big Bar is passable, though not terribly exciting. The club/dancefloor space was rather popular when I stayed, but I wouldn't want to spend any time on the lower floors on club nights--it is tremendously loud. All in all a solid option for a short stay.;3;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2055;7/27/2007;KN2GrMnNm;Hj8XSXWjcvuz7dE7udjnvg;I will preface this by saying that Hyatt is my favorite big-chain hotel property.  They seem to consistently deliver from town to town, with a clean, modern feel that extends from the rooms to the common areas.  I think that the fact that there are almost always herds of middle aged conventioneers adds an invigorating buzz to the atmosphere, but if you don't like them, its not too hard to avoid by going directly to your room.  I don't think the exercise room gets too busy either because these folks are preoccupied with getting their drink on and "working the crowd" (interpret that however you'd like). This Hyatt is particularly interesting because you can access the weird  miniworld that exists underneath the buildings in this area (offices, predominately).  So if the weather is bad out, you might be able to find a few places open during business hours.  I somehow stumbled into it one night and it was a bit eerie because everything was closed, but still lit up and walkable.  Sorta like the mall equivalent of a ghost town.  I find it a bit odd that no one else has mentioned it, so maybe I imagined the whole thing.  Spoooooky.... PS - the small Italian restaurant located in the hotel is surprisingly good - not your average overpriced, mooch off the expense account kind of place you'd expect in a large hotel.  A good soup and salad bar, and good portions of tasty pasta too.;5;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2056;7/28/2009;wdP4BAU88HwhpBj3-gPnww;X9P0fzm9LiNrIzLr08Lv-w;I booked this hotel on Priceline for only $70 per night, much better than the $219 that was posted on their website for the time we were staying. The hotel is a convention center, with a huge lobby and separate elevator banks depending on the floor you're at. It's located directly downtown, close to a myriad of amenities. As usual, hotel food is very expensive, so go outside to get a better price. And overall if you're going to stay in downtown Chicago, leave your car at home! It's extremely expensive to park there. Overall, hotel and room were clean and we received quick service. I would highly recommend the Hyatt for a downtown Chicago stay.;4;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2057;9/23/2009;XBKMlQqlNG;p13DOmhjd28jgUmhgWgcUw;Not the best Hyatt I've ever stayed at. It is at a good location, on the water and right by Michigan Ave but the rooms were not impressive at all.  The bar and restaurant areas were really nice though, so that's a plus.

It's more like "There are 500 kids running all over the place and I want to die" kind of way. Outside of the completly cheap and cheesy lobby, the rooms are totally meh. The wireless internet costs $15 a day and is SO SLOW. Don't even bother getting it, you are better off checking your email on your cell phone. If you have a choice don't stay here, there are many other better hotels around the same price that are on or near Michigan AVE (Raffello for example).;2;2;0;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Could hear people coming in and out of their rooms but never heard any voices, etc. Showers had excellent water pressure. The food: Got drinks at Big Bar (Not too impressed), dinner and drinks at the Irish pub (service was excellent, food so-so). Starbucks at the coffee shop was $$$ but didn't expect much different.

2066;3/25/2010;Fc2TigSPiTzCPBDYV288mA;uW2T6YxYxX527ZmLUEta4A;I booked a room at the Hyatt for my girlfriend's birthday.  Even though we're from Chicago and we actually don't live that far away from the Hyatt, I still thought it'd be a nice thing to do.  And of course, I could partly be blame for the room, because in general, Priceline has been consistent in giving me high quality hotels.  For example, I got a stay at the Fairmont last year and for the most part, that hotel was fantastic.   The Hyatt though?  For the price that I paid, it was nothing spectacular.  For the price that I paid + having to listen to cars and trucks rumble along lower Wacker/Columbus for the night?  Absolutely horrid.  I'll try to point out some of the highlights and shortcomings here - categorically, per usual. Location: 5 out of 5 Can't really beat it if you're a tourist.  Conveniently located and within walking distance to multiple attractions.  Cabs and shuttles know where it is too so if you're flying in, you won't be stuck trying to explain where it is. Customer Service: 3 out of 5 Caveat here.  You know who the friendliest people were at this hotel?  The people working the front door either greeting guests as they arrived, or hailing the cabs.   I really didn't get a good feel from anyone else working at the hotel.  They all seemed preoccupied with something else, and honestly, I really didn't care since it was only for one night.   Even the automatic check in kiosk was disappointing.  I ALWAYS go for the kiosks if they're available because it saves me time and I don't have to wait for any doofuses.  This kiosk though - wow, slow as dirt.  It may be the one time when checking in with the actual people behind the desk would have been faster.  Anyway. Quality of Room: 3 out of 5 No real complaints - spacious, comfortable, boutique'ish toiletries.  Like I mentioned earlier, if you get stuck facing the wrong way, you'll hearing cars and trucks rumbling throughout the night.  Since I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, I didn't notice it too much, but if you're trying to watch TV, it can be a real pain in the ass. Price: 3 out of 5 Sure, I Priceline'd it, but honestly, I expected just a little bit more than what was offered.  Before you comment and say, "It's a great hotel, look at all the amenities!" hear me out.  When you really strip away everything that overwhelms you when you first walk in and look at it piecewise instead of as one big picture - you'll be underwhelmed.  Glass ceilings, little pond with fountains, an "open aired" dining area, the escalators - get past all of that and when you do, the hotel becomes above average and not any more than that. Overall: 3 out of 5 I guess bidders can't be choosers.  Not a terrible hotel, but not really anything to write home about either.  Unless you're here on yelp.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2067;6/16/2010;znV5GvxlWUv9YQ3QHqYfHA;z96eQlEDrQVvxtKyymwTLg;I like this place. Great location, nice room, great bar. We stayed here during our first visit in Chicago a few years ago... The bar is impressive - you are warned on the large/group martini glasses :-) I am keeping the fifth star, because of their water conservation efforts. I appreciate their efforts, but I had specifically asked that they change the sheets after two days of our stay there, which they didn't. I called again and asked for the housekeeping to come back and change the sheets when we got back from the sightseeing, and they did so promptly. I say, when someone pays $180 a night to stay here, they deserve to sleep on clean sheets. There are planty of ways to be nice to mother nature...;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2068;7/27/2010;rBXAAhydG-0Q;B5mpfVCviyUl9Bsdef5jUQ;Hyatt's usually don't let me down...but, this one has sort of (2 stars means that I've experience better). The check in woman was kind, helpful and let me check in early (1030am woo hoo!).  That's nice...we all have early flights time to time and just want to put our bags away.  Nice...also there was a big bag storage area, so if they didn't have a room, I could've stored my bag (not sure if there was a fee or not though). But after getting to my room...it was very underwhelming.  The room is quite small, less than 200 sqft.  The room is also unusually dark, I need a light on during the afternoon!  The desk is right next to the bed and the tv is on the same desk...get the feeling of cramped-ness yet?  The bathroom is nicely appointed and quite large (probably half the room size!).   The 2 stars is in comparison to other Hyatts I've stayed at (NYC, New Brunswick NJ, Phoenix, Albuquerque, etc...I've been to many Hyatts) and this one is probably the second worst.  The atrium is beautiful at least, so I guess leaving my room for that is an upgrade.  If staying in this part of town, I'd say to stay at the Swissotel down the street.  A bit further, but it was nicer there than here.  Maybe the other rooms here are nicer, but i can't give reviews based on assumptions and maybes.;2;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2070;11/10/2011;Mq86RuWkOJDNpnVbJkkc4A;TmArrTnDeSWE1cmtntQMsw;I enjoyed my stay here (September 2011). The view from our room was jaw dropping. It was right across the street from the river and Magnificent Mile. So many sites and sounds of Chicago right at my fingertips. The parking was a bit hard to find and expensive, but other than that, no other complaints. Oh yeah, SUPER COMFORTABLE bed! Also, great curtains that kept the room nice and dark to help me sleep in. Oh, I think the price was around $125 a night for Sunday-Tuesday.;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2071;12/11/2010;RbSRHcw3uLLE-sf0twS1aA;Qzj25vBqVuA33rno0Sl6DA;Priceline sent us here when we booked through Priceline (name your own price) and this stay was definitely worth it!  Though the sheer size of this place is enough to make you feel like a small fish (2100 rooms, what?!) the room we stayed in was quite large and spacious.   Linens were clean and crisp, beds were comfortable and downy, and our room was SUPER quiet and dark.  Granted, we were in the west wing, and had a nice view into the neighboring business high rise.  If you're like me, you'll spend half your time in the morning watching all the people laboring away, and be glad you're not them.   The staff was very helpful and the woman at the check in counter supplied me with a map and a detailed list of neighboring parking garages.  Valet is 50 dollars here.  Though the thought of unlimited in/out privileges is appealing, spare yourself a bunch of cash and park at one of the other spots.  Millennium garage, directly behind Hyatt and next to the little grocery store, is 30/overnight.  Its indoor, clean, and safe!  There are reduced rates for being there 12 hours or less. The hotel is also located very close to the infamous Michigan Avenue, where you will find the art museum, millennium park, numerous fancy-pants boutiques and stores.  Plenty of sights to see, lots of people to watch, and just a quick walk back to your room. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.;4;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2073;3/4/2009;qoOkO2ul8nCUMsLGpxCleA;-XM94NttmJuZZQGXjr_F4g;I got this room off of priceline for $80.  It was right on Michigan, which I loved.  Yes it is a convention hotel but it was still pretty inside, with lots at your fingertips, including on site restaurants, coffee shops and souvenier shops.   The staff was all incredibly helpful and very nice.  WE called down to them for recommendations about 4-5 times and had great ideas each time... The room was very clean and very nice, high thread count linens and plush towels. They even helped my boy plan a romantic little setup in the room for me (rose petals, a vase of tulips, wine and chocolate covered strawberries)! We got a room at the end of the hallway, which was nice as well.  the only downside was that I could hear the VERY loud girls across the hall all night.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2077;4/14/2009;X4Z4fIh4JISq3cypwlxqSA;BKRnVgocUSlBJTbR9Elulg;This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means. Incompetent service. Hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday. Elevators were very slow, waited 10 minutes on any given event. Red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night. Used my stay toward NW airlines bonus points. Bar was ok. One cup coffee service was awful. No free wireless and no free cable channels. Fridge was 25 bucks a day to use. With http://hotels.com res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect.?....

2079;9/6/2011;kGEp;XVijwtIS35MBtdvFNj8lbw;First the good: 1. Great location. Very close to Michigan Ave, where all the stores & restaurants are, and the river. It's a beautiful walk from this hotel to the river and other locations. Navy pier is a 20 minute walk. 2. The hotel is huge, could be a plus or minus for some, for me it didn't make a difference. 3. Extremely nice staff at check in 4. River view if you are on a high floor and if you get a room with a view (duh) 5. Could be great value if you get a low rate The bad: 1.  The person who designed the lay out of the bathroom should be fired. The toilet paper holder (w/ the toilet paper naturally) was behind the toilet. That was really annoying as you can imagine. The water pressure was bad. They had a curtain instead of a glass door in the shower. The sink was not comfortable to use. 2. Parking was extremely expensive - $50 per night. 3. No refrigerator. If you open the mini bar and take something out, even without opening it, you get charged because the bar is activated by a motion sensor. 4. Kind of felt like they nickled and dimed you for everything. 5. Bad TV channels, nothing to watch, no HBO. 6. The coffee shop down stairs was expensive, but I guess it's not the hotel's fault. 7. No pool. Overall, I am not sure if  I would have stayed here over another similar hotel in the same price range, but if the price was low I would stay here just because the location is so great. Tip: "like" their FB page and you could get discounts for the room and/or parking and you can even make requests.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2080;9/5/2011;veb;Bb6hxTbneXoNzz9nD9Lkjw;I booked this hotel through Priceline's name your own price. The hotel is in a very convenient location. Right next to the water and not right in the middle of downtown were traffic can be congested. Our room was on the 26th floor and had a great view. They had a floating bed which was pretty cool. There was a convenient bar/restaurant in the hotel. The food was decent as well as the drinks. The bad. There was no bed cover sheet on our bed. It was simply a regular sheet that was tucked in. For someone who moves around while he sleeps, the bottom sheet constantly came undone and was exposing the bare mattress. Not very comfortable. The room size was a little small as well. As soon as I walked in, the doorway was narrow and there wasn't much room to maneuver around. Also, the walls were very thin so we could hear everything from our neighbors on both sides. Overall, this hotel was decent. Again, for the money, it wasn't a bad selection. However, I don't think I would want to stay there again.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2081;12/29/2008;UwnZ5PxKfB4h;EQS0tIRTtxwtDa-PA3Yl1g;Where do I start??? So bad I couldn't even give it a star!! But forced to in order to complete this review! Check in was fine, they did allow us to check in early. I requested a non-smoking room.   I had gone online to use their concierge service which is supposed to be an easier way to request amenities.  We went to Chicago to celebrate my mom's 67th birthday so it as supposed to be an amazing experience! I ordered my mom a fruit basket for one of her surprises which she never got even after ordering it twice.  However, concierge did send her wine with chocolates for her birthday. And after the 2nd non receipt of my amenity for my mom they sent us three apples with a card congratulating me for my birthday! (rolls eyes) Before arriving to Chicago, I sent a request for dinner reservations at a great Mexican restaurant I got a phone call that their restaurants would be closed!! What the hell kind of shit is that? You are a hotel you don't close shit down when you have hotel guests in your hotel!! Ok fine the concierge was supposed to book me a reservation for 2 on my mom's birthday which was on the 24th of December, so I get a phone call from Dwayne saying that a lot of places were closed but he would try to find a place that was open.   I had checked with the concierge and that is when I found out that their restaurant was closed and that they had gotten us a reservation at Mexx. So we settled in and got ready for dinner.  We had a great dinner. However they had us down for dinner on Christmas day??!! Hmm...  Someone messed that up! Go figure! As with any information obtained from the concierge it was misinformation after misinformation! From where to find free Wi-Fi to where I could find some soul food!!  I was also told that I could not find food after midnight and that my only option was room service or the deli down in the lobby.  I didn't want either of those options! Pissed I called the front desk and told her that I wanted to transfer the room to my mom because I wanted to check out, she tried to counter act the misinformation about food access by telling me that there was definitely places that deliver to the hotel up until 5am but didn't seem phased that I wanted to leave.  Made me feel swell!!!!! Thank god I know people who live there and from there or I would have been stuck. The Room... We booked through Priceline. So I didn't pay that much per night, had I paid more I would have demanded a refund!!  It reeked of cigarette smoke and it took 2 days to go away.  The room had dust that covered some parts of the room was so thick I could write in it! The bathroom had chipped tile, a broken tub drain, and a loose screw that held the curtain rod to its hinges.   A little advice read all hotel reviews:call the hotel in advance to make sure they are 100% before booking!! And if you are unhappy with your room no matter how much you pay for it speak to a manger. I just don't understand why this hotel received 4 stars!!! It so does not deserve it.  The whole staff had no way to compensate for their lack of customer service skills and or their screw ups.  I didn't cause a scene because of my mom. Rest assured we won't ever stay in a Hyatt.  Priceline should know when a hotel is not 100% operational or is undergoing construction which is one of the excuses I heard from the front desk as to why there were putting us in a tower across the street.;1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2082;7/6/2010;C1RTXQoru6SX7pHqGnCDzQ;SD27ygPcDohKT7eyux6gsQ;This hotel is crap. I've stayed here twice and both stays were less than impressive. The sad part is that the owners of Hyatt live in Chicago, so you'd think they would put more effort into this property but we have nicer Hyatt's in Colorado. I've stayed in a lot of the hotels around Michigan Ave and usually don't feel the need to write a review but last night's stay was ridiculous. The weather has been pretty brutal in Chicago and my apartment does not have central air, so I thought I would treat myself to a hotel for the night. Well I used Hotwire hoping I would get anything but this place, but that did not happen. I showed up around midnight because my girlfriend and I had been to the movies. Now I find sometimes if you get a really laid back night shift crew, they won't make you put down a credit card. I mean it's already midnight and checkout is at noon, why fill out more paperwork and hassle me with having to check that the "authorization" drops off. Well I guess this place thinks they're the W because they would not budge on a $50 authorization. $50 bucks!!! Even if I rockstar trashed the room, I'm so sure the $50 would cover it all. Oh well I let them authorize for $50 even though my room was pre-paid and then got offered a queen bed. Not okay. I can sleep on a king at home, I'm not paying to sleep on a queen. We finally compromise with a king on a smoking floor. I then asked if they knew of any late-night delivery open because I did not have my laptop to Grubhub something. The dude hands me a Sarpino's menu. WOW! The room was just what I had expected. Paper thin walls, rock hard bed and no wine glasses(just paper cups). Yeah, we got the longest bar in the country and you can't put real glasses in the room. To top it off, housekeeping woke me up at noon even though the privacy sign was up and the front desk said if I wanted to stay till 3 PM it would be 1/2 a night in price. No thank you! Do yourself a favor and skip on this place. The W, the Dana and even the Hotel Felix are better than this dump.;1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Not far from the train, and in walk able distance to a lot of attractions. We walked from here to the Taste of Chicago, as well as up and down Michigan Ave! It's very big, I believe they have two separate towers with a really nice bar and restaurant. Check in was fast and the rooms were clean. The cleaning lady did come at an odd time, but I guess she probably started or ended with our rooms.  Elevators are a bit slow but what do you expect with the number of floors. Overall I was very happy with my stay here!;5;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

I liked the iPod/iPhone speaker/charger dock. The bathroom was very nice, with a large edge-lit mirror that made it seem really upscale. My room had a safe and a mini-bar fridge. The TV was a decent LCD but the channels took forever to change there wasn't much variety. It felt like a 2011 TV with 1992 cable. It looks like all rooms offer a great view. The location is fantastic with lots nearby, including Navy Pier. There are two towers so make sure to go to the main entrance to check in (east tower).

2085;9/3/2011;IO1GQ--JbcgSGurtBsydDQ;ZBo6qleidHe4-y9wONquAQ;There was trash in the room when we came in...a bunch of paper and bags stuffed behind the chair in the corner.  When we first called down to tell the front desk, we were put on hold for several minutes and had to call back.  Finally did get a hold of someone.  We went for a walk and when we returned, some of the trash had been cleaned up, but there was still paper stuffed behind the chair (even though we had told the front desk that that was where the trash was).   On top of this, the room we were given was the ADA-compliant room, which we were told was our only option if we wanted a king bed.  It was very clear that this hotel 'phoned-in' conversion of this room for ADA-compliance:many of the fixtures were poorly converted or useless, regardless of one's ability status.   For example, the bathroom sink was incredibly small and shallow.  More the size of a sink in an RV than a full bathroom.   Instead of installing ADA-compliant towel racks, there were simply no towels in the bathroom.  It really was unpleasant to step out of the shower and realize that you have to walk out into the bedroom and into the closet to get a bath towel.   Annoyingly, the room's security latch was installed at the same height as the main light switch.  When the latch was unlocked, it covered the light switch.  The was very frustrating when coming into a dark room for the evening and having to fumble behind the latch to get to the switch. The overall ambiance of the hotel lobby felt more like a mall food court than a relaxing hotel.  Parking was shockingly expensive, and increased the cost of our stay by 50%. Only pro:  Good location.;2;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2086;3/17/2012;5puDlZvbRGAiURCgVCPXBQ;TmG8kZmGQevILRxMqrJe-Q;My wife and I made a reservation and because we were meeting a friend in town, called ahead and were assured that they would have a room for us with two queen beds. At checking, we were informed that this was not possible, but that we could have a room with one king bed or a rollaway could be brought to our room. We took the rollaway option so that our friend would not need to sleep on the floor and were told we would need to wait in the room until the rollaway arrived. After 90 minutes of waiting, I called the front desk and was re-routed to an operator who informed me that there would be a $25 charge for the rollaway and that she would need to connect me to the front desk. After five more minutes on hold, I was connected with the front desk. I was assured that they were very busy and the bed would arrive without charge. Pressing them about our dinner reservations that we would soon miss, I was then informed that if we did not place the privacy sign on the room door, the bed could be delivered in our absence. The Hyatt Regency seems unable to keep up with their current level of demand or is extremely poorly managed. We will not stay at one again.;1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

So much walking just to get to your room. Anyways, the check in process was smooth and easy.  Great service.  Valet was expensive but that was expected so no surprise there. The day we left there was protesting done outside the hotel area so we had to go get our car from the valet garage... not really valet service.  On nicer days, it's  a good walk to the shops on Michigan Ave.  In the cold winter days, I would recommend bundling up or getting a taxi.  Overall, good hotel and location.  We always get a deal on priceline!;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

It is quite different at first -took me about a month to get the hang of it!  Since I was on my way to a work related event and we didn't know where else to park, this was our only option.  The attendant reassured me that they have had experience with my kind of car and I left it. When I got back, they had my car back to me within 5 minutes and it was all in one piece. I guess I have Ferris Bueller level paranoia!

The room looks worn and is not up to my standards for almost 200 a night. I ordered room service, and the food was good, but I had an issue with the service. I asked if the guy who brought it up if he had change, he said no. I gave him 40 for a $32.00 meal expecting him to return with my change but he never did.  Needless to say I am not pleased. And I also cannot seem to find any information in this hotel room on the amenities.

They made an error with our reservation and it took them a very long time to resolve it.  They did clear things up.  It also took a very long time to get our car from valet when we checked out.  Amidst all the small problems the Hyatt more than made up for the minor problems that I encountered.;4;2;2;2;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2096;5/20/2006;dcFF9akYubn;6G4Ho6jBuaSmKAOZui8zjg;Location, location, location.  My honey and I went there Mother's Day weekend (for the Beer Fest) ... if we did decide to stay there again, it WOULD NOT be on a popular/holiday weekend or for 39.00 parking charge ~ which you had to do valet (bullpoo!)  Check in is 3:00 and check out it 12:00 and the 39.00 dollar charge is for a 24 hr period, yet you have to have your car out by 12:00 or you pay for an additional day.  I don't get that?!?!  The room was nice and clean but the cleaning people knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning, then at 9:00 a.m. was NOT cool.   But then again, we did have the pleasure of hearing this obnoxious family at all hours.  The only reason that I would recommend the place is for it's location.;3;2;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2097;9/28/2010;luAMUI2SQgdSJoDKEAyYrA;isQxsxlCjj6P8GQ_uuFwew;I so lucked out by getting this place through Priceline for my cousin and I!  It's right on the riverfront and centrally located to so much.  I loved the look and feel of the place as soon as I walked in.  The hotel just seems so open and lighted.  It almost felt like you were outdoors.  The front desk was helpful.  The rooms were decent size and the beds were INCREDIBLY comfy!  I almost thought we weren't going to be able to get up the next morning! :)  They also have this one bar called Big which outlooks on the city.  The only thing that was disappointing was that I didn't have time to check everything out. I would definitely stay here again!;5;1;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2098;9/13/2009;d2bANpxmBi-4wsbQOsRlsA;HaimZBGCu81HtIEEDo-dWw;I can't say any negative about this hotel. See the reasons why:1. Location is great. You are on Wacker Road and a block on Magnificent Mile. 2. There's a Corner Bakery close to the hotel for breakfast (1 block). 3. A minute walk to major bus stops. 4. There's BIG BAR!!! (see my other review). 5. Room deco is minimal - no fancy stuff but it's very clean. 6. Millenium Park (a block), The Loop (about 3 blocks), and shopping area is a block. 7. There's a 24 hour deli which is a plus. Take note:1. At first, I was disappointed because of the location. I wanted it to be noisy, crowded and a touristy area - maybe close to small restaurants etc. (Stay at The Loop Area or Magnificent Mile area if you prefer it that way). But it was a good decision after all. Wacker Road is a major road and it's very convenient when you are a tourist (bus stops). There's a BIG BAR open at night in the hotel and it's always crowded. I mean crowded until 2am everyday even on weekdays! 2. No free breakfast and internet. Complimentary coffee and tea though. 3. Employees are great and helpful. 4. Hotel lobby is not boutique style - it's actually convention/airport like atmosphere. Always crowded and noisy (lobby only) - the way I like. 5. Ok, just one thing... if people are talking on the hallway, it echoes to your room - I think it's an acoustical thing. It happens when we arrived there at about 10am. We usually go out at 10am so no problem at all. At night, nice and quiet. Yes, I recommend this place.;5;1;1;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2100;7/29/2009;rCMTosxTtHxjvEWoQTDK7Q;xWpEpEKAXNhGKafT2Lq_yQ;Eh, I received a great deal for $80 a night so really I can't complain. I don't think I would stay again unless I received the same deal. The rooms seems small and so dark. No pool, which in the summer would have been nice. I did however meet a ton of people in for a Cubs game and Military. It is pretty lively in the morning and night. Easy access to Michigan Avenue and to pretty much every bus route.;3;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2103;7/25/2005;3OtAaeG4D66hHM5g5tA3WA;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;The Hyatt is one of the largest hotels in Chicago, so there are tons of business people sporting badges on their fronts as they shuttle to and from their conventions and seminars. This is a very big and busy place, so one can easily get lost amongst the various public levels, escalators, and meeting rooms. The main lobby is enormous, featuring what was known as the largest bar in the world. The rooms are pleasant enough, but there is no excitement in the overall standard design at all.;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2106;12/6/2010;K7YR3UhhQ5HfswUB64;GBL5e9ZRU0sTT960rsUCvQ;The lobby is decorated a bit tacky, but overall the hotel is nice, and pretty inexpensive considering the location. The concierge was absolutely wonderful, and the guy at the front desk was pretty awesome, too. Rooms are a little small, but the view was nice. There is also a bar around the corner - Houlihan's. The drinks were, (obviously), less expensive than the hotel bar most of the people were locals - you get enough interaction with the tourists in the hotel. Although not 4-star worthy as their website indicates, it was a nice hotel - I have no complaints.;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2108;10/7/2009;-oulhnVEq5hq1h7M6xZTxA;m3T94hCHPmEAredfkunFSw;What more great things can I say about the City of Chicago?  If you are looking for a scenic (right off of the Chicago River/Lake Michigan - - request the West Tower!) hotel with prime customer service, look no further.  From the top to bottom, the staff demonstrates their goal to satisfy.  If you have the means, I highly suggest the executive suites and access to the top floor lounge.  Hyatt Regency is perfect for convention stays, tourist, business trips, or just a weekend get-a-way a half block off of the Magnificent Mile.;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2109;7/26/2010;x8gkUvXMt9ros2G9n72;FjOUBhA2xpVmhg2hECzGLw;I guess it all depends on your expectations from hotels and what tickles you in that category. I'm pretty picky and I like hotels that are new, innovative, stylish and really go out of their way to make you comfortable. So based on my pickiness, adjust the star rating! Parking: This one just flat out pissed me off. I don't mind paying for quality but getting ripped off is a diff story. So they only offer Valet at $50 per day. I should have the choice to park my own car if I want to in a hotel that has two towers on two side of the street and has more than enough parking space to accommodate valet and self park. When you ask the hotel staff for alternate parking info, the response is "we don't know of any other parking available" which is BS. You live and work in Chicago and don't know of other parking lots? Good thing I live in Chicago too and know that the whole area underneath the hotel, the park and some of the surrounding is all multi-level underground parking. Again, being ripped off! So don't get ripped off, if you don't mind a 5-10min walk. Directly next to the hotel's parking on the lower level, you can park for $7 overnight as long as you enter between 3-6pm and leave by 8am. I went in after 6pm so they said it would be $13 as long as I left before 8am. At the end, I decided to just stay in bed so I paid $30 for 24hr period which is still better than $50 in a getting ripped off fashion. In the winter months, that might not be the best choice. Also if you're planning on going in and out, then you might just let them rip you off! Overall: I'd stay here again if I didn't have other choices or if I happen to get it on priceline/hotwire. The lobby is spacious but my favorite feature of the lobby which is the big bar on the front desk floor, is closed during the day!!!!! I'm not a big drinker but I'd much rather sit at that big bar and have lunch! It's amazing how some hotels limit the use of their best feature....maybe they just don't see that as their best feature, who knows. Rooms: I had a junior suite so my room was fairly large with a king bed, desk, very large bathroom, sectional couch and a wet bar. With all that space, I had a tiny tall window which was ceiling to floor but very narrow! The bathroom was large but I just didn't like the quality. It was somewhat older, shower head was one of those "I can do 15 sprays but they all suck" type of shower-heads and amazingly, as large as the bathroom was, most of it was wasted space b/c I didn't even have enough counter space to put my stuff out. Good thing there wasn't a lady with me or I would have had to make her use the wet bar for her space needs lol. Yeah right, I'd probably end up using the closet while she uses the bathroom and the wet bar! Thermostat: I'm not sure what the thermostat in the room did but it definitely didn't control the temp lol I put it on all kinds of numbers and used diff fan speeds but I was either getting frost bites or feeling like I was in a sauna. They also have an A/C vent directly above the bed to blow on you as you sleep so you wake up with frozen sinuses! Smart. Staff: Very friendly, very professional Price: When I look at their regular prices, all I think in my head is "are you kidding me?" I would never pay that kind of money for a hotel like this. If you're not picky about amenities and their quality the way I am, then this hotel might be a good option. It's right in the middle of everything so if you're in town with family but on business, you can take a smelly cab to the loop while your family enjoys MI Ave., Navy Pier, Grant/Millenium Park all within walking distance. You can even skip the smelly cab on the way back and just walk from the your business meeting in the loop back to the hotel.;2;1;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2110;7/21/2009;pqeRXGZJ5wbxBMfmn4hCjA;EYFBZ7bGcfpNT3inokzgPw;If you can get a room here for a deal, make it happen.  Its value is in it's location near the loop and Magnificent Mile. With over 2k rooms there is a large mall or airport feel to the place.  It's convenient and clean.  Especially for business and tourist attractions. I would suggest traveling out of the loop if your looking for a nice evening of Chicago food and bars.  Everything closes early near the hotel and you pay a premium in this business/tourist part of town. There's no free wireless, but they do have neat little computers set up to print your boarding pass before heading out.;4;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2111;3/5/2010;tcAnuZWT9R8DmVWoc6iG8g;R1VYk0HedWDc8J0xfHniuA;Great location. However their staff needs training. I took a red eye from Los Angeles to Chicago and landed at 5:30 am.  I got to the hotel at 6:30 a.m.   When I checked in I was told by the front desk clerk that my room would not be ready until 3 p.m. I showed her my confirmation for a 6:30a.m. Check in. She repeated herself and tolde there was nothing she could do.  I then asked for the General Manager and he told me he could not do anything but would give me the first room that was cleaned. At 9:02 am I was called on my cell phone and given an upgraded room.   The room was great and the service after the first incident was fine.  The good here is just mediocre. OK for a Hyatt but might look to stay somewhere else next time.   DLR;3;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Also, the concierge made a big mistake with one of the services we requested and there was almost always a really, really long line at the concierge desk and it was completely pointless to try to call the concierge from your room, you would just sit on hold for 20+ minutes. (I'm not exaggerating the time spent on hold waiting for the concierge before I finally gave up and this happened on three occasions.) After spending three nights at the Hyatt and three nights at the Palmer House Hotel (which we had to move to because the Hyatt was overbooked), I whole-heartedly recommend the Palmer House and discourage anyone from staying at the dirty Hyatt.;2;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

Given that the main purpose of this impersonal, convention-style hotel is to enable maximum productivity when a person is on the road, one would think that wireless Internet would be a given. As a Chicago native ... well, for a few months, now ... I assumed my time of tangling with the area's lodging spots (refer to my previous Travelodge review) would be distant, repressed memories. I thought wrong, as it turned out my parents were in town in connection with a recent business event that my dad had to attend. Necessarily, I needed to shuttle back and forth between the Hyatt, where they were staying, and my apartment (which, for the record, is lovely and has a fantastic, unlimited access high-speed Internet connection included with my rent). I'll also add that the Starbucks downstairs is a gouging one, that doesn't even have cinnamon or the full array of coffee drinks that I- along with every other traveler/consumer- have come to expect.;2;1;1;1;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

This proved to be a problem in the morning as I apparently entered the breakfast area 'backwards' and was therefore not handed a menu warning me that a cup of coffee, a croissant and a banana would set me back 15 freaking dollars. I asked the man behind the omelet-y bar thing 'which is the free continental breakfast' as was noted on my itinerary from priceline (thank god i didn't pay full price for this place!!!) and he pointed to a middle island. The tub was a little gross and moldy. The toilet didn't flush properly (which I didn't discover until about 9:30 at night (after I spent the day walking throughout the city and was so tired) And....at the risk of sounding impetulant and dumb....the TV they have....how do I say this...sucks. If it's not an NBC Universal company station, Disney or ESPN, they don't have it. Which I found to be ridiculous. It happened to be the night of the season premiere of a show I was looking forward to watching snuggled down in bed and watch...but they didn't have the channel. And it wasn't some arcane channel....it was MTV (yeah, I know....I'm ashamed, but I was on vacation and the Hills is a guilty pleasure, OK?) So...no hills....no hot soak because the tub was so incredibly gross. toilet didn't flush.... Also, with what you pay per night, would free Internet be too much to ask? Or perhaps something less than the 14 or so it was for 24 hours? I can't believe that a huge hotel would consistently nickel and dime you like that. As for the positives: I will say the bed was great- nothing beats a down comforter and the feather pillows were nice. as was the lavender citrus lotion/shampoo. But this hotel..I'm incredulous that someone would pay full price for. No one greets you as you enter....no one asked how my stay was (save for the fellow who hailed me a taxi and was the only person who treated me as a paying customer) I will never come back to this hotel ever. I'm better off paying slightly more for an antiquated 1960's motel.;1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA
2118;3/17/2010;SAoHlsKB2MwKIBLdQFVPrg;QyX-l1rvGlkSL1c6RIHV6Q;This hotel is a complete waste of money - consistent with my experience at most big chains these days.  No personality. Guest are treated like cattle and nickel-and-dimed. Unbelievable. You'd think in this economy they'd actually try to win/keep customers. The Hyatt charges $250+ a night then has the nerve to charge another $15+ for Internet use (PER PERSON in the same room!), and the rooms aren't even that nice - there was actually construction going on in some places. What is shocking is how people put up with this crap  - they must not know better.  When I was unable to find a place to sit down and eat lunch at the main bar/restaurant during lunch (the place was packed for a trade show/conference) I noticed a bunch of tables that were blocked off. I asked if our party could sit at one of these tables. The answer was no, they are not open until later. Are you kidding me? And forget about using your cell phone in the main conference rooms - they won't work. Amazing.  I checked out after one night, went around the block and found a nicer hotel at a third of the price that offered free wireless (even free access to desktop computers in the lobby so you can print your tickets prior to departing), unlimited bottled water and had superior service - like they actually cared about their customers. Well, they won me over and thankfully they have locations in most major cities. Never again Hyatt. Bye.;1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

The club is sectioned off with ropes, so people walking through the lobby can look in at the clubbers. The music at first was mainly techno/house, but later on in the evening the music changed to hiphop. Overall, it was a fun place, but very pricey.

The concierge was unaware of the bike rental facility directly across the street. The room was stylish, but the functionality was terrible. Lighting is poorly designed. Very little storage.

Ascend the glorious staircase to the extravagantly decorated lobby and admire the decor while sipping a cocktail at the turn of the century bar. If you're really feeling opulent, there's high tea on the weekends. The location can't be beat - it's right in the heart of the Loop, close to the historic Marshall Fields building (now sadly a craptastic Macy's). Whether you stay here or just stop in to admire this architectural gem, you'll be transported back in time.

There's no reason for the extra charge if you get the same crappy view, just on a higher floor. 4. Walls are thin, you can definitely hear the hallways and neighbors. Not an entirely horrible stay if you're into interior decor. Otherwise, not much to expect.;2;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2130;7/18/2012;DNXVBpIti-UZGx4LKignPw;oXYuRa_UDJqcfxfjOPRKxA;Currently staying at the Palmer House Hilton during a conference and as old as this building is, I am very pleased with my stay. You can tell that the staff is proud of the hotel because every single staff member, I had the honor of meeting, was very friendly and eager to assist and the hotel is beautifully maintained. The lobby was exquisite...if you appreciated art the way I do, the art on the ceiling will have you walking straight while staring at the ceiling...needless to say, I bumped into a lot of people. Check-in was pretty smooth. Tyler took good care of us allowing us to check-in a few hours early and was happy to answer all of our crazy questions. Our room was on the Executive Floor. Key entry to ride the private elevator to heaven :) The elevator even had a bench for those people who are to lazy to stand lol. We arrive on the 23rd floor and excitement sets in. Let me tell you, Exective level is where its at! Snacks, soda, water available 24/7, Hot hor d'ourves available from 5-7pm, Complimentary contiental breakfast available every morning (not talking bagels and juice...Cold cuts, boiled eggs, plain yogurt, granola, breads, muffins, cereals, juices, coffee, hot oatmeal...sheesh What a spread!!), The room was very clean with a pleasant scent. The bed linens were plush which made it very difficult for me to leave each morning. Only gripe I had was it took me at least 5 minutes to at least turn on the shower each morning....I even had to call the maintence man one morning to demonstrate how to turn it on....he mumbled something about a German design...blah blah. Also, enjoyed a wonderful and filling lunch at Lockwood Restaurant in the lobby.  Try the Ahi Tuna burger and fries.....do yourself the favor, you deserve it! :);4;2;3;2;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2131;8/23/2012;Oa98R6iKSAzb813Q7pRmlw;_K2vd8VyxuktDIfktaq66w;The only reason this hotel is not getting 5 stars from me is the price. Normally my work pays for my trips, and did on this occasion, but I respect the folks out there reading this who may not be flushed with cash. This is a pricey hotel, and is probably a little bit more expensive than it needs to be. The building is old, and thusly, the rooms are not quite as spacious. However, my room did have an attached "living" room with chairs and another flat-screen tv, which helped stretch things out a bit. The lobby truly is spectacular. You come up from ground level by way of escalators and find yourself floored by the cathedral-esque painted ceiling and detailed architecture. Since the room was not ready by the time of check-in, the hotel offered $50 in hotel services for the wait. That $50 was used towards the amazing high tea they offer daily in the grand lobby - best high tea I've EVER had! Lots of food and you could also get a glass of champagne to boot. There was one gentleman with thick-rimmed glasses who would work the desk and he was just so helpful and delightful. He was extremely knowledgeable about the city and could provide both flashy and mega cheap-but-awesome places to go.;4;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The good:  helpful concierge, clean, complimentary drinking water near all entrances, central location right on the El Train line, rooms equipped with mini-fridges, and beautiful lobby, bar, and restaurant. Could be better:  room size, price, and parking cost. Overall, if you are willing to pay around $170 a night minimum, don't need a lot of room, and prefer to be centrally located, this is a decent proposition.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2134;7/25/2012;YWgneSIHJxE5afDCABhlYA;i6w1V5iPWdYKVPnZLOeLkA;This hotel is like the Waldorf Astoria of Chicago.  Its oppulent, its grand, its a Hilton, but its a tad bit musty.  The location is fantastic and the its huge.  The lobby is gorgeous too.  The housekeeping staff is friendly and efficient.  The front desk was hit or miss for me (one agent was less than happy to check me in, the other was incredibly gracious).  The rooms are nice.  The decor is cool and modern, but in line with the existing style of the hotel...sort of Hollywood glam (but in Chicago).  The beds are comfy...but my bathroom was tiny....I mean, extend your arms and you are touching the shower and the door with the sink in front of you and the toilet behind you...TINY.  Elevators can be a bit slow, even though there are like 10 of them...perhaps a few were in repair?   Bottom line:  If you can score a good deal.  Stay here.  I'm not sure I would splurge on this hotel though.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2136;7/16/2012;aUlO2DNV7LQIdF8T7QS4jw;KeuhteHe76DxDlXnkWoDwA;The room I stayed in on the 13th floor was quite comfy. 2 of the 3 nights I passed out in the king size bed with various items (ie room service menu, cell phone, etc) scattered around me. The sheets were clean and cozy, the pillows aplenty & satisfactorily poofy. The room appeared recently redone in an art deco style. I can dig. No peeling wallpaper to complain about whatsoever, not even in the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is compact to the point that closing the door is awkward. Not so great for couples hot hotel seduction, but I was here for a conference. The raised sink as literal wash basin on counter was obnoxious. Also low. I'm tall, quit annoying me with sinks at my knees please. I did not find I was lacking for towel-hangage space, though yes the toilet is like a space rocket. So, too, are people next door if you happen to be so lucky. Very thin walls. Like, hearing people's entire conversations over HBO at midnight thin. All that is redeemed by the Food. The Palmer club is turkey, tomato, Gruyere [chorus of angels], bacon, and a black pepper mayo on multigrain bread. With truffle potato chips. The Sweet corn soup has chorizo, is light, tangy, carries a touch of heat. And, oh, yes, Bertha's brownie. I know not who she is, but I am proud of whoever created this dessert in her name. The brownie, with its fudge syrup and nuts, was good. Maybe not as good as the chocolate ice cream that accompanied it. Definitely not as awesome as the chocolate mousse. Omg. Also, eggs benedict. Not absolutely mind-blowing, but pretty near perfect. Only downside to the room service is that the 'late night kitchen' closes at midnight. At first, I did not realize this when I returned much later from my romp around the city.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2137;6/21/2012;UlxFSqW-iS3N57L5Am4anQ;huHOgjAAeUr6zoV-dcbI9Q;It seemed like a great Priceline deal, nice-sounding hotel in the Loop... until I check in and discover that parking is an astounding $62/night. The desk clerk says "well after all, it IS Chicago." I asked him to have my car stolen:after all, it IS Chicago. The walk to my room was reminiscent of the Big Wheel scene from The Shining.  The room is Grandma-fancy, along with Grandma-pathetic electricals circa 1983. Is that really a double bed? I didn't know hotels had rooms with just one double bed, other than maybe the Y. The room is clean, but tired. Room service shuts down at midnight, again kind of Grandma. I'm sorry - I am a guest here but I have to pay extra to use the fitness room? Barf that. Would I book here on purpose? How many stars am I holding up?;2;2;1;4;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2138;5/28/2012;CE208CSDi0ibe-hOQFTRLg;edMTkM8eoD3FLcpO_OxnqQ;I'm feeling slightly charitable by rounding up to 4 stars for our Memorial Weekend trip. I'll break it down. Where I always start... Bathrooms: This one was fairly clean - a solid 8/10 but it loses major points for being the size of a brook closet. It was difficult to get in and out of to close the door, and there was no good place to put wet towels after our showers. I'm smaller than an average size woman, and I had some trouble maneuvering. The updates that were done to the bathroom did give it nice modern appeal. Toilets and shower were extremely noisy. The middle of the night bathroom trip could have woken the dead from their slumber! Room: Decent size room for the price. We were told we had a queen bed, but ti felt a little snug for a queen. The bed sunk in the middle a little bit (I would assume with a bed that size that typically only one person would sleep in it at a time). Linens were comfortable and enough pillows. Decor was nice and looked as if it had been recently updated. I liked the modern color scheme. The wallpaper on the walls was peeling in multiple places. Seems like such an easy fix that just wasn't done. Location: Just a few blocks away from Millennium Park and Grand Park, steps away from all color el stations and a block away from State Street shopping. I have no complaints with it! We actually walked almost everywhere the whole weekend because of the nice weather. Overall, the hotel itself was beautiful. I wished they would have cranked up the AC a little bit more in their common areas with the highs in the mid to upper 90s in Chicago. And their lobby is on the second floor which I found to be strange and somewhat frustrating as the signage wasn't terrific when we were checking after walking with bags on a warm day. Plenty of elevators (they are split in sections of rooms which was nice for a building that size - never waited more than 60 seconds). All common areas were neat and clean, the staff we did encounter was quite pleasant. Worth the money we spent on a hotwire deal, but I'd never pay full price for this place!;4;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2139;5/20/2012;KezkZiWxetiA5Kvc9YaCsA;GAdSK30_nawAsNoqbB244w;I stayed here for 5 weeks on a business trip. Had a total blast! The rooms were outstanding and it's in a great location for people who are working with businesses in the loop. Spent way too much at the Starbucks in the lower level, as well as the bar in the lobby. The architecture here was unparalleled. Internet not included in rooms and neither is the fitness center, which are both pretty big cons. I would definitely stay here again! Even if I had to pay for it myself.;5;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2140;7/26/2012;IRBwIERKYyCbd63JFXVo3g;KZPCvP0nWRS9OctYf4bubw;The Palmer house is the epitome of  posh and outrageous glamour.  The 60-foot ceiling lobby is dripping with ornate baroque decor: golden winged angels hoisting chandeliers, lavish elaborate carpets, marble archways, and full-circle velvet sofas at the hub of a bank of golden-doored elevators. The hallways of the rooms promintently display black-and-white photos of the stars of the "golden age" - singers, musicians, actors of all kinds grace the silent hallways. There appears to have been some renovation based on other reviews and the curtains of other rooms I noticed from my window.  My room on the 17th floor was quite lovely - art deco furniture, lovely colors, "Hollywood-style" decorative bathroom and closet door handles were a reminder of a past golden age. A few minor annoyances - no coffee maker in my room (big, huge boo for a business traveler.)  The buttons on the phone didn't connect to... well, anywhere (wake up calls, etc.) No free internet except in the lobby (which seems to be pretty typical these days.)  The instructions for the check out process are incorrect and you can't set a time for checkout.  So, I accidentally checked out when I wasn't ready to leave for a few hours (in conference meetings all morning.)  The phone operator didn't understand this predicament and kept forwarding me to non-answering numbers. Besides that, the desk staff and concierges were all very nice and professional. I really didn't have a problem with the hotel being on the second floor.  With a Starbucks on the 1st and easy access to 3 main streets, I was pretty happy. Having a martini in the hushed, lavish lobby was dreamy... We'll be back!;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The building is beautiful, with ceilings covered in paintings, reminding you of the glory days, where people dressed up to go out, and lavish lifestyles prevailed.   The lobby bar is a great place to hang out for drinks and watch hundreds of guests and even locals come to quench their thirst.  Their is a high end restaurant in the lobby as well, but I never did make it inside - it looked good. My morning Starbucks run was simplified, since there is a Starbucks on the first floor.  No, it wasn't one of those fake Starbucks that just serves some, it was a full fledged store.   If you are looking for a very reasonable hotel, located in a great location, you have to try the Palmer House Hilton.;4;19;20;10;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2142;5/2/2012;pQxlWHh;Myy-tV1aKksxkQ2R7QUkAQ;The Palmer House is one of the most famous grand hotels in Chicago. The lobby on the second floor is gorgeous:there's lavish furnishings, majestic ceiling, and of course, impeccable service by their well trained staff. As far as location is concern, it can't be any better. It's in the historic Chicago loop, close to corporate office buildings, Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, theatre at Randolph Street and State Street shopping. But come evening, this area can be a little quiet but walking north from the hotel will get you to Grand/Chicago Ave where restaurants and clubs are. The executive rooms have wonderful perks such as private elevators to the rooms and all day snack bar offered to executive guests only. However, the rooms are a bit on the small side though. The room that I was in, had two bathrooms but the bed took up most of the bedroom space. Despite that, Palmer House should be on your places to check out in Chicago, especially if you like grand old hotels. Be careful not to walk past the hotel though because I find it hard to recognize it from the street level since loop buildings are so close one another.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The lobby is beautiful and retains a certain grandness that can't be replicated. Check in was smooth and the rooms and bathrooms were very clean. Housekeeping was quick and efficient...and Holy Margin Erosion Batman, FREE wifi. I would give this hotel four stars even if I had paid double of what I did. Looks like this hotel has deals going quite a bit through various travel sites. I found that booking directly with the hotel got me the discounted rate without prepaying the entire amount.

This was m first time staying in the loop and the next time I'm in Chicago, I will stay here again. In defense of the nay-sayers: -Parking is expensive but it is the loop in Chicago, so no matter where you are staying you will have to pay an arm and a leg. If you don't use the valet, your car is parked across an empty street in a secured building and it is a one minute walk. -The rooms are on the smaller side, but  for a weekend in Chicago, who really spends too much time in their hotel room? You still get a bed, a desk, a closet, and an extra chair. -The entire weekend I was able to connect to the wifi from the Starbucks around the corner and I was on the 15th floor.;4;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I paid a pre-negotiated rate for $85 and never was I treated like someone who paid a negotiated rate. I took advantage of an upgrade to a double room in the executive suite on floor 23 for an additional $55. The room was wonderful. I am a HUGE fan of two beds/two baths. The room had two closets, safe, bathrobes, a flat screen and IPOD clock. Amazing showers and pressures. The beds were very comfortable. The only thing that could have made the room better was free wifi.... HOWEVER on the exec floor there were computers available. Also on the exec floor was a bartender, free non alcoholic beverages, snacks, appetizers, and breakfast. The parking is ridiculous but we paid overnight parking up the street for $12. The hotel is next door to Miller Pub which had great food for the value and a wider variety than I thought for pub food. Location.....wonderful for sites and shopping.

2152;1/6/2012;Z5TMUHIT3-WZqCR-xAIEDA;EjRUFL0aoORBMfsmmkF3Qw;Giving this hotel only two stars breaks my heart. I have a big old soft spot for the Palmer House, as it was the hotel I stayed in on my first trip to Chicago nearly 20 years ago. Back then I thought it was the most luxurious hotel in the world and will always remember that trip fondly. So I was excited to go back, and there were elements of my stay that lived up to my great memories. Fabulous location. Gorgeous lobby and common areas. Unfailingly polite and cheerful service from check-in to room service to housekeeping. Good-sized, relatively quiet room on a high floor. Nice lounge with tasty drink selections. Three big disappointments, though: 1. My room, albeit spacious, was tired and dated. I was surprised at how annoying it was to have an old tube TV stashed away in an inconvenient armoire instead of a flat screen on a more accessible bureau-top. 2. Hotel wireless was expensive and slow. I don't mind paying extra for premium wireless service, provided I actually GET premium wireless service. But I didn't see any real difference in what I got for my $19.99 at the Palmer House than I would for free at any Courtyard by Marriott. 3. But the real reason for the two-star review: My bathtub was a deathtrap. I am not kidding. The liner had separated from the tub frame and was all warped and spongy, so every morning it felt like I was taking a shower on a trampoline. It kept me so off balance I had to shampoo with one hand while clinging to the soap dish with the other. I could not imagine being an elderly person trying to navigate that dangerous enclosure. It's a wonder someone has not fallen, broken a hip, and sued them. My colleague, who has more Hilton points than I, stayed on one of the renovated floors and told me his room was really nice. He also snuck me into the concierge lounge, which was very comfortable and served up great wines and tasty hot and cold appetizers. So maybe the moral of the story is...stay at the Palmer House but on a concierge floor. That's a solution I could live with.;2;1;2;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The service, from the check-in staff, to the bartenders in both the outer lounge bar (which I loved), to the bar just down the hall inside the hotel is super friendly. The open sitting area near the bar is comfortable and welcoming. There are bar tables off to one side with iPad's in upright holders, for anyone's entertainment. Bonus...they lowered their valet prices, which is nice, since the hotel rooms are quite pricey. At least you don't have to take it up the yin yang from all directions. I can't forget to mention that there is a Starbucks in the building as well...this is a definite plus for coffee drinkers like myself. The rooms are a nice size, but most importantly...clean!

2154;2/8/2012;7K-cXl83zddzFQopmHVkog;mZU5pL2eMh20227O28DjSA;I was able to negotiate my way to a decent deal for a three night stay in Chicago at the Palmer House Hilton. It was my first time negotiating on Priceline, and I believed it to be a great deal on a long Summer weekend that would get me out of Cedar Rapids.  The Palmer House proved to be a great experience, and not just because its a Hilton either. After doing some research I found there was certainly some history to the location, and I have to mention that they have done a decent job at preserving it. I was given a room clearly meant for one person, partly because I told them it was just me and also because I didn't mind not getting extra space. My first thought after entering the room was more a long the lines of "This is the most perfect 1 bedroom you could find"! One could argue that another perspective would be- "This is an extra store room"! Don't get me wrong, it was a small room that I greatly admired...clearly for one person. Other than that, the amenities and everything else was pretty good. You do notice the age of the property at times, but it does sell itself as a historic venue in Chicago. The lobby itself is quite a beautiful! The ceiling tapestry, the swanky bars, and the excellent decor makes it a place to be on any given night! Definitely a great place for a few drinks with friends to start off the evening. The service was very good and attentive, although I hardly needed anything after my initial check in. And you cannot beat the location that the hotel is in! Fairly close to the CTA lines, and being right in the Loop is a big plus!;4;0;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2159;6/19/2012;u3KsuxmEq0-uKGfokMsMxA;kLvaHkfKWrVXlWxpZ-ZWFg;The Palmer House is very beautiful and has an impressive lobby- so 1st impressions were great!  The restaurant and bar in the lobby looked great, although we never ended up dining there.  Location was fantastic, we walked everywhere and found great sites and restaurants.  $250 a night was about right for the cost per night, much higher and it wouldn't be worth it. Our check in was great, the staff person was fantastic, offering us great food recommendations and was very friendly.   He offered us the option to upgrade to the executive tower/room.  It was $45 more per night, it included a bigger room, that didn't look straight at another building, a DVD player, WiFi, and the executive lounge that offered free continental breakfast each day, non alcoholic beverages throughout the day and happy hour appetizers and snacks each night.  We went for it and I think it was worth it.  The room was comfortable, the lounge was great to pop into to grab a drink or snack.  It would have been better if a drink or two was also included, but the bar was open from 3-11 each night, so it was nice to have access to that.   The executive floors have their own "express" elevators, a business center and some cozy couches/chairs with TV's. The only downside that I can mention is that they "concierge" was non responsive and even when we left a message on their line, we were NEVER called back.  Really?  That seemed strange.  But we let it go.  Also, the maids were not the greatest.  They made the bed but failed to take our breakfast dishes (they just left them all on the tray), and they didn't change out our towels, instead, just folded them back up and replaced them (we could tell, because one of them had corn flakes on it from a spill we had earlier).;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2160;2/15/2012;bPHrLkuNwwmi9PBROnXZBw;6Jopvq1K9PtrqBaXt2ZdaQ;Over all it was a nice hotel, but nothing special in my opinion. The hotel appears to be fairly classy with a swanky lobby. The hotel floors are reminiscent of a maze, having to pay close attention to signage in order to get to and fro. The rooms are nothing to write home about, at least the standard room. 2 beds, dresser, closet, tv, etc. The bathroom was exceptionally small, but it is an old building, so I'll over look it. During my stay I didn't try the either the bar or restaurant, but it is close to plenty of other options one can choose to eat and drink at.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2161;6/11/2012;7RpOLkiz83Ranfxctj9;NPRyDEG1D2taLdbdXhrNlA;Two weeks ago I celebrated my birthday in Chicago and had the great fortune of staying at the Palmer House Hilton for five days. There are many adjectives that I could use to describe the Palmer House but the words elegant and character are at the top of my list. This is an absolutely terrific hotel and if you have never stayed there, at least do yourself the favor of dropping by for a drink or lunch. This hotel has it all and the overall rating of three and a half stars on Yelp is ridiculous. I have travelled the world and if this is not at least a four star hotel then I do not know what is. From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me? This is what one would consider to be a "grand" hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say "Wow" out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable. My room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. The service was amazing. A very classy lady named Tatyana from Bulgaria checked me in. I told her I was excited to be there for my birthday and after a brief chat she upgraded my room. Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection. Efficiency accompanied by courtesy is a rare combination in today's world. The courtesy extended by Tatyana was impressive because of its rarity and its genuineness. The hotel is centrally located near the blue and red subway lines obviating the need for you to take a cab from Chicago's O'Hare airport. You can walk to Millennium Park, the Navy Pier, The Chicago Art Institute and there are good restaurants nearby like "The Gage," the upscale "Russian Tea Time" or casual Bennigans. For your morning coffee go around the corner and have Dunkin Doughnuts! This is a fantastic hotel and I look forward to spending my next birthday there!;5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2162;3/18/2012;RMVFAm65njkSHar95Sf4uA;lFc_RXY4lLpghA_ScbbAzA;I will never ever ever again set foot in this hotel ever again.   I don't even know where to begin. I came here in hopes for a relaxing spa day with my girls.  I know parking is crazy expensive in the loop, but they have 24 hour valet which is much cheaper so its fine right? No.  I get to the front and the bell man says no valet.... I point the sign that says 24 hour valet in confusion.... man says no... and i think to myself- WTF? ??  so... I end up having to park in some garage across the street and the bell man assured me I could get my parking validated. So fine.   The elevators are SO small.. and old... and seriously I thought I was gonna get stuck in one.  But that is not why I am giving this hotel 1 star.  I am giving this hotel 1 star because I have never experienced such nasty service at any other hotel before. I had to get my parking validated after our time at the spa.  The spa sent me downstairs.  First I got to the concierge.  They can't validate it.  So then I am sent to the front desk... There's a crazy line of people checking in so I thought - well- validation takes 30 seconds so let me just ask someone to validate it.  I go up to someone real quick and ask politely... he responds with a sarcastic rude tone- "you want validation??? stand in line and you'll get it"   Are you kidding me? I did not respond because I just didn't know what the beep to say to his rude a$$.  How do you seriously talk to a customer like that???  I'm still in disbelief.  Then I stand in line.  After 15 minutes, I finally get to someone and ask him to validate it.  He informs me that since I was not a guest at the hotel, I cannot be validated.  I told him about their valet service not working and he said that its not working today bc the president was at their hotel the day before- what does that have to do with anything?!?! I told them the bell man dude in the front of the hotel said I could be validated, but again I got attitude from this front desk guy.  Then I told them that the spa said the front desk could validate me-- he said go back up to the spa so they can validate me-- but hello they are the ones that sent me downstairs!?  He said he needs proof from the spa... I offered to show him my receipt from the spa but he wasn't having it.  I mean, did I look like a young illiterate teenage punk to these people or something? I'm a freakin 30 yr old physician. WTF. I have NEVER experienced this type of stupidity and crappy service and disrespect of customers from any hotel in chicago before-- not the elysian, not the intercontinental, not affinia, not sofitel, not the W, not the Wit, not the Dana, not the Amalfi, not the Trump, not even the freakin comfort suites!  And also, I kind of was a guest at the hotel--- how bout the fact that I was a guest at the hotel's sorry excuse of a spa and each of my friends got 2 services done and we spent half a freakin day at this crap hotel.  I was fuming but left.  Got to the parking garage and saw that I had to pay 30 some bucks for parking, which would have been around $14 or less if they had their "24 hour valet service" working, OR would have been zero dollars if validated.  That's just not the point tho, I have money to spend, but after the responses and attitude I got from these highly untrained workers, it was just really disappointing.   There is SOOOO much more to this story but I have lost the energy to tell any more of it.  All I know is that for a hotel to make themselves out to be so prestigious, they sure do treat their guests like dirt.  I will NEVER be back here.  I would never recommend this backward hotel to anyone ever. OH- and their SPA SUCKS btw.  NEVER AGAIN... stick to the Elysian (Waldorf Astoria) people.;1;6;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2163;9/18/2011;zmNFF630GeXfHbLYgn5Y6g;sP9W9AwHWPDVA1W11dcW_A;I have been to motels in small towns in India that offer more emenities. Seriously. This hotel was one of the worst I have stayed at in terms of convenience. Big giant old tv in the room. NO fridge. Tiny room for over $200/night. I was here for a corporate event, and even the customers who came to visit during the day were complaining about the confusing layout of the hotel. Its ornate and beautiful, but that's about it. There are two places to eat at the hotel, that's it. One is closed during the day. So, one place to eat. "Good luck getting breakfast" the lady at the front counter joked no too long ago. She was actually very nice, and it was kind of funny, but... I was hungry and it's raining outside :P So now I'm at the corner street bakery. Kind of a shame, because there is so much history behind the hotel. Made as a gift for Palmer's wife in September 1871 it burnt down 13 days later in the great Chicago fire. Only to be rebuilt in plush opulent style and setting by 1873. It was the world's first fireproof hotel. It also boatsted telephone and electricity in every room, and something called an 'elevator'. They promoted it by saying it's a train between floors connected by pulley & rope. Palmer took out a $1.7 M loan, at the time to rebuild it, the largest loan for somethig like this. (I think that number is correct). In 1925 it was rebuilt again, this time going from 7 stories to 25 stories. At the time, the largest hotel in the world. In 1943 Conrad Hilton bought it for $20 million. And so, began it slow descent to wired wifi and big booty television sets. The Internet- you have to be plugged in to your room for the wifi to work!!! THAT'S NOT WIFI!!!! Or, you can get "wifi" in the hotel lobby, for $8/Hr. $20/night to be plugged in. And the cable is so short you kind of have to sit at the uncomfy desk, no laying in bed surfing the web action. I asked if I can check out an hour later. There is no one after me staying in the room, but, apparently it is hotel policy to Charge $50 if you check out at 1pm. This place is a joke. DO NOT STAY HERE. Instead, check out an air bnb, that's what I'm doing for the rest of my trip here :) Oh, also... This place is haunted... Heard multiple people say they heard whispers :) PS: Paris Hilton sucks too. There.;1;1;1;10;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

We demanded they move us to a different room on a different floor and wash/dry clean all our stuff, which they did. But they didn't even offer a discount on the room! Besides the bedbugs, the room generally was run down and didn't feel clean. Would never stay here again.;1;2;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2166;8/6/2011;8UfXxPWkqJiQaL1Z3Q7OQg;9bLLhB3Ji4miHY6I4jxgvA;In general I dislike Hiltons.  You always pay to much for what you end up getting when you stay there.   This Hilton you could buy wifi for $7 an hour in their Starbucks. And the elevators were SO FREAKING SLOW.  HORRID. Staff were not friendly - even the peeps behind the desk at the Hilton Rewards check in line were very put out by all the distasteful guests that were showing up and wanting to check in.  The nerve of us. Never again.  Not ever.  And seriously, Hilton, I am doing what I can to stay away from you in general if I can from now on.  You just are not worth the money. Its not me, its you.;1;3;0;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2167;8/5/2011;lSgfJWCQYhAGy0uVOqi0TA;8NB_8ts5tdrPl3SRUNOhng;Three dollar signs is right! Historic building right smack in downtown Chicago? Yup, you get what you pay for. Swaaaaaaaan-ky! Luckily the university program I was with helped with costs, and even then, G-W-0-W! But all that aside, if you decide to treat yourself, definitely do Palmer House. Millenium Park, Chicago Institue of Art, Michigan Avenue, metro stops, & yummy eateries are ALL within walking distance. The hotel rooms are nice and cozy, the light up mirror in the bathroom help you see every pore on your face --perfect for tweezing eyebrows & perfecting your make-up, the bath towels are super soft, the hallways are covered with old photographs, the lobby is beautifully & elegantly decorated and the staff are super helpful.;5;2;2;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2168;8/15/2011;FMpu;KAcSvtZwFFnKwQ3L1D6FVw;Now, I was prepared not to write a negative review despite the fact that this hotel charges an additional $20/day for internet (there is no wireless - you have to plug your computer in like in the Middle Ages). I was prepared to ignore the fact that the gym costs extra. I usually love any hotel, so for me to take the time to write such a negative review means something is wrong. After I got home on Monday, I realized I had left a dress hanging in the closet in our room. I called right away, and they directed me to the Security/Lost and Found department. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally spoke with a woman there. I explained what had happened, gave my room number, described the dress, and provided my contact information. The woman told me that she would have someone check the room right away and call me back later in the day. She never called me back. I called again in the evening, and got a man on the phone. He told me that a couple had checked into the room and that they could not find out if the dress was in there until the next day. I called back on Tuesday, and they told me that the couple had checked out, and they would send someone to look for the dress, and then call me back. No call. Then I called a couple hundred more times, to no avail. On Wednesday, I had to leave the country for a week, so I made a last call from the airport, and was told they would check and call me back. Nothing. My girlfriend then called them for me on Friday and Saturday, without success, because another couple had checked in by that time, and apparently it was impossible to find out whether a dress was hanging in the closet before they arrived. Finally, a full week later, I called and got a man named Michael in the Security Department. He got someone to go to the room and look for my dress, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by that point. Michael apologized and told me that his supervisor was out of the office. I then asked to speak to a Customer Service representative. The hotel operator transferred me to a voicemail. When I called back, she transferred me to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman who informed me that the hotel "doesn't have a Customer Service department" and hung up on me. I called back one more time, was again transferred to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman named Nikita who told me that the front desk "handles customer service." She then transferred me to her supervisor's voicemail (Ms. Cruz), which stated, "I am in the office all day but unable to take your call." Is that even a thing? Every single time I called, I was on hold for 10-20 minutes at least. The total disregard for customer service was both ridiculous and time-consuming. I would encourage anyone who wants a smooth experience to avoid this hotel.;1;3;0;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2169;9/21/2011;F5gH3nB759ByULLjgdHEtA;7dwh3pL2tbSeSvL0qLzUrw;The architecture in this place is amazing. I've stayed here a handful of times in the past few years (as a getaway). My most recent visit brought a few good surprises. 1. The valet/parking people have really upped their game. I have no desire to deal with parking when I'm in the loop and they just dropped their prices by more than $10 (I know right, in this economy?). 2. The food is phenomenal. 3. The staff inside the hotel are friendly Downsides: 1. Don't get a room too low to the ground, the view sucks 2. The front desk is more like a zoo than a service station. Although they do "care" they are very busy and unless you are Ghandi your personalized service is not going to be very personalized. 3. State street is home to some of Chicago's finest homeless community. If you venture more than a couple blocks south after dark you might get shanked.;5;1;2;3;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2170;11/19/2011;BgmVo1nhayOUxRlHMAkqHQ;qOODN0RsLbNQaLPN3srixQ;Went here for Afternoon Tea yesterday and had a very nice time.  I loved sitting in the lobby, as the ceiling and surroundings are so beautiful.  The jasmine pearl tea was delicious, as were the scones.  These scones were delightful and the best of the foods presented.  The sandwiches and desserts were fine but nothing I would readily seek out again. I may come back, as this was  a fun and relaxing experience.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The rooms just seem extremely antiquated and dated, and they are not as comfortable or visually pleasing as one would hope. It's probably just a matter of personal taste, though! The lobby area is one of the most grand and gorgeous in all of Chicago, and I recommend it without reservation for drinks/coffee/food/etc.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I had to close the bathroom door to get to the mirror. The location is great for access to State St. and nearby restaurants and shopping. I was not overly impressed with the hotel food service, but the hotel staff was very friendly. The cleaning lady for my floor asked my how my day was going and if i needed anything.

It was remodeled but the sink was so small that I could hardly find room for my razor and toothbrush.  Also, the view from my room was non-existent. A wall.  That said, the bed was comfortable and the normal Hilton Honors perks were provided.  It just doesn't excel in any category.;3;2;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2175;6/6/2011;FliRxj4NrYVR;bXmJD9Xcr8H1wgIkjC1Blw;If you are offered an upgrade to the executive floor for $19, take it.   The regular rooms are TINY.  The rooms are ok as far as style goes, just a little outdated.  Old, CRT TV's, no wifi in the rooms, and the bathrooms need major overhauls.  The showerheads are out of a dollar store with lousy pressure and the sealant around the tub and toilet was peeling up or missing. The staff was great, 'nuff about that. Wifi is sold by the hour in the lobby, $7.  Wired internet is available in the rooms for $15-20 a day. The hotel overall is very nice, there is a CVS and parking across the street.  We may come back, but not to the regular rooms.;3;2;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2176;4/25/2011;EC;ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q;I love old. The history, the people who have gone there before me, the beauty and grandeur of a time gone by, these are all things that draw me to historic places and hotels. The Palmer House Hilton is no exception. Its perfect location close to Millennium Park, nearby shopping, theaters and all that Chicago has to offer makes it a perfect choice when in Chicago. Built in 1871, the Palmer House still exudes the charm and grace of an era gone by. The lobby is breathtaking with it's soaring ceiling painted in 1900 (one of the most photographed ceilings in the world) and the gilded figurines done by Tiffany oh so many years ago. It's quite splendid. As for the rooms, they are okay. They have been upgraded over the years but know given the size of this hotel (over 1600 rooms) that this place gets alot of use so some areas feel a little worn out. On this visit- my room with the soaring ceilings had a large king bed (with some comfy linens) and the bathroom was recently redone. On the down side- there is no coffee maker in the room (it's a Hilton- what Hilton doesn't have free coffee?) they charge a daily fee for Internet use, the TV is bulky and old, there is no mini bar, and because it is an old building, the rooms can greatly vary in size. But here's a trick. If you want those big fluffy towels that I've come to expect from the nicer hotels, tip your housekeeper. The first day I was here- the towels and toiletries were functional but not fancy. Day 2, after I tipped the housekeeper? Sumptuous thick towels and upgraded toiletries. Coincidence? I think not! If you want a drink- try Potter's Bar. And for breakfast, lunch and dinner- Lockwood Restaurant located in the beautiful lobby is open. While there may be a line for weekend breakfast- tell the hostess that you are fine with the communal high top table and you will be seated immediately! Room rates vary so do a bit of negotiating and you should be able to get a competitive rate to other places in the city. And leave the car at home. Valet runs $61 a day (with in and out privileges) or you can park it yourself for about $15 less at one of the nearby parking garages (my favorite is one block south on Adams) It's a piece of Chicago history- still vibrant today. I love the photos of all the famous people who once played in the Empire Room that line the halls of this hotel. I love the opulence and grandeur that are the public spaces. I love afternoon tea in the beautiful lobby. And if I close my eyes, I love that I can almost see the generations that have gone here before me.;4;5;3;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2177;5/23/2011;uz4iW17Louqcc-kZ;vKUlUXLVylwdttu7h1_Y5Q;Ok, so I'm admittedly an architecture and history freak.  This place had me sensory functions hitting all cylinders!  The lobby has an incredible ceilings that words really can't describe.  Every nook and cranny of this place had such great architectural detail it was just overload for me.  Freaking OVERLOAD!  It wasn't just old school stuff either, there was a mix of touchscreen monitors for flight schedules (how cool is that?) and updated elevators so they weren't slow as molasses.  Nothing worse than a slow elevator in an old building.   The Lockwood Restaurant provides a nice bar on the main lobby area and you can catch a great cup of coffee at Starbucks downstairs at the street level. The most amazing thing was every time I would ride the elevator and people would get off on their floor I would notice that every elevator lobby on each level was different and had it's own design.  Whether it was a piano as the main piece or a circular couch, each lobby had a unique flair. On top of all this, this hotel has been privileged enough to have guests such as Mark Twain and many great presidents and one stay and you will realize why.  Simply amazing!;5;2;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2178;6/28/2011;ZPwC088xWS1TZ5jnd5E0dg;5MZGcmlojIXaPIZwT5pWnQ;If you don't stay here, do walk in and see the lobby. Stay for lunch or just a glass of wine. It is one of those amazing grand old hotel lobbies. Plus the food is good and the service great. Second, if you want a hotel with a great gym, this place gets $10 more from you but it is a great big gym with tons of stuff. Plus the space is cool- they covered a section of roof amongst the towers, so it has a dramatic feel. And great gear and a lot of it, In addition to hitting you up for the gym, they also get $9.95/day for the Internet- and it is a wire. I had to work so plugged in laptop and played Netflix on the iPad at my desk, versus the usual sprawl on the bed in front of tv (and their tv's are old). Room-service service good, food OK. Comfy bed. Pretty deep tub that is bath worthy if you have such an inclination. Quiet.   The rooms aren't luxe but are nice. It is a great location.

I don't know how she did it, but one of my fellow bridesmaids got us a room for $95 a night.  Holy bajeezus, man.  Nothing skews your sense of power more than a high class hotel room for that little money.  I wanted to freak out and just start breaking things, rock star style. ANYWAY.  My only gripe with the room is that there's no mini fridge.  Wtf?  How's a girl supposed to keep her liquor chilled?  We made do with a bathtub full of ice.  Incidentally, we also couldn't get the drain to stay plugged, so I guess fun sexy bath time is a no-no.  On the plus side, the closet is huge.  So big, in fact, that we made our guy friend sleep in there.  He loved it, haha.;4;4;1;5;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I have a deep appreciation for the Palmer House for its historical significance, but not for the insignificance of the size of the rooms. The interior of this hotel is something to truly marvel at. The rooms are small, so get ready to get packed in if you are staying here or plan on spending your time outside of your room. The hotel is in close proximity to most everything downtown, so you will not have trouble getting around. I'd suggest stopping for a drink at Potter's or dinner at Lockwood restaurant, but not actually staying at the hotel.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2182;4/9/2012;frCJmvrgtX3K2vUc0CGOXw;SFvPwc2qnmLIZohcW3ZVEA;Beautiful hotel. Perfectly located. The rooms although stunningly decorated are a bit small. This is a hotel to visit if you want the extravagant atmosphere. It is very large and although there are many entrances and exits (it covers an entire block) it is a bit like being a hotel hostage. There is a starbucks and many other shops to enjoy which is nice.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2183;3/10/2011;ujZKP6dJ44YTsKy;JY6IepgSDkESrtMl1GCD_Q;Considering this place is a 4 star hotel, I was slightly disappointed with the room decor. The hotel lobby area was so grand and beautiful. I was sure the rooms would be just as nice. Unfortunately, I was slightly let down once I walked into my room. The lighting could've been a lot better, the bathroom door didn't close correctly, and the TV they had was probably the oldest TV I've seen in a hotel room in a while (it wasn't even a flat screen...WTF?). I don't like how these ritzy type hotels charge for internet. I mean, if you're going to charge us that much for a room, at least provide us with some internet so we can get work done, check our emails, Yelp...you know? But other than that, I was comfy in my room. Location was great, next to Millennium Park, short walk from the Cultural Center and Art Institute, and a bunch of restaurants nearby. There was also an entrance to the subway line right in front of one of the hotel entrances. I'm not quite sure if I'd stay here again. Depends on the neighborhood and prices and everything. I wouldn't say that I would never consider this place again, but maybe I'll check out something new if I were given the opportunity.;3;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Most of the rooms have been updated, which is also nice. It's about a mile from the more popular stores on the strip, so if you're a walker you'll like that, if you're not that won't be so fun. It's a nice stay, nice staff and a Starbucks on the street level. I'll stay again.;4;0;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Close to a bunch of subway stops. In the Theatre District, you will be able to soak up a lot of history just walking around the hotel itself. The hallways are filled with pictures of performers from days gone by. The furniture is all really nice and fits the decor of the hotel. There's a couple restaurants that we did not get to try, but I'm sure they're pretty good. I'm sure they're probably pretty expensive as well. All the staff was really nice and would not hesitate to stay here again.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2186;9/2/2011;wezMM1l7;3Rh4z7OoZQoH6LXgh783YA;This place was disappointment to say the very least. At first glance it looks grand and ornate, but don't look too closely or you will be sorely disappointed. Front desk check/reception was rude, arrogant and reluctant to be helpful. Did I mention RUDE? On a positive note, the housekeeping staff was first class, professional and very helpful. In my humble opinion, the housekeeping staff should switch positions with the front desk employees and this place would be, without a doubt, five stars. I will avoid Hilton's whenever possible. Based on rudeness and arrogant front desk , I would have given a minus star if I knew how.;1;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2189;1/4/2010;LCq8Yn9mIpXsMFtmDqROHw;jO44Apni7iJZVVK4HQ60tA;This gets 4 stars instead of 3 because I am in absolute, mad, historically infused love with the lobby and the building.  This is a grand dame.  The lobby and ballrooms are the stuff of guilded age fantasy-- Tiffany doors, lots of gilding.  I just finished reading "Devil in the White City" so I enjoyed the continuing history lesson.   Although I did not partake of the restaurants, the high tea looked adorable and the bars looked elegant and pleasant.  They have a Starbucks downstairs!! The staff was increadably nice and helpful. The beds were very comfortable, piled with high quality pillows and down comforters and laid out with soft, high thread count sheets.  They were wonderful and relaxing.  The room was large, pretty and clean.   The price was not bad-- $118 for a king sized room on New Year's Eve weekend, using our AAA discount. Problems: the noise and the bathrooms.  Our room was near the El, so we enjoyed a muted whoosh every 15 minutes or so.  The windows were double paned, so it sounded like a very heavy gust of wind, rather than a Blues Brothers tenament teeth rattling.  The walls were not soundproof, so I know when our neighbors used the loo or when the maid pulled the cart down the hall.  Also the bathrooms were very small.  Very, very small.  And spartan.  Certainly not fitting with the rest of the place. Also, bring change.  There are no coffee makers, and the $2.50 soda machines don't like dollars.;4;6;5;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2190;11/16/2009;ZAzL4jY43JDp0LhreidTrw;rV6r9Fd6eneEanxuComVCA;Hotwire landed me here for $75/night.  Since I wanted a Loop hotel that wasn't a hooker hotel but still within my "work is NOT paying for this" budget.  So I was not unpleased that I'd be staying here.  My grandparents' best friends had honeymooned here, so it had some third-hand nostalgia going for it.  Throw in a fab location, and I was thrilled when I walked in. If the hotel were a person, it'd be old-money.  (Like the cranky great-aunt you hope to inherit from.)  But like old-money, there's some rust around the edges.  The lobby is amazingly gorgeous.  No hands down.  The guest rooms... kinda small and shabby, for a Hilton.  The closet and bathroom were tiny.  There was only about a foot of clearance betwixt door and dunny in the loo, and that doesn't really work.  There was only about 6" of vanity space on either side of the sink.  I'm sure this was standard when the place was built, and it's modern standards that have changed.  But still.  It's a bit cramped, and it was just me in the room. Realistically, it's an older building, and a skyscraper at that, which is going to entail lots of structural support to work around.  Revamping the guest rooms would probably entail knocking down walls and re-doing entire floors, which would be disruptive to other guests, a loss of revenue, and there'd be fewer rooms available in the end.  (I think.  I'm a CPA, not an architect, but to my amateur eyes, it does not look like it'd be an easy remodel.)  Sorry.  HGTV moment.  Where was I?   Also like old money, this place can be cheap in irritating ways.  $15 (or more) for internet in your room, and wired at that, so no surfing while sitting in bed.  $7 for an hour for internet in the lobby.  WTF?  On the one hand, if I lived in Chicago, and the lobby had free internet, I'd be inclined to take up space there quite often.  On the other hand, $7 for an hour of internet in the lobby??   I've never been somewhere where internet in the lobby came at a price.   (There was too much stone for my T-Mobile smart phone to get any signal.  Which meant I missed a couple calls.  Grr.) Thanks to Yelp I was forewarned about early check-in fees and late check-out fees.  I was honestly surprised that storing my luggage didn't come with a fee.   I didn't interact much with the staff, but they seemed very professional, especially at the front desk.  (I'd put my hotel room keycard behind the magnet closure in my purse, so I had to get it re-programmed at 1:00am.  They asked for ID, which is reassuring, for safety reasons.) I'm glad I came here, at least once.  The public areas are beautiful, and I like pretty architecture.  I probably wouldn't seek it out again as a place to stay, though.  I would, however, definitely be willing to meet people in the lobby for cocktails.  As long as we didn't expect to use our cell phones to find each other.;3;3;3;5;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2191;1/28/2010;BdGSipi3nBmbrWDV;uL-ECTF9PumWkzxHScw-QA;I reviewed my reviews and can't believe I'd never reviewed this place.  This is my favorite place to stay in Chicago.   It is absolutely stately.  I feel like I'm staying with "history and elegance" every time I'm here.  I get a nice corporate rate.  You can't beat the location, so close to the El.  The other reviews do a nice job of describing the beauty. Finally, please pay attention to this simple tip: Get your Hilton Honors number before you stay here and be sure you present it before you check in, everytime.  The points add up quick in a high dollar place like this.  Once you get Diamond status, you are comp'd to the Executive Level, where you get free breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres.  You get your own elevator (down stairs) that goes express to the upper levels.  The view of the lake is phenomenal from the breakfast room. This is a grande dame from another era, still breathing life into the Loop.  Stay here once, regardless of the cost.;5;5;3;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2192;10/21/2009;jed;YT-tCQkmqqPJKQeCFGegFQ;I lived in Chicago for a few years between high school and college (sometime shortly after Gutenberg had printed his first Bible).  I was too young and too poor to enjoy many of the places I would have liked, so when I registered for a huge scientific meeting in Chicago I chose The Palmer House as my hotel. When I was explaining my choice to some colleagues I told them that it used to be very elegant, but now was a little worn and frayed around the edges and the plumbing was a little iffy.  One of the younger members of the group said "That sounds just like you, Dr. Rick" to which someone added "When the hell was Rick ever elegant?". The service was perfect and the room, albeit small compared to newer hotels, was very comfortable and quiet.  I have a 3G wireless widget  for my computer, so I didn't have to pay for their expensive Internet connection.  A coffee pot would have been nice in the room, but there's a Starbucks on the street level.  All in all, my stay was pleasant and since it's so close to the museums and other downtown attractions I'd stay there again if I had more time to enjoy the city.;3;4;3;3;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2193;5/16/2010;MPq33N;0jQDOstEQECkL9ylX4bwDA;-1 star for no mini bar or mini fridge in the room. The BEST part about staying in a hotel room (other than having your bed made for you) is raping the mini bar!! -1 star for no wireless internet in the room. I will not be subjected to sitting stationary at a desk when there is a perfectly good bed from which to surf the net from. A lot of business people stay here and it is 2010...get with it Hilton! -1 star for no airport shuttle! Total bummer, and less expensive establishments general provide this service! Other than those major complaints, this hotel is GORGEOUS! The reception/bar area is decorated classically. The rooms were large, clean, and didn't make you feel like you were sleeping in a hotel straight out of the 80s and the hotel is in a great location very close to Millennium Park! For some reason it was hard to get a hold of the concierge and I was put on hold more than once for longer than I deem appropriate at such a hotel. Twice I even hung up and called back and got an answering machine rather than a real person! Me thinks they need to hire more staff! I also requested that a wireless internet bridge be delivered to my room when one became available:a request that was ignored and never followed up on to explain whether there was availability or not. Boo for customer service. On the plus side there is a full service Starbucks on the ground floor which saved my life - twice! However, next time I'm in town, I'll most likely be staying elsewhere...;2;3;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2194;10/2/2009;9T9jysrm5fqsoKda5iffjw;jHmlmozty9ifc9qjkuHsoA;Despite the fact that the lobby is quite nice, my room is huge, and I got a reasonably priced air/hotel package, I just can't give this hotel more than 2 stars. I'm writing this review from my hotel room, and am paying $14.95 a day for the internet connection. I guess that's not so unusual, and at least there are three differently priced connection options based on speed (I went for the cheapest). But I just feel nickel-and-dimed! It really started with the $25 extra fee for early check-in (about noon). I've never heard of that before. Kind of ticked me off right when I got here. I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge room. But was very surprised to find a teeny tiny bathroom, especially given the size of the room. The bathroom is so small, that even though I am the only person in my huge hotel room, I can barely get into the bathroom and have to squeeze around the door, then shut the door to have room to stand at the sink, or anything else. But first I have to get the light to turn on, so it is not pitch black when I close the bathroom door. This is a major production since it is kind of stuck in the "off" position. To add insult to injury, although there is a magnifying mirror attached to the wall (the kind you can use to put on makeup extra-carefully), it's attached at a height designed for someone about 6 feet tall! Since I'm 4'11", I can't actually see myself in the mirror. It just taunts me by being there. On to the actual room. Clean. Comfortable. Wait, why am I only giving this hotel 2 stars? Well, there is no coffee maker! I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where there wasn't a small coffee set in the room. I guess they want me to buy the starbucks in the lobby instead. But I was kind of counting on the coffee set to heat hot water, so I could make my Trader Joe's instant oatmeal packet in the morning for breakfast. Hmmm. I guess they'd rather I bought the hotel oatmeal for $5 a bowl. And I also guess I could ask for a coffee set to be brought to my room. Would only cost $8. *sigh* Well, at least I brought workout clothes for the 4 days I'm staying here. At $18 per day (or $45 per 3 days), it's a bit pricey just to be able to work out for a few days, but at least I'll be able to use the spa amenities too, right?. Well, luckily I checked out the fitness center before paying, because I just don't like it. Most folks would probably like it fine, but the elliptical machines (only thing I use) here are *again* made for someone 6 feet tall, not someone my size. And the spa amenities aren't all that appealing. And since there are no 24 hr fitness locations nearby (I'm a member), I guess I brought my workout clothes for no good reason other than to use up the space in my luggage. Okay, this review is getting kind of long, and a bit too whiney. So for my last issue with this hotel - I tried calling the "guest service hotline" several different times since I've been here to ask some questions, but I don't think they actually staff the "hotline". On four different attempts, I only once reached an actual person, and I let it ring about 20 times each attempt before giving up. Last night all I wanted to know was where I could get some ice. When they finally directed me to the room with an icemaker (near the elevator), it was a room with peeling paint, cracks on the wall, and a flickering lightbulb. Yech. Tonight I wanted to ask some questions about getting back to the airport. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.;2;9;2;2;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2195;11/8/2010;1V;5qDIr_wCCoLMrHDHoB_pNQ;I would totally stay here again if I got another sweet deal via Priceline or such. Go lower than you'd think! It's got a happening lobby where the bar and restaurant are integrated and it's energetic to say the least, even on Thursday nights. Old school glam... our double had two full bathrooms included, and the materials are heavy, rich fabrics. *I'd avoid valet if you can... you can park 24 hours and go in and out as much as you'd like, but it's $51.;4;1;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2196;7/15/2011;pkiTLtTXnRTxU9XuI0H38g;7AHCbe8w6l9i9q1M3TWfjw;I stayed here over the weekend while in town for the Dave Matthews Caravan.  I noticed that rooms were going for 200+ a night, however, my friend got an amazing deal on Priceline for 90 bucks/night. When you walked into the room, instantly, I knew why the room was so inexpensive.  They gave us a queen size bed after informing us that they were all out of king sizes (we had a late check-in).  The bed seemed to take up the entire room.  When I looked out  the window, my "view" consisted of brick walls and the windows of other rooms.  I now realized why other rooms had their curtains drawn. The bathroom was fairly large, however, we couldn't get the stopper to stay up and keep the bathtub from filling with water, not to mention the fact that the the bathroom had no ventilation of any kind, which makes for a pretty stinky deal, if you catch my drift (pun intended). All in all, the room served its purpose: Sleeping, showering and changing for a very short stint in Chicago.  If I were on "vacation", I would have definitely opted to upgrade to a suite for a more comfortable stay.   The pros of the hotel: Nice bar, lobby/lounge area, Starbucks is conveniently located downstars.  It was conveniently central to everything: Millennium Park, Grant Park, a few blocks walking distance from Magnificent Mile. However, the best part about this hotel: It had a UPS connected to one of its South entrances, which was open on Sunday!  I ended up getting stamps and sending postcards to family, as well as mailed a t-shirt I had purchased for my niece.  That UPS was the saving grace of my trip.  Had it not been open, I'm sure the t-shirt would still be sitting in the corner of my room, a miserable heap, begging to be shipped to a pretty princess in San Diego.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

My room is huge - but I heard some of my coworkers complaining about small rooms.  Maybe I just lucked out.  It also has great decor, and the beds are oh so comfortable.  The mirror in the bathroom is lit from the back - so it's excellent for getting ready.

2198;7/8/2010;qENwuXJ4;qExR8NN0q7PZBQpNOL_VZw;Really pretty hotel! Walking in and seeing the reception/ bar area it's rather breath taking. Painted ceilings and just really pretty architecture inside. The halls to the rooms are a bit confusing as we got lost on our first go round, but all the maids in the hallways working were super friendly and directed us correctly. The room was really cute and very spacious. We had a double bed room and it also came with desk, a large comfy chair and ottoman. TV was old school CRT but no big deal. I peeked into other rooms as we would walk around the halls and some were not nearly as large and others appeared to have rooms within rooms. Bathroom was pretty standard and the tub made me feel claustrophobic without a curved shower rod. The bed was comfortable and I really liked all the decor of the hotel inside rooms and inside the halls. We had an issue with the shower and the maintenance guy came right away and we also got extra towels very quickly after requested. Concierge was super helpful and friendly and booked us our tour bus tickets online to save us 10%. Also, great people watching in the bar area. Careful though, I got caught checking someone out. http://Embarassed.com I enjoyed my brief stay here and found the location to be very convenient.;4;2;3;3;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

As I type this review, I am sitting in my room at the Palmer House Hilton.  I am in Chicago on business, and found this hotel after checking hhonors because the W (the preferred hotel in Chicago) was sold out.   Overall, the room is very nice, albeit very small (on the 13th floor).  The lobby is huge, and reminds me a lot of the Westin St. Francis or the Sir Francis Drake back in SF.  It has that "blue hair appeal" that makes a 28 year old feel a bit out of place.  If you're into flirting with GILF's or something, this place is a goldmine.  The hotel staff are polite and helpful.  The bathroom is the size of an iphone, at least the one in my room is.  If you stay here, ask for the state/adams side rather than the monroe/wabash side so you don't have to listen to the L trains every few mins.  This side is much quieter. I'd stay here again (especially with the double points hhonors promo), but this definitely isn't my favorite hotel on earth.  Its a clean, nice, and moderately opulent hotel suitable for its 250/night price.;4;2;0;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2201;7/5/2008;C;l2xCVVInBHnHjj2YrL5vig;Like many http://tripadvisor.com reviewers said, the walls at the Palmer House are paper-thin. I was awakened by my neighbors' coital activity. Not my idea of a morning call.  And I stayed in the renovated room. Aren't things suppose to improve with renovations? I'm with Jenelle. While the lobby is gorgeous, I'm not resting my head there. I love gawking at hotels, but ultimately, what rates the hotel is its comfort and location. The Palmer House merits its 3 stars with its comfortable bed, tightly-drawn curtains and location. A short walk to Michigan Avenue, Millenium Park, Art Institute and the Theater District. What more could one ask for, except a little more quiet, unless that wink-wink-nudge-nudge sound system is your kind of thing.;3;1;0;3;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2202;1/25/2011;JUmxjfcfXLrO4z9YqEkWiQ;8cbOxBe4Lx13EIY3KCzUDQ;The pros- Excellent lobby, everyone that works at the hotel is very nice and will take care of any problem you have quickly.  You can't argue with the location and with that comes a heavy price tag.  I can't complain about the actual price for the room but all the extra add ons really get you.  Its 25 extra for a third person in the room.  Thats a bit much.   Internet was 15, I didn't use it since I have a smart phone but 15 for internet is def. on the high end.   I had no issue with the room, bed was really nice and bathroom decent. The cons-You hear everything that happens on your floor, from someone flushing the toilet to entering their room.  This is one of the loudest hotels I have stayed at.   And when you pay around 300 a night, it would be nice to actually get a few hours of sleep.;2;0;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2206;7/17/2010;vp0eumnnkQec8aXLR2wkCA;3nD6vua8JAQq-AKViepVow;I spent a few years working in hotels before moving becoming a meeting planner so I feel like I can give a fair judgment of a hotel and I am just not sure I would return to the Palmer House. I understand it's a historic hotel, however I was in room 21-167 and beside the room being the smallest hotel room I've ever been in I don't think it was maintained very well. The carpet is worn and and needs replacing (felt the same about the hall and elevator landing) There was black hair on the shower walls, mildew on the shower grout, trash BEHIND the trash can in the bathroom, and it looked like the bath amenities had been used and not replaced. The woman who checked me was was in training according to the badge she was wearing but it took her forever to check me in, she didn't say more than 2 words to me so it was mostly awkward silence. The remote in my room didn't work and when engineering came up with a 2nd one that didn't work. I was told that they were in the middle of a shift change so someone else would have to come up and it took almost 30 mins, that guy brought a remote & did something to the TV before telling me it was fixed (I was working at the desk). However, when I went to turn the TV off the 3rd remote wasn't working either. Because I arrived at 1:30pm, left at 4pm, returned at midnight and went straight to bed, got up at 6 am and left at 6:30 for a flight I didn't say anything to the hotel, it just wasn't worth the hassle of moving. However, if I had been there any longer I would have complained to the front desk. No wireless Internet in the guest rooms. They get 3 stars because: Convenient location, the doorman who got me the cab to get to the airport was very friendly, and the 3rd star out of hope that I just had an off experience. The hotel has a ton of history in it and has been around forever, plus it's a Hilton which is an overall good brand.;3;1;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2207;2/17/2009;8W51WfdSQ--C8jp-yWwGOw;FZTkBavnUWVQRK3ULOxePQ;I'm going to give Palmer House three stars, due to the fact that our stay there was just over a year ago, and a few things have changed since then (which I just learned of when booking another room for next month).   If you will note the photos that we just uploaded, Palmer House doesn't look like that anymore, nor does the Lockwood Restaurant and Bar look like that anymore.   As they have completely remodeled.   And another thing of note is that Chicago imposed an indoor smoking ban just about a year ago.     While the hotel was most certainly grand, like 3 star (on a scale of 1-3), luxury abounding, I'm not staggeringly impressed by that sort of stuff anymore as I have seen enough of it.    But it's nice if you are with your wife.     We arrived at 11pm and while I had reserved a NON-SMOKING room, apparently they were having a large convention and I suspect they gave away my room.    I had a room number and they gave me a new one.   And what was it?   A smoking room.   I was told that was the last room left (which was likely not true) or they just bumped me as we arrived late in the evening.     I was like "Oh fuck me..."     And since we didn't feel like trying to find somewhere else to stay, having just valet parked our rental car, we decided to just stay.   Upon entering the room it did in fact smell like a pink sheet trader had been chain smoking stogies.   Revolting.   And I say that as a man that enjoys a cigar after drinks.    It was just stagnant.    Horrible I tell you.   I complained when I checked out, complained on the phone when getting back home a few days later, and Hilton never offered to make amends for this in any way.    And to be honest I don't remember if I called my credit card company or not, I don't think I did, but they probably would have covered me, as this was not what I ordered.   Regardless of this initial bad experience, due to the history and location, we will be staying there again.   But this time I told them that if you stick us in a smoking room again, I ain't paying for it!;3;2;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I hadn't been to the Palmer House since I was a kid until this week for a work event.  I have to say, it was one of the nicest work events that I've been to.  From what I could see, everything was done beautifully.  The meeting rooms/ball rooms we used were beautiful.  The coordination of moving a large group through the hotel was done nicely - with staff members directing the group.   The sound for the meeting and the band later was fantastic.  Everything was set up nicely in terms of food, bars, dance floor, tables.   Based upon the fact that most people stayed until the end of the night - dancing up a storm, I think that the party was a success and I think it was a great venue!;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2210;7/28/2010;x36qTpNB01HH64sb;i-Ry197kaQ3xuQKkN5nksQ;Gorgeous hotel, holy crap.  I was pretty in awe when I walked in the doors.  The location is truly wonderful and central.  The staff was very professional and helpful. I've stayed in quite a few hotels while in Chicago, both upscale and not-so-much, and this one has been my favorite.   My only complaint is the layout is a bit confusing and took me about 1.5 days to figure out.;4;1;0;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2211;8/21/2010;pdM8-iPF;eXPjio3AjM0gjSyXyCZJmg;I stayed here last summer after booking a room for $89 on Hotwire.  I've come to be a little wary of using Hotwire for booking nice city hotels, as you occasionally get crammed into the tiniest room on site - but in this case, they offered me an upgrade to the executive floor for $20 or $30 and I jumped all over that.  For the small cost of an upgrade, you get to ride the fancy schmancy executive elevator and have free snacks, sodas, and appetizers in the evening.  It was money well spent.   Overall, the hotel is stunning.  It's one of those grand old hotels where the building is sturdy and glamorous, even if a few things seem slightly outdated.  The service was great and I didn't notice any significant amount of noise during the stay. The only minor flaw in the whole experience was the breakfast.  It was fairly pricey given the quality of food served, but it was still good - and the atmosphere of their restaurant is very opulent, too.   Although I love sampling lots of different hotels in every city I visit, I would definitely return to the Palmer House on a future trip.;5;1;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2212;8/30/2009;rFY5ldLOMDdB1e-U;DWd0JhbCcvzqq7yc02hByA;Gorgeous hotel! I loved staying here - thanks to good ole Priceline bidding for $65/night. Nice. Valet w/ In & Out privileges for $51? Not so nice. But self-parking at their lot is just a few steps away for $36. My dad chose to park a block away for $25 all day/night. Internet is also $15. I'd rate this 3.5, but will give it 4 instead of 3 because it's so pretty inside. I'm easily swooned by this type of decor. We stayed here for the sole purpose of sleeping - I didn't even get a chance to see the pool or anything else. We road tripped from Houston to Chicago to Niagara Falls all within a week! Our room on the 21st floor wasn't small, we were in a corner room so one view was skyscrapers, the other Millennium Park. No complaints regarding room size/view! I didn't realize we were right next to the train tracks, but the sounds didn't really bother us. We got settled in around 9 PM on a weekday, didn't know where to dine or what was open, so we just wandered and hoped to find something. Sadly, most restaurants were closed or closing by then and the few places I had wanted to eat (via Yelp reviews) were too far. I'm definitely researching more in advance next time! The bellhops were all really nice - taking bags to the room once we were settled in, storing our luggage, etc. I saw the receptionist offer everyone else in line bottled water - but didn't offer us any! Concierge was not helpful when we were trying to find information about Chicago Trolley tours. She just said "wait at CVS and you'll see someone there." No one was there! Luckily, the Palmer House is one of their stops and we were able to get on when it stopped at the light. The Corner Bakery Cafe is right next to the hotel, so we ate there for breakfast before going on our tour! I don't think I'll be paying $4 for a banana at the hotel restaurant anytime soon.. If you do want to eat at Lockwood & if the bellhop brings your bags up, they should offer you a 20% off coupon to Lockwood. I'm totally in love with Chicago now (visiting in the summer helps) and I would definitely stay here again if I got this deal.;4;1;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2213;7/19/2008;brhwRDXS8i3qjxseEU14Pg;r5SGbKHQyXeOxgdHGKeZJQ;I was here for a conference and if I had a choice, I would never have come back again.  Granted, it had a nice lobby and had a great sense of history to it, but it wasn't worth the 300 a night. I wasn't staying in the lobby, I was staying in some tiny little room that has a television off to the side so you had to strain your neck to watch it.  It had only TWO towels per room (what if we want to take more than one shower a day?).  The pillows were flat and the walls were incredibly thin.  It was hard to fall sleep and stay asleep as the hallways can be really loud.  Also, the maid service knocks on your door at exactly 8 in the morning to try to clean your room.   All this might have been forgivable if they didn't try to nickel and dime you every  moment.  They charged an extra fee for internet service and they charged you 15 dollars to use the gym.  They were also undergoing renovations so there was only one entrance from the street.  Not the greatest hotel experience, but I guess it was slightly better than motel 6.;2;2;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2214;3/24/2011;V3QHIPQTNGGjirLksXQUDA;8-FNmYDI-Roa-D3rGGMvSQ;I stayed in a room with double queens. The room itself was big and had 2 closets.  The bathroom was tiny! You could barely close the door without getting stuck between the door and the toilet, haha. The rooms were always clean when we returned, with fresh towels.  One time, though, we came back and our bathroom didn't look clean.  Turns out, the toilet stopped up.  My mom called the front desk who immediately sent Maintenance.  He knocked on our door within 5 minutes, fixed the toilet in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later housekeeping knocked on our door, apologized about the mess and the toilet and cleaned our bathroom.  5 stars for maintenance/housekeeping! This place is already on the expensive side and everything else was an additional charge (for a nominal fee). Can't they just say the nominal fee is going to be an arm and a leg? I had every intention to workout at the fitness center until I saw that you had to pay a nominal fee to get in the there. We decided to try out the hotel.  And I had an expedia ticket of $10 off a night.  We weren't impressed enough to return. Convenient phone/tv checkout to avoid the front desk. Starbucks at the street level. Door men who look fancy but don't really do much.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The concierge staff were very attentive, great room service, although a bit pricey but the food was great....though do not use the business center and gym, you have to pay for the service (WHAT!?!?). I very much enjoy my room on the 29th floor, the only down side was the bathroom was on the small side and very little counter space.;4;1;1;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2217;6/21/2010;j1mW0ycVQG0wUW4wLW;IGhepIyCDPaZkNonWvceLA;The Palmer House was my go-to hotel in Chicago for several years. I'm not so hot about it anymore. Here are the goods and bads: THE GOOD: Great location in the loop. 1-2 blocks from all El lines. Walk to clients, restaurants, theaters, museums, etc. Old school decor and charm with a beautiful lobby. Many rooms are reasonably large (though if you scrounge for the cheapest rate it's on one of the tiny ones). Good prices at times. Stayed 3 nights around New Year's Eve for about 300 all-in. THE BAD: "Old school decor" also means poor room lighting and tiny bathrooms. Deteriorating service for Hilton HHonors members. Staff takes an attitude of, "We've provided the minimum guaranteed benefits, and that's all you're going to get." It's a shame because they used to go the extra mile.  Prices are often high (200+/night) at which point there are usually better values elsewhere downtown.;3;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2218;10/25/2006;5dF-cQNtgV9VG-GJ1LQRdA;n1rvxZn1ynX9g7kesNOHIw;I didn't stay here, but I love this hotel. I can only imagine, based on the common and conference spaces I've been in over the last two days, what the rooms are like. The lobby is beautiful. Look at the ceiling and fixtures. Breathe it in. Sit a spell. And the conference areas are solid. The catered food is good, and the coffee strong. And the wifi? Provided by the conference organizers, sure, but the signal has been strong in almost every single room I've been in, even the breakout session rooms with awkward pillar-dominated designs. Minus one star because the traffic flow for stairs and escalators isn't always clear. Outside of using the elevators, the floors don't connect well, and it can be hard to find your way around.;4;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2219;5/13/2007;jxJ-aquB-o9gt41ZI-;M1YMMS7FcggrMog8fL9h7Q;Gorgeous foyer. Clean rooms. SMALL rooms. I prefer River North, except for the proximity to Grant Park and the ArtIC And there's a FANTASTIC Chop House in the same street (Something Chop House and Wine Bar.... hmmm... When I remember it I'll post it back), but seriously, it's in the same street (perpendicular to the lake, not parallel) and it's got THE BEST stuffed mozzarella appetizers. I still drool at them. And evidently they have really good steak.  But again, this comment is lost on me...;2;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2221;3/12/2009;L6nFEVCqjJ;Vo1MmLAw2rpmblZ9wh3TCA;I'm staying at the Palmer House because I have to. And I wish I didn't have to. This hotel is fine, corporate America fine. But it is a big barn with Fraternity and Sorority conferences, business meetings, and all sorts of madness. The rooms are inconsistent, some being really, really cozy for two adults. Even tiny adults like me and my beloved. I highly recommend the upgrade to the "executive floor" where the rooms are huge and you are afforded the luxury of express elevators, free breakfast and round the clock snacks and drinks. What really irks me about this place (aside from the scripted corporate speak of the employees [that irks me everywhere]) is all the ridiculous surcharges. $25 to check in early. $20 per day for internet. $18 to use the pool. $20 to use the gym. Really? So what exactly are the amenities of the hotel? Clearly, this place has a lot of rooms to fill in order to pay the wintertime heating bill. It makes me feel like I'm being swindled, and I'm not even paying for my room! For a little more money, there are better options, and better locations in Chi-town.;2;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Is it a hotel for business travelers or a swanky couples getaway? It can't seem to decide and my fear is that it does neither very well. Upsides? Great central location one block from the train. Spectacular lobby! Comfortable beds/linens. Friendly staff. Downsides? $20 a day for Internet? Even on the executive floors. No wifi in the room. I was stuck in my room working for two days. I couldn't move my laptop and the chair was too low for the desk. Not comfortable. $18 a day for the gym? C'mon! Even on an expense account, I could not justify that. Bad food. Granted, I didn't try the restaurant. I was here on business and I always order room service. Point me to a hotel that serves good, relatively healthy food in my room and I'll be thrilled. Also, I don't know if it was because it's low, low season in Chicago, but there were rarely staff at the concierge desks. I was more effective helping myself on the Internet the one day I ventured out. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers.;2;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2223;10/26/2008;gi;lIpTgVs3Jpor4ciOR7A-vQ;My husband and I had our wedding in the Empire Room in August. Dennis Chaffee is extremely accomodating, organized, professional, reliable, and easy to contact. He gave priceless advice. It is obvious that he is very experienced. No request was too much to ask!  The majority of our guests booked rooms at the hotel- he made sure that all of the rooms were available as early as possible. The dinner was absolutely outstanding!  Many of the guests remarked that it was the "best wedding food" they have ever had. We served halibut and filet. Dennis personally stayed the majority of the wedding to ensure that everything on time and running as smooth as possible.  Thank you Palmer House and Dennis Chaffee!

The pros - in the Loop, right on the brown line, some rooms have two full bathrooms which is soooo nice, great staff and beautiful lobby. The cons - preeeetttty sure our room wasn't cleaned before we checked in (dirty towels, used dry cleaning bags on the closet floor, popcorn on the floor, etc). The rooms are kinda dated. The bathrooms are fine but the rooms themselves are just old with older fixtures and a tv I had probably in 1997. All that being said, I have to give it 4-stars as if we were going back to Chicago tomorrow, we'd pick to stay at the Palmer House again. Its just easy and in our price range.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

They have free cookies and cokes and other snackies. The best part about it is it's not supervised, so I was able to load up on all the free sweets. Made my day. The room she had was quite nice. The interesting thing was that her room had two beds and two bathrooms. I've never had a hotel room with two bathrooms. Very unusual. It turned out to be considerably convenient since her friend shared the room with her. I am told the price of the room was very reasonable. It's right in the heart of downtown.

The interior is aesthetically gorgeous, our upper-floor corner room modern (with the exception of the TV from the 90's), the location is excellent (just a few blocks from Millennium Park), the service is fantastic (from doormen, concierge, to maids and room service), and the Lockwood Restaurant inside is fantastic (we were given a complimentary 20% off coupon upon check-in to try "the most romantic restaurant in Chicago"). The girlfriend enjoyed the stay as well. Only downsides: - The business center is small, computers outdated, and charges for internet and printing. - The pool is small and the stench of chlorine was overwhelming. Even so, I am giving this four-star hotel five-stars. Would definitely return again.;5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2231;12/9/2009;4noQQlhBTjMU99ywuLcYjw;QZNLJ68kuS51Tlqljvf3ow;This place is exceptional, a true Chicago landmark, I had not been in the property for two year - or since the renovation was completed. It has been restored to one of the finest properties in the entire world. The outside remains the same, but when you get into the lobby it is fantastic. Especially when decorated for Christmas. We are using the family picture shot in front of the tree for our card this year, and it was almost non-stop picture taking from everyone who walked by the tree. After we checked in (more on that in a minute) we had to go have a drink in the lobby. The bar is cozy and is in/out of the restaurant, and there are plenty of tables and chairs to sit in the lobby itself. It was awesome just to take in the view and enjoy a drink....we almost stayed for another but had to head out for dinner. With the location of the property (State Street in the theatre district/a block from Millennium Park) this is a MUST STAY while in Chicago. As for the room, the general manager Dean Lane really took care of my family. He put us in the best room I have ever stayed in (The Daley Suite) right on the parade route/State Street, and had a bottle of wine and cookies and milk for the kids in the room. Nicest gesture of the year based on all the nights I have spent in hotel rooms this year. Even without this special treatment I would stay here every time downtown!!!!!;5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2232;2/25/2009;zSaFtStz3kjyLqWZEuoH9g;6dpK66Y1aQne--Zmw5xEcw;Since the recent major renovation project, Palmer House has looked even more phenomenal than before. Very classy and decadent in it's interior decor, it's a mix of the old with the new. Any personality can take light of the intimacy and nostalgia the lobby brings. A competent bar and restaurant awaits you on both sides of the main lobby, with reception very close by, and an excellent concierge service. Room service will take a toll on your wallet, but at a place like this - you shouldn't be at all surprised. The room rates and size vary according to how much you can pay, so expect to show some franklins if you wish to accommodate a large number of individuals to stay. This definitely isn't a motel six where you can cram a family of five for 80 bucks. My only gripe with the hotel is how the rooms are laid out. It can be a bit of a hassle to reach your final destination - your room. You'd think it was enough to fly, go through security checks, possibly experience the dreaded and inconsistent el from either O'Hare or Midway... but no. It doesn't end when you pick up your room keys. Let's just say I wouldn't want to have a serial killer after me. I'd totally get lost. Overall, an excellent hotel with great customer service, very convenient location (practically in the heart of downtown), and the historical landmark that it is to boot.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2234;6/29/2010;6apqBr9rOqHSrKGWeCVY8g;6DmjbYpsxz8MUSSXeX4PAw;The hotel in general is a bit of a mixed bag. On the plus side as other reviewers have stated the hotel is absolutely gorgeous and truly reflects the early gilded age luxury it was built for. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals. Staying in downtown chicago I thought there would be a good variety of selection for food, however outside of a pizza place one block away, and a hot dog place 5 blocks away everything consisted of the same recurrent chains every block - you will see at least one of these every 2 blocks: subway, mcdonalds, 7/11, cvs, starbucks - outside of that and the two independently run places i mentioned earlier the closest thing is a trip to the greek section which is about 2 miles away.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The one con with the hotel was that the room was TINY.  It's the smallest hotel room I've ever been in!  But I guess being in the City, you're not going to spending much time in the room anyways.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

However, we found our room to be too small - there was really no space at all to even walk around.  The bed was so soft my husband opted to sleep on the floor one night.  The concierge helped us out a lot, but you can't reach them by phone - it just keeps ringing.  And for some weird reason, the stores cannot give you any change - they are not allowed and you HAVE to ask the hotel staff for change.  Weird.  I think the price is too high considering the cons.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

We had stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker for the first three nights of our Chicago trip because that was where my husband's conference was. We had to change hotels when the Hyatt couldn't accommodated a longer stay. This turned out to be such a blessing! The Palmer made the Hyatt look like a grossly overpriced dump. Our one year old son's knees were filthy from crawling on the floors at the 'newly renovated' Hyatt. His knees were pristine while at the historical Palmer. Also, there were five - yes five! - weddings on the Saturday of our stay, so the hotel was very busy. Even with that, we had no noisy neighbors disturb our son's naps or sleep at night. The building is stunning. Our room was huge (which might be because we agreed to take a smoking room, which was fume-free after leaving the window open a while we out exploring the city). And we got a mind-boggling fantastic deal on our room through Priceline.;5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Obviously I have special needs with my disability yet the job to accommodate that was feeble at best. The bathrooms are small and few & difficult to navigate. There are even stairs and NO ramp to one of the main lounges featured bar. Top it off this is the downstairs.. Now Imagine how bad the rooms are for the disabled. They charge for everything.... the wifi even in the main lobby has a ridiculous fee. Lets not even get me started with the parking... LOL With the "rich history" comes a lack of vision toward the future. The atmosphere was stimulating & stuffy. The people were down to earth but yet on another planet.

It was stunning - a huge room with a marble fireplace - so elegant.  The ballroom is right outside of Potter's Lounge, very classy, hip lounge which we would have used for the cocktail hour prior to going to dinner in the ballroom.  You notice I say "would have" - so very sad. The wedding coordinator there met with us, showed us everything, provided some initial pricing and then NEVER got back to my daughter-in-law with a proposal.  I could not believe it.  She actually had the nerve to contact me at work about 4 weeks after we met with her to see if we were still interested!  Anyway, as pretty as the Palmer House was, my son and his gorgeous wife just held their reception at the W Lakeshore and it was awesome!   So, great historic hotel - very poor follow-up!;4;2;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

We both ordered the same service but received different treatments that were not consistent in time or  content.

I love that they use CFL bubs in the rooms. Also, they have notes about the sheets and that they try to conserve water by washing them only when requested. Environmentally responsible.

A little tidbit of trivia: it was originally built in 1871, but burned down 13 days later in the Great Chicago Fire. It was then rebuilt, apparently "fireproof," making it one of the oldest hotels in the country. The interior has absolutely gorgeous vintage opulence. There is a bar in the lobby area, as well as a newly renovated "Potter's Bar" (which used to be Trader Vic's, the oldest Tiki bar in Chicago).

Very small.  But, okay, the Palmer House has been there since, when?  the late 1800's?  So I'll excuse the size of the room.  Decorating? Gauche. And NO FAN in the BATHROOM!  Imagine three women trying to shower, change, do hair in a postage stamp room when there's no fan in the bathroom.  All of the mirrors were fogged over.  NOT good.   After the event, I was ready for a great night's sleep. It was around 12:30 when I crawled into bed. At 1:45, someone started banging on the door across the hall, and yelling for "LaShonda" to wake up.  this went on for about three minutes, and, just as I was about to call security, LaShonda got out of bed, opened the door, explained that she was drunk and had puked all over the place, and let the door banger in.  I fell asleep again at about 2:30.  At 4AM, the guy in the room next to me decided it was time to call Mike and see if they could "get some women."  Bill, the other guy in Mike's friend's room, kept saying, "It's 4 o'clock in the morning." But Mike's friend, apparently had a deep need for a woman.  I didn't know whether to call the front desk or yell through the wall the suggestion that Mike's friend and Bill go across the hall and get LaShonda.  After about ten minutes, I heard the door bang and Bill and Mike's friend headed out onto the mean streets of Chicago to look for women.  Then, at about 7, the families started trundling down the hall with their wheeled suitcases and squeaky-voiced children.  This eventful night at the Palmer House set my company back $321.  Maybe they have extremely nice suites available for more than that, with sound proofing that really keeps you from hearing about LaShonda's puking or Mike's friend's need for women, but I would not go back. Ever.  We complained to the management, and they were unmoved.  So, in this case, you get 'way less than you pay for. Does not live up to hype or its storied history.;2;1;0;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Here's the thing... the drinks are expensive, the service isn't great, and the food options are small... but none of that matters.  Because you come here for one reason and one reason only.  The atmosphere.  It's a kick ass old hotel with a million things to look at on the ceiling alone.  I love sitting in those tall back chairs, sipping on a scotch, and catching up with a friend.  If you haven't ever been here I highly recommend you visit.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2276;5/28/2008;QrZNolvEyu2sX;ToQVnVLbSRW1TBpHDHBRlw;We hesitantly booked through one of those discount hotel websites, boy were we surprised at the outcome. When we arrived we were bumped up to the executive towers, with private express elevators and lounge. The lounge had complimentary hors d'oeuvres each night, non-alcoholic beverages throughout the day, a wonderful breakfast and a private concierge. It has been quite sometime since we have had such an amazing experience at a hotel. The one downside was a pool under renovation.;5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I fell in love with Chicago, probably because of how well we were taken care of here. We had one of the fancy pants suites, so we had two beds, a couch, two bathrooms, our own TV, a lot of nice things. We did not get BRAVO though, which severely hampered our ability to watch Top Chef. No matter, the complimentary breakfast and late night snacks made up for it. All the cranberry juice I could drink! The location is wonderful, in the downtown of Chicago, just a short distance from The Art Institute of Chicago Museum. I am certain there are cheaper places, but I really liked where we were.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I got a suite which had two bathrooms and two closets. Bathrooms are all marble and relatively small in size. Hotel has tons of parking garage around it and is only a block from millennium park. I am not a Hilton fan and this hotel was definitely a breath of fresh air. Will definitely stay here again on next visit if i get the same deal again;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2281;3/6/2011;jVdAseruqGHb;klIJ9Erlc03JM75KLvnUvw;I booked this hotel via Priceline and I was very impressed with the hotel when I arrived. The lobby was beautiful and the gentleman at the front desk was very professional and friendly.  Initially my 9th floor room was very spacious and well decorated. Unfortunately I had an uninvited guest in my room. There was a rather large cockaroach crawling on my bag that was on the floor. I called housekeeping and they killed it and asked if I wanted them to spray the room. I told them I wanted to be moved to a new room. I was moved to the 12th floor and the room was very small, the noise from the El was rather annoying and the bathroom toilet kept running after it was flushed. I was very disappointed at the level of service they showed after the incident I had. I suggest they keep up on there pest control.;2;1;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

On our second night there we experienced problems with some loud partiers next door. We called management and they tried to contact them a few times. Finally, we called again and they asked if they could bring some earplugs to us. We explained that we already had some. Unfortunately, we did not sleep well that night. We would choose a different place to stay the next time we are in Chicago.;2;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The star of this place is the lobby, which is really what all hotel lobbys should be. Beautiful high ceiling was old school without being stuffy. Very cool white marble bar set right in the lobby, not pushed off to a secluded corner. Many leather booths with table service for afternoon tea or late night drinks. Location is not great, particularly on the weekends, athough it is 2 blocks from millenium park, and a block from a bunch of train lines. The low light of the trip was the rooms, small, not particularly modern or lush at all. Service wasn't really great, although that rarely bothers me very much. Corner bakery outside is so-so.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2284;7/16/2010;jy3Bj3wGZ3YLEtswLv5ekQ;bgjIlg-TvdsDFqdCBjA6_A;3.5-The Palmer House will not disappoint you in the realm of aesthetics.  The Palmer House has a beautifully painted ceiling that was restored by one of the same artists that restored the Sistine Chapel ceiling.  The light fixtures and the ambiance is incredible.  You will see bellhops and a few stores in the hotel (including Starbucks).   The negatives go with the rooms mainly.  The room that I stayed in was a little small, and it had a smoke smell even though it was supposed to be non-smoking.  In addition, the bathroom and decor did not look very well kept.   For the price that you pay to stay at this hotel, more amenities should be included in the price.  You will have to pay for wi-fi and the business center. The location of the hotel is convenient.  You can walk to shops and to the Millenium Park to see the Cloud Gate (o.k. no one calls it that...aka the 'silver bean').  I gave it a 3.5 due to these factors.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2285;9/11/2011;lGzF1xP2sT3c0;QrBrQL9-iA1LVOcR6K1pWQ;The hotel interior was beautiful and the staff was friendly.  The walls are very thin since it is an old building and you can hear everything next door and in the hallway, which is a problem if your neighbors get in late and make noise, or if they watch a movie with the volume on.  Beds were comfy and the front desk was friendly.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

2287;11/17/2010;NlmdKg9px1fDh8kuPOeQ-A;3QhuMZBKdz2-fRvVTCWizA;When we got engaged, we planned our wedding almost exactly a year out.  Being a perfectionist and very organized, I started searching through bridal magazines and websites to plan our wedding.  I saw the Palmer House on the first day of looking at venues and knew that was where we would have our wedding.  Looking into the Grand & State Ballrooms just took my breath away.  We got married on Saturday, June 5th, 2010 at the Palmer House Hilton Chicago. We signed our contract with Mark Coy, a sales & catering coordinator at the Palmer House.  While he was pleasant in our meetings and would explain what we would need to do, I never really felt confident in his ability to make our day special.  I always needed to initiate questions to get answers and every meeting felt rushed because he had to be out the door by 6pm.  He always said "no problem" to everything but then there was a huge problem that finally had me in a  bridezilla moment.  In our initial room block we asked Mark to substitute two regular rooms for two suites.  Well, he put five suites on our block.  I had numerous phone calls from my guests that our block was full.  I didn't know until after the fact that each suite was taking 2 regular rooms out of our block.  In our meetings we always discussed increasing the number of rooms on our block as well.  Of course, he said "no problem" based on availability.  Well, a good coordinator would have told his client that the weekend of their wedding was also the largest convention in the city of Chicago.  So when we needed the additional rooms we heard "sorry we're booked".  Never once did he put the fear in our mind that we wouldn't have rooms for our guests.  At that moment I definitely knew that I could not work with someone who obviously could care less about our wedding.  We also had issues with charging of rooms as well.  I think that the rooms manager/department definitely needs some work in this location.  Our parents were charged the suite rate of $329, when they were supposed to be charged $289.  My mother-in-law was paying for her sister's room, but then they charged her sister's credit card.  Being an upscale hotel these issues shouldn't happen. I immediately asked for Jane Himmel to replace our coordinator as I heard she was the best coordinator there.  She is AMAZING and was our wedding angel.  We had set up a meeting for the next week as this was a Friday.  We were actually meeting with our florist on that evening at 6:30pm and she came to this meeting to meet us & go over a few details.  I was astonished that she would meet us on a Friday evening and she stayed until the end which concluded at 9:30pm.  She had to pretty much start from scratch and had two months to put it together.  The next day (Saturday) she emailed us a rough draft of our timeline & had forwarded some spreadsheets to fill out for her which included our parents info & our other vendors.  (The only thing Mark ever emailed me was a sample timeline of an early evening wedding and I am assuming I was to put it together)  She made us feel like she was going to make our wedding special and not just another cookie cutter wedding that our other coordinator was going to put together.  She could tell I was feeling stressed from everything going on and she suggested Claudia Antony, a day of coordinator.  Now, I was feeling great and actually enjoying the final months of wedding planning.         Jane got us back on track with our reception and did more in two weeks than our first coordinator did in almost 10 months.  We are so appreciative for the amount of time and effort on her part to make all of the details of our wedding reception seamlessly play through the night.  She was patient, organized, professional and easily accessible.  She stayed through the majority of our wedding and was relentless in her effort to make us happy.  We couldn't think of favors and she provided us an idea for what we should do.  She guided us through our meal choices, wine choices (as we were not happy with the others offered to us) and came up with a cake option that was magnificent.  She surprised us at our reception with keys to the penthouse for our two day stay, our wedding night & the night after.  She "WOWED" us time after time.  Her job didn't end there as the next day we set up a brunch for 60 people.  She had everything set up beautifully in the Honore Ballroom for the conclusion of our wedding weekend.  Let's just say Jane went above & beyond in all matters pertaining to our wedding.  I am sure there are so many more details that Jane attended to that I couldn't even begin to think about.  I couldn't imagine a more beautiful start to our new life together! Thank you Jane!;5;3;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2288;7/3/2009;3QAolhVcXS4D0zq509wtaA;PKbJuktYilr4meqZ0dNiqQ;This place is worth visiting, even if you're not staying to sleep. You can walk up and see the Red Lacquer room, admire the Sistine Chapel-esque architecture and have your picture taken by a gilded statue near the in-hotel bar. Apparently, it's the oldest standing hotel in North America, and every president since Ulysses S Grant has taken rest there. With help from my friend William Shatner (the Priceline Negotiator dontchaknow) I was able to bag a $250 hotel room for $75 a night, and subsequently upgraded (at an $18 a night charge) to a suite with two bathrooms, because we needed two beds as well. I can't vouch for the restaurant (since I am obviously a cheapskate), but the pool and hot tub were great, and never packed since they were tucked away on the 7th floor. And what other hotel is going to have an entire room for elevators? I would recommend this place if you're able to score a comparable deal, both because of the history and location (zoom into downtown Chicago and you'll find this at its epicenter), but couldn't in good conscience tell you to drop the retail price on a place where you're more or less paying for the legacy.;4;2;1;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2289;4/10/2011;EzJtb8bDBZhleYlEhlr8uw;QlXANrwiDYAuQM9KX2WXAA;Location, Location Location!!  This very historic hotel is a truly unique experience, especially if you are a history buff.  The hotel is only a block away from the Chicago Art Institute and less than two miles from almost all the down town attractions.  We paid a little more and stayed on the executive floor where you receive a continental breakfast, drinks and snacks throughout the day, and appetizers in the evening.  They also have bar service on the floor until 10:00 PM each night.  Don't expect much from the food on the executive floor, it's cereal, muffins, hardboiled eggs and such.  It is really nice to be able to grab a drink without going down to the lobby or paying five bucks for a coke in the vending machine.  However, I wouldn't count breakfast here as a full meal.  The lobby and overall decor of the hotel is phenomenal with authentic Art-Deco styling's.  This isn't faux reproductions as displayed in Vegas or other hotels. It's the real deal.  The current version of the Palmer House opened in 1925 but it's origins date back to 1871.  Even if you don't stay here, stop by and have a martini at the lobby bar.  Soak up the atmosphere around you.  Think of all the history that has passed though this lobby and the people that have had a drink at this bar.  The roaring 20's, Black Friday 1929, WW II, heck it is even quite possible that Al Capone and his henchmen had a drink at this bar.  The rooms are small by modern standards and the bathrooms are very small.  Remember this hotel was built in 1925, and at that time these were large rooms.  The water pressure in the shower was very low but again this is a historic hotel and we were on the top floor.  As with most Hilton properties the bed is very comfortable.  Down pillows and comforters are always a hit in my book.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I feel that the bellmen and doormen outshined the rest of the staff I came in contact with.  They were sincerely friendly, funny and helpful.  During our departure, our bellman ran out into traffic on State Street to hail us a taxi.  It almost looked like a cop commandeering a car during a police chase.  I would most definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone doing the tourist thing in Chicago, especially if you are a history buff.;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2290;11/21/2010;vHQH1eS;3MNWHbdW-BEBe2o_cp7zUw;So, I booked this hotel for me & my husband for 1 night via Priceline.  It was my 1st time to use Priceline so I wasn't totally sure what I was doing.  This hotel is really, really nice.  The entire staff, from the valet, to the bellman, to the concierge, were all so helpful.  Our room....it was very pretty, clean, but the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in!  My husband and I laughed about it, but seriously, I would guess a prison cell is larger!  I'm not even kidding...I think they took a storage closet and thought, "Hmm, we could make a few extra bucks if we put a bed in here".  Again, more than anything, we just thought it was funny.  It was quiet and fairly easy to navigate through the hotel...and this hotel is HUGE.  They said it takes up an entire city block.  We had show tickets for 11pm without dinner reservations and the concierge was more than willing to recommend dinner establishments & call and get us reservations .  It was a super stay!;4;1;0;1;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2291;4/12/2007;AeYsOpESyCSWHeBNs9l9uw;svViMjhUMPkMjwM923olOg;I have stayed at the PH for about 10 years to attend an annual conference here.  It's always been a good hotel.  Great location,  Rooms are usually fairly nice, though they do seem worn out.  Well, they're working on that now.  RIGHT now.  I flew in last night from California, did not get to bed until very late. This morning at 7:00 (Note: that's 5 a.m. Pacific time, where I am coming from), I wake up to the sounds of hammering and what sounds like a router drill on the other side of the wall at the head of my bed.  No chance of sleep.  I called the front desk.  They were apologetic, but the hotel's full, they can't change my room until later.  So be warned: this hotel's under construction, and if you value SLEEP, you should ask for a room as far from the construction as possible.;2;2;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2292;5/22/2008;UgAUwnyebxEAWZdpJnIs8w;b8vslHjht8t8SmKO0CKC3Q;Nice room on HHoners floor.  Good size, comfortable bed and linens.  Modern clean furniture.   Had a crappy old TV though with a static filled picture.  Also, not a huge fan of the compact florescent lamps they use everywhere - give me one normal light bulb or halogen at the desk.  But I guess they are trying to be 'green' or something.  The food sucked, got a 14$USD cheeseburger that tasted like crap, drinks were pricey too - I think I paid 11 bucks (many times over) for a kettleone + tonic.  Overall it was a nice place though - I am sure I will stay there again, I just won't eat there.;4;1;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2293;6/12/2009;JRz3sweYb6K;FUa2UYW8T8SeXtKdDzx3Bw;I just adore this hotel. It really is gorgeous. I'm a big fan of anything with a great history behind it, and this hotel is chalk full of interesting history. I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there. We booked a room both times using hotwire and were able to score a $78 (for a saturday and sunday, friday for my bf's mom was $73) deal. Good sized room, double beds, and with a window looking at another wing of the hotel. The only thing I didn't really like was that there was no screen in the window, but as I wouldn't go there with kids, it's not that big of a deal. I can't wait until I can stay there myself (though it'll be a while since I live one el stop away).;4;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2294;8/8/2008;T-EFDEWkeZFFTdbOg7QYOA;tWBHvMmO0jkdN2T_sJBkxw;Something always seems to go wrong when I visit Chicago, last time our car got towed at 2am (course our luggage, maps & most $ was in the car ) so we had to wander the streets of Chicago aimlessly... This time the issue was the hotel: Plus 1 star: location Plus 1 star: gorgeous lobby, historical hotel Minus 1 star- for PAPER THIN WALLS Minus 1 star- for being woken by maid each morning Minus 1 star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working & not being helpful to him in any way. I have travelled throughout the US, Europe & Asia and I don't remember any hotel, motel, or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least 11am.  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help. FRI:    9:23am Maid service next door (to those that flew in late & are on CA time that felt like 7:23am about 5 hours BEFORE I had planned to wake).   We're not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum, we're talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together ... that's how thin the walls were. I crawled out of bed & put a "do not disturb" sign up.  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someone's rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning  -- I'd have to say she didn't read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US. Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex. SAT:  Maid service comes through at 8:30am! (which, to someone on PST felt like 6:30am wakeup, esp. after being at a wedding reception until midnight the night before!). SUN.   3:14am woken by screaming fight next door (apparently some jerk ditched his GF).   7:00am woken up by someone in the room on the other side decided it was a good time to SING. 8:30-9:30am Maid knocking on neighbouring doors woke us up later that morning (we'd finally learned to put the do not disturb (or polish our door!) sign up at night). Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago.  Get a call from my BF.  His card won't work on the room. He went to the front desk & since his name wasn't on the reservation they wouldn't give him a new card (Fair enough, appreciate their not giving one to just anyone). What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him. I mean he did have a hotel card, he knew the name of the person in the room, he knew the room #, he could describe the room & our luggage, offered to give them the credit card # the room was charged too - he wasn't just coming in randomly & fishing for info. They told him having me call & verify him would NOT be enough to let him in. He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didn't work.  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work (accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room # & name associated with the card)?.  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didn't work and that his belongings were really in the room. So he called me upset that he wasn't allowed in our room, he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least 4 hours and was at least an hour away. I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in - but it definitely soured our afternoon. Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived & cranky about the above instances : The front of the building is under construction (which is a shame, would've liked to see it).  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address, they gave me the street that had no entrance, instead of the street that had a working entrance). And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport (not knowing there were separate train/non-train lines), so instead of giving us the stop 15 feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport - I was told to get out at a stop about 5 blocks away... still, deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line, probably wants the closest Orange line stop, not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop & then toting luggage to the hotel.;2;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2295;9/8/2010;DSOcoPaLpcK2D8Vt3H5C0g;ZRQWFkI7ga_hbG8i5il83Q;stayed five nights here for a conference last summer.  this was the chosen conference hotel so this was where we stayed.   what i loved: the hotel is gorgeous.  the lobby &amp:ballrooms speak to an era of opulent charm.  i think i gave myself a stiff neck because i couldn't help looking up at the beautiful architecture. the doormen &amp:bellmen are super duper friendly and helpful.   it is located in the middle of everything.  there is so much to see and do and it's all a nice, leisurely walk or cab ride away. shopping!  there are several stores lining the block of the hotel, and even more a little ways down if you don't mind the walk. what i didn't like: while the hotel didn't lack for elevators to get you to your room, if you had other people in your party who were staying on a different floor, there was a big chance you had to hop onto a different elevator from the one servicing your floor to access their room. cell phone reception in some of the rooms sucks.  especially if you have at&ampt.  i thought i'd be fine with my iphone as my internet connection, but i couldn't get a signal in my room.  if i walked down the hall towards the elevators i got full bars.  but that's not convenient when it's  2 am and you want to make a phone call home. other reviewers are not kidding when they say the walls are paper thin.  you can hear full on conversations from people walking down the halls and in adjacent rooms.  luckily, no one was staying in the room next to me. it's almost like a lottery on what size room you will get.  i booked all the rooms for our staff (single occupancy king beds) and some people got large rooms, some got closet sized spaces.  my room was fine since i was the only one staying in it, and i actually had a large bathroom compared to other co-workers rooms.  the reason was my room was renovated for ADA accessibility, so i had a wider door and railings in the restroom, a lower closet rod, and a second peephole at belly-button height.  good for accommodating someone in a wheelchair or a little person.  not so good when you're an average height person and you need to hang some long dresses. for the number of rooms the hotel boasts (over 1,000) and it's ability to accommodate conference crowds), i wasn't too pleased with the concierge/housekeeping accessibility.  i called each at least three times during my stay and was left each time with an endlessly ringing phone. hotel amenities are not free?!  it costs extra to use the hotel pool and the gym?!  now that is an extreme rip-off, expecially when lots of folks are paying a couple hundred bucks per night's stay.  even when i asked  for an extended check-out from 11 AM to 12:30 PM, i was told it would be a $25 charge. overall, it did it's job in providing a safe, comfortable place to stay while in chicago.  i would stay here again, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice of places to stay.;3;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The wired Internet is $20 a day, which should be free. and wireless requires a $200 deposit. the place is crap. if Hilton is meant for business travelers the least the could provide is free Internet and wi-fi. when i went to get ice the machine was broken and the elevators were malfunctioning. if you want to pay a lot for a garbage hotel, this is the place.;2;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Wall paper is coming off walls...considering this is four stars that's a complete shame, illnois must have a different star system than California cause a 2-3 star holiday inn express in California would put this hotel to shame...people giving good reviews must be booking some $1000 suites or working for the hotel to write reviews, if you book regular rooms you'll regret it...spend 15-20 bucks more and get a better hotel like W, Sheraton, or kimpton...This is the second Hilton I'm staying at and both were messes, so bad that I'm writing the review while this ac doesn't let me sleep...hope this review helps ...;1;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2303;6/20/2011;nFT6lfmUpxhYdbBnCNt2rg;te6VTOgPDNmr-43a8O7WiA;I interviewed the general manager at the Palmer House. His friendliness and the friendliness of all staff that I encountered is why I'm writing this review. I haven't stayed at the Palmer House yet, but it is now on my shortlist for my wedding accommodation. Chicagoans...well, we love our city... and mention of the Palmer House gives us little sentimental heart tingles b/c of its deep Chicago historic ties. The newly renovated floors have stunning carpeting (deep brown with brightly colored, modern swirls of peacock aesthetic) with black/white photos of classic stars (Sinatra, Clark Gable, probably Ella Fitzgerald, etc.). Check out the 8th floor! And the furniture! Stunning vintage pieces! Bright greens, blues, etc. straight out of glamorous history! Beautifully photogenic! I'm usually the biggest fan of hotels like The W, The Wit, etc. and I so dig this hotel, b/c I think it fits right into that category without selling out its history.;5;0;0;0;2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
2304;7/31/2012;NDd;54OZX0KOjfAsdRn-b1eqwQ;Hotel Felix has managed to make a small hotel room stylish. My room was only slightly larger than the queen bed in it, but by using creative lighting and utilitarian design, it felt comfortable and hip as opposed to claustrophobic. The hotel front desk attendants were a bit stand offish, and they ended up screwing up the bill a bit, but all in all it was a very pleasant stay. We booked on Priceline, so the price wasn't bad, but the list price of booking through the hotel is a little steep for the space and amenities. If you can get a deal and want a trendy hotel experience, I recommend giving it a try.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

2307;8/26/2012;GdMImdnQta4l3AkQILj2HA;oq6T6FcKl0TA9LV_970_8Q;Traveling through Chicago for business, they booked a coworker and I a room at Hotel Felix for the night.   When we arrived, valet came to greet us and parked the car (for $44).  The hotel staff was prompt, but seemed slightly less then friendly, more like pleasantly bothered?  You can tell the building is very old, which is why the rooms are probably so small - two double beds practically took up the entire room - it was pretty cozy...I think it would be better if you stayed here on a romantic occasion with one queen or king.  Nice amenities, very clean.  If you are looking for somewhere upscale to stay that isn't in the heart of downtown, this is a great option (Not too far from Wrigley Field either).;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2308;6/16/2012;Safx6qo48e7r6HtFk4e1Ew;Egu4qSFR56EhGuTHZTaVjA;I had Hotel Felix on my radar for a while since it was the first LEED Silver certified hotel in Chicago... or something like that. At first I was a little taken aback with regard to the size and configuration of the rooms, but then I remembered it was just remodeled not built new so it's not really set up for some of what I'd call more 'modern-sized americans.' My issues with the room through were three-fold. First, the air filter hadn't been changed in a while, so it was dirty and would bang back down onto the ceiling after the unit shut off. Easily fixed. Second, the apparent lack of storage. Yes there was a tiny closet, but where do I put all of the other crap I had with me for a week long stay? Then I discovered the dresser drawer hidden below the bed (I had a king room). Neato! Third, and this was the one issue I couldn't correct, the lighting. Argh. It was so 'energy-efficient' that it was nonexistent in certain parts of the room... like on the desk! Not cool when you're here for a work trip. And yeah there are LED task lights on the desktop but it didn't improve the situation any... so I ended up doing most of my work on the bed itself - though not without banging my knees on the wood sideboard a couple of times. I didn't spend a bunch of time in the room, but who wants to do that anyway when you're in another city? Other than those qualms, I really liked Felix, and the price we got through Priceline ($99/night, I think) made it much more manageable. I really enjoyed the location, within easy walking distance from some awesome restaurants, public transit, and whole foods, and just a generally relaxed vibe with nice staff. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll definitely stay here again.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2309;4/29/2012;FbbP2LPXY4zYeLGnIM8OZQ;jQYIE9bjrh9EP-B5FXpqPw;Here is a rare, 5FF non-food review on our 3-day, 2-night stay, someplace near every touristy shindigs in Chicago. I booked this 15% off, transient deal via http://hotels.com at about $99 per day for Easter weekend.  I was warned that bringing a car to Chicago requires lots of spare change, where Felix's nearest self-parking structure (at Clark St & Huron) costs $30 for 24 hours, & $44 for valet, & word-of-mouth free if a hybrid is driven.  DL & I decided to park our non-hybrid rental car, lodge at the 5th floor, and end up with a paid-what-we-got, eco-friendly, & elegantly modern & "minimalist" weekend... First I want to point out some advantages.  If you are pro-green, OR you--and a "friend"--don't mind a SMALL (albeit forewarned), tight yet warm space *_*, Felix welcomes you to this.  They carried H2O+ bath-&-body travel products.  We had a safe & booked a queen sized bed, which had clean & medium-firm cushioning that we fell asleep easily.  Thank goodness no other room noises were audible.  FREE (unsecured) wifi is my over-the-top priority, which was why I thought this hotel convinced me enough for this amenity. This could be a con to some individuals, but the wall-supported LCD TV had mediocre screen quality, & the cable channel selection wasn't that numerous: no Disney Channel or Food Network.  Though they did have Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, TBS, ESPN, etc. The disadvantages are things that require a high tolerance of change.  What do I mean by that?  One, we rested on 4 perfectly squared pillows, rather than the quintessential rectangular-ish "clouds."  Two, our get-what-we-paid-for deal came with a view of shanty buildings on the Erie [Street] side... Three--and personally the most important factor--was our bathroom.  I didn't mind the stand-only, curtained shower or the open-faced cabinet hovered above the toilet.  However, what felt awkward & quite frustrating were our atypically rectangular designed sink & our towel hanger.  Perhaps this minimalist approach would be a sink, shaped like a massive appetizer platter, that realistically one person can comfortably & conveniently set his/her "minimalist" toiletries on the available space?!  And perhaps this methodology encourages the showered, soaked guest to walk to the opposite side of the shower just to snatch that thick, not-so-soft white towel?! Oh, almost forgot number four: sleeping surely was a breeze, UNLESS one religiously needs to use a noisy A/C.  Yes: sounds like Felix is dead serious when it comes to being eco-friendly. One last advantage was quick & to-the-point service without rushing us.  Specifically, they informed us that our 2 hotel cards were required as our "key" to use the elevator after 9pm.  For our very first trip to Chicago I conclude that my arrangement with Hotel Felix was not too shabby, yet it would be a Plan B or Plan C decision for the average tourist who has minimal essentials & can leave a little extra room for "souvenirs.";3;42;44;40;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2310;1/14/2012;JdFdz;3P27t_P_JEdMIeej2toNjw;Hotel Felix differentiates itself on style. A self-professed "eco-hostel," the zen interior isn't limited to the spa - it's everywhere. In the lobby, there's a pool of water and a stack of logs (along with the requisite modern furniture). The rooms are also styled in a clean, almost Japanese style. Overall, very stylish. It's in a great spot, too. The hotel is close to Gold Coast shopping, River North galleries, and - should you choose - the tourist traps near Lasalle and Ontario. But, while Felix managed to differentiate itself through style, it still hasn't distinguished itself in service. In fact, service is pretty poor. Whether it's the nonchalant staff at the front desk or the ambivalent cleaning staff, customer service could use some help here.  Upon arrival, the hotel lost (and then found, without apology) my reservation through http://hotels.com. Upon entering my room, a dirty towel and used soap remained in the shower. I checked in at 6 PM, giving the cleaning staff plenty of time to tidy up. The room is also pretty small and the oversize furniture doesn't help the situation. The saving graces are there, though. First, there's price. For the location, the price is unbeatable. My total bill was still only in the double, not triple, digits. The business center and gym are convenient and well-equipped. The restaurant - Elate - is first-rate. The bar's not too shabby, either. But, the question remains: what's the point of a few perks when you drop the ball on what you're supposed to do best: serve the guests?;3;4;1;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2311;12/19/2011;gCgIiQzUgwmGTN33yUeqWA;Sf2foJo2qBAGHQRTimVFSw;The pros:  Very good location to get nearly anywhere via CTA or walking. Free WiFi throughout the hotel... nice touch. Staff, down to a single person, were all fantastic.  Every single one. The bed was very comfortable, the linens were nice. The cons: Quite possibly the smallest hotel room I have every stayed in.  The bed was practically shoehorned into the room.  No place to store luggage if it's bigger than a carry-on.;3;3;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2312;7/5/2012;rMjr7mUPX9Ujn16HBUqQIQ;zAddDr8fzyTV-YB2wSoWTA;First off, I really like smaller, unique little hotels as opposed to giant chains as a general rule so Hotel Felix definitely fit the bill. The biggest plus for me with this one was the location. During my stay, I pretty much walked everywhere and only needed to take a cab once because it was late. The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  And the bed...ah the bed. The bed gave me the best sleep ever! Ordered breakfast as well a couple of times and it good both times but really big servings (I underestimated so I ended up with more food that I can eat. Ooops.)   The room itself was super small but for one person, I didn't think that it was a problem at all. The bathroom was teeny tiny as well but hey, I wasn't going to go be doing any jumping jacks in there anytime soon. I would have rated it higher except for the fact that the toilet overflowed with a lot of stuff on my last day. A tad gross even for someone like me with a strong constitution. I did notify them right away but I was on my way out already so I am not sure if they fixed immediately. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I wouldn't mind staying there again.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Is Hotel Felix a 4-star hotel?  Perhaps a stretch. Having said this, however, I've bid on and won other 4-star hotels on Priceline in the past, and Hotel Felix was nicer than many of the other 4-star rated hotels I've reserved. This is a decent little hotel.  Modern, clean, with friendly staff, and a decent location.  No, it's not on the Magnificent Mile, and I don't like that priceline groups River North & Mag Mile together, increasing the odds you'll end up in River North over Michigan Ave with a low bid offer, but hey, that's the risk you take, and its River North location is great for proximity to family tourist destinations such as Rainforest Cafe, Ed Debevic's, Hard Rock Cafe, etc. Free Wifi was a bonus, rooms, though small, were quite nice.  Ordered room service for dinner one night, and the food, especially the gourmet burger, was absolutely delicious.  I know the hotel is small, but with a family, the only other missing piece was a pool, but hey, you can't have everything, especially for the price. Are there other better choices?  Sure.  Would I recommend Hotel Felix to anyone asking?  Absolutely.;4;1;1;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

2317;2/2/2011;KHlbjFBAJ0SOJJJaKe-;wUhsofLMikud2eJlQNM9fA;The Hotel Felix rates comfortably between a Kimpton Hotel and the W. The single rooms are nicely appointed, but do not include a refrigerator, which I needed during Snowapocalypse 2011. Highlights: - The elevators are fast, which is atypical for a boutique hotel - The room service is quick and courteous - The rooms look like the inside of a West Elm store - The water pressure is very good - Each room has plenty of towels - There is a safe in the room - The fitness center has treadmills, elliptical machines and free weight dumbbells - The toiletries are a nice quality and plentiful - There is a bar and good restaurant, Elate, on the first floor My only complaint is that the single room is very small. The bedroom area is 12' x 12' and fits a bed and 1 - 2 moderately-sized humans. There is also a small desk that holds a laptop and not much else. That said, the spacious shower balances out the lack of square footage in the bedroom area. Net-net, I'd recommend and stay at the Hotel Felix anytime.;4;3;2;1;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

My friends Sage J. and Andy just moved here and Andy  booked us a hotel at hotel Felix.   The rooms are small which is typical for big cities. It's slightly smaller than the Club Quarters in San Francisco. However the place is clean, the employees are friendly and it's located in a prime location. I love that it's within walking distance to my favorite grocery store "Whole Foods". This is a really special hotel that caters to the business traveler and the young & hip. (but not the douchey trendy hipster kind)  Lots of bars and shopping nearby. Internet is free, but it's very slow. There is no coffee maker and no luggage rack in the room,  but overall a good experience.;4;4;5;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2320;8/30/2010;ZklGbijT5paOCLKz6XkBbw;ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ;If you're a fan of paying $200 a night for rooms that are the size of a shoebox that are barely even big enough to house a queen sized bed (a room so tiny you think that THEY MUST have made some kind of mistake as your first impression upon walking in), invasive and extremely unflattering fluorescent lighting that shines downwards right over the bed and into your eyes straight just as if you were getting interrogated about where you were the night of August 8th, 2010, loud knocking from maids starting at 7 am and complete disregard for what a Do Not Disturb sign actually means, then you will LOVE this place. ME, not so much! There would be better noise proofing if I had set up a cardboard box underneath a freeway overpass and I'd probably have been more comfortable too. Speaking of cardboard, that's what their sheets felt like... scratchy and cheap. Wow! I'm giving this place some awards I tell ya! Home of the noisiest a/c that can't make up it's mind about whether it's going to blow cold or hot air so it alternates between the two and the shallowest sink I've ever seen in my life with absolutely zero counter space. Don't even start me on the water pressure or lack thereof in the shower and the toilets that don't flush, even considering they are supposed to be green. Oh that's right, this place is supposed to be "eco-friendly"! So when you have to take twice as long in the shower to wash the soap away because no water comes out of the faucet and you're flushing the toilets at least three times instead of only once, how exactly is that saving any more water? Just curious. It's apparent this hotel is only trying to be "eco" so that they can save money on their end. Also Yelpers please take note, internet is slow as hell here, there is no bathtub, no mini-bar, and no reason that I could ever justify spending this kind of money (close to $200) to stay in a Holiday Inn/Motel 6 using an "eco chic" marketing angle in attempts to pass themselves off as a 4 star hotel. I hightailed it out of there after the first night and I made sure I picked a gas guzzling cab, cranked the a/c, and put all the windows down just to even my carbon footprint score a bit. I should have immediately gone to buy some aerosol hairspray and deodorant and left the lights and TV on 24/7 at my next hotel the whole rest of my vacation in order to make up for all the hardships I had to put up with after staying at that place. Hahaha! Seriously though, good riddance to Hotel Felix! As mentioned in the other reviews, the cool doorman was the best thing about this place but he's way too good for this craphole!;2;28;22;28;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2321;4/17/2009;2cqUnnaUMR6vBhIKSpHVOA;7NV6kcM2Mq5qY1drWD7LIg;*** woo-hoo, back in Chicago for one last vacation nite. *** so i decided to check out this spot since the location is cool (River North), price was right ($110/nt) and it's new (opened 3wks ago) ... besides i generally prefer boutique-style hotels. i think this place is perfect for those who wanna go clubbing. this area is club central.  there are about a dozen clubs within walking distance.  i'm thinking of selling off my kid as i'm typing this so i can go out tonite ... haha, j/k ... i think i will keep him, lol. anyways, Hotel Felix is charming.   it's only 12 stories high and the rooms are the size of a shoebox, but it's perfect to rest your head - free wifi, continental breakfast comp'd, fitness ctr and bar is tight. barring any unforeseen events, i'd definitely ret'n for a solo stay. *** overnite valet is $42 but plenty of street prkg.  got quarters? ***;3;9;7;4;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2322;8/25/2009;lVV3kd22i;jMzmali07h-XH1YpiiM3AA;What does a Do Not Disturb sign on a hotel room door mean to you? To me, it means one of two things: 1. Do not disturb. 2. I don't want my room serviced. Evidently, it does not mean those things to the housekeepers at Hotel Felix. We had several rather unpleasant altercations with the housekeepers at Hotel Felix during our recent trip to Chicago. On our first day, we put the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and they did not come in, only leaving a message on our machine that if we needed new towels just to let them know. On our second day, we kept the sign on our door. Even though it was there and still there when we returned later that afternoon, we found that our room had been serviced. The next morning, the sign was still on the door. Around 7am, my mom and I both awoke to someone trying to get into our room. We sat up and found that housekeeping wanted to service our room...AT SEVEN AM. WTF? You would think that they would catch our drift having that sign on there all the time - we don't want to be disturbed and we don't to have our room serviced. It's a "green" hotel right? Why do they want to get in our room so bad? Well, the next morning after that at NINE AM, I answered a knock at the door: Housekeeper: "I see this sign on your door. Do you want service?" Me: "No service. Also, do not disturb." Housekeeper: "I see the sign, are you sure you don't want service." Me: "I don't want service and I don't want to be disturbed. That is why I put the sign on the door." Housekeeper: "Are you sure?" Me: "Yes". Closes door. Finally, they left us alone for the last two days that we were there. It seems strange that I don't want housekeeping, but I don't want to waste resources and I don't like people I don't know touching my stuff. On the day that we were checking out, we were standing in front of the elevators on our floor about to go down to the main desk. A housekeeper stepped out of a room right next to us and asks if we were in room 1107. We responded yes and she rushed right down to our room right away. We hadn't even left for 2 minutes and she already wanted to get down there. Strange. We also witnessed one of the housekeepers vacuuming in the lobby area during the hotel's happy hour, with everyone standing around looking in shock. I dunno what was up, but they have some crazy housekeepers there. The rooms are small and the air conditioners turn on about every 10 minutes, making the rooms frigid. The gym is okay, but closes at 9pm, which is rather early. There are no glasses in the room, which is strange because there is an ice bucket. Isn't it a 4 star hotel? I would expect many more amenities that what we received. Also, they lost our reservations. So we arrived, tired and in a city we had never been to haggling with the concierge for 45 minutes before we finally got our room.;2;5;3;4;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2323;4/1/2009;PH;Y2iLLq02CUVfKHsowQ4wXw;Even though my stay at the Hotel Felix wasn't perfect, I'm still giving it five stars because I know they just had a few brand-new-hotel-kinks to work out. All in all, this place is fantastic - perfect location, close to everything, super-cool ambiance (modern and cozy), really comfortable beds, huge showers, friendly staff and good service and a big eco-friendly emphasis. Three bummers - the restaurant/bar wasn't open yet, the TV movie and check out system didn't work, and the front desk wasn't staffed on a Monday morning to call for check out. But...I'm confident these will all be remedied shortly and when they are, this will be my new favorite hotel in Chicago. Oh...and it was CHEAP! I think my grand total for one night was about $120 INCLUDING $42 valet. Totally worth it.;5;3;2;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2324;7/8/2009;UP6r3ymW;YhIYQRzr6zpNMWAYhr23ZQ;I absolutely loved my stay at Hotel Felix.  I booked a King room the weekend of June 20th.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  It seemed like 4-star service at a 3-star price.  The room was very comfortable:the mattress and pillows were cushy to my taste.  I loved seeing the Chicago skyline from my window. I enjoyed a quick workout in the small-ish but clean fitness center.  Although it was small, it didn't feel claustrophobic.  The windows helped. I also have to compliment the spa.  Again, it was very small, but I actually prefer the coziness.  The massage therapist gave me one of the best I've had.  At $85, it was well worth it.  I ate dinner after the massage, and pretty much slipped into food coma after that.  Luckily I had a comfy bed, and a big old TV with movie rentals.  I totally girled out and rented a chick flick.  What better way to spend some days off?   The location is great to walk to various places downtown, but I can't really recommend hanging out downtown.  There are much better places to spend your time and money.  Fortunately there are plenty of train lines around. I highly recommend a stay at the Felix.  Although I booked a great rate on Hotwire, I'd be willing to pay the regular rate, which isn't bad at all.;5;2;1;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2325;9/2/2009;KyJy2ObU5FzNmCSZ8SmZCA;rfGeOOIHw0wcX3ibAzTqTA;There is a reason why I like boutique hotels.  First, it's small and that usually means great customer service.  Second, the products are usually better.  Third, I like knowing that I'm in an unique hotel.  Which is exactly my reaction from my recent stay at Hotel Felix.  Great customer service from check-in to check-out.  The room was smaller than I anticipated but that didn't mean I didn't LOVE it.  I adored it!  A bit pricier than I would have preferred but it was so wonderfully located in downtown Chicago I just couldn't complain. I highly recommend!;5;2;2;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2326;12/25/2009;zLBq0d7y8IY47Dc2PfW9Xg;7uS7VV9ld3CcScM8CaT0bQ;Stayed here for one night via http://Priceline.com for $59.  For the money, it was obviously a good deal.  The doormen are very polite and on the spot.  Bar is a cozy little place to escape the city on a cold night.  Decor has a very modern/upscale feel to it and is nicely done.  Front desk clerk was very helpful as well. The rooms, while nicely appointed, are a little on the small side.  The rooms come with flat screens, free wifi and a work desk.  Bed was very comfortable.  Outside noise from the hallways entered the room pretty easily, and my room was at the end of the hallway.  Can't imagine what staying across from the elevator sounds like. Showers are awesome, but the sink is very small with barely enough room to fit your hands under the faucet to wash them.  Also, there is no room around the sink to keep any of your stuff on. They have a spa, and I tried to set up a massage.  Was told they had 3 appointment for the next day in the late morning/noon area.  Got off the phone with them, called the front desk to arrange late checkout, called right back and supposedly they were all booked.  Talking about a 2 minute window here.  I don't think it was even physically possible to field that many calls that quickly.  Don't call yourself a full service spa if you can't fit in one massage in an 18 hour window. Overall, nice place that I wouldn't have a problem staying at again.;3;2;2;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2327;12/14/2009;od7lkTF92pZipUP2LQkZ7g;q-UbsVvY9BIWOe_J1mozMA;Overall I was pleased with my stay at the Felix. The staff was very helpful, great bartender (very cute too), good location, and contemporary decor. The beds were very comfortable and dressed with quality linens. My complaints would be tiny and I do mean TINY rooms. In fact everything in the Felix was tiny. Tiny elevators, hallways, bar, and lobby.  Complaint #2 there is no concierge. I'm a girl who makes the concierge my best friend so not having one was a big deal for me. However, the front desk people were helpful in making restaurant recommendations and the doorman gave  decent directions. Overall, it fell short of what I would consider a boutique hotel, but for the price I would stay there again!;4;2;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2328;6/9/2010;P0NXA0KFM0D34vky7qrpJQ;XBNtqhc72X57VK8GLNbsGg;Stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago.  Chose it because of the location, the price, and the fact that you can valet park your hybrid FOR FREE!  Yeah that last point kind of sold me on it. As for the rooms, yes they are small, but whatever.  They are clean, seem kind of hip, and the bed is totally freakin' amazing.  Like seriously the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.  And I guess the blackout curtains would have been nice if I didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn every morning I was in Chicago for a conference... I personally did not have a problem with the sink but I can see how people might, and the shower is wonderful.  Not to mention the H20 brand toiletries, a local Chicago brand, nice touch! On to the service.  The doormen are so nice.  So nice in fact when I saw one of them on the street a few blocks from the Hotel he said hello and wished me a wonderful day.  The front desk staff are another story.  They are baffled by what I would consider normal touristy questions such as "how do I get to this neighborhood" etc.  They actually gave us the wrong information.  Good thing we didn't listen to them. Also, the noise level may bother some.  You can hear a lot.  You can hear the elevator ding.  You can hear the shower next door.  You get the picture. But yeah, stay here because of the location, price, FREE parking (if you drive a hybrid), and the eco-consciousness factor.  Ignore bitchy staff.;4;1;1;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2329;2/6/2012;rlwSwS95e1q3txanm0Lonw;ruxIejxlXr9oz4WWIyjGug;I booked this hotel through Priceline and got a very, very good price.  When reading the reviews I was a little concerned about the size of the rooms.  Much to my surprise, the room I received was very adequate.  I have been in several other river north hotels and was familiar with small rooms.  This room had a full bath.  I was told it was only one of ten in the hotel (out of 120 rooms).  My experience was great.  The rooms were very clean.  The location is great (only 3/4 blocks from Michigan Ave).  The service was great as well.  I parked across the street and saved about $30 over the two nights we were there.  I would highly recommend this hotel.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2330;3/6/2012;QjGj0kqLjBdo8OVpyDp4lQ;ef2x0pAGvT1_8fl4vi4Ovw;DO NOT STAY HERE! Last weekend we traveled to Chicago for celebrating a bachelorette's party. We booked this hotel via Priceline's name your own price. Upon our arrival, we were notified that we were only able to stay in two rooms with a single queen size bed in each room. Okay, we have EIGHT girls in our group. We were unable to change the room------In an extremely rude and awful manner, the front desk receptionist insisted that it was the rule because we booked via Priceline and they were all sold out that night. Okay. We asked for adding an extra bed. They said they did not have any rolled bed option. Fine. No apology at all and the receptionist spoke with us with a poker face and as if we owe her 100000000 bucks. That night , we then asked for some extra blankets and pillows for making our own "bed" on the floor. Yes, three of us had to sleep on the hard floor. The other three of us had to squeeze on the queen size bed in an uncomfortable way. The front desk gave us a couple (6) thin blankets  and then said "we were out of blankets".  The service man delivering the blankets was in an absolutely bad manner too. In the end we were offered another two thin bed sheets.......... It was chilled last weekend in Chicago.  What's more, the bathtub clotted in one of our rooms and the water drained super slow................  The technician responded and came for help very quickly (and very courteous). But he said it was probably due to a lid of the shampoo bottle......so he was not able to get it fixed. The second day, we were in hope of having some other guests from larger room checked out so that we would be able to switch room.  We called the front desk at 7:00 AM in the morning (cuz they told us to do so..............) and the receptionist said we should be able to get "TWO" larger rooms and he told us to call back before we headed out (so that they could get ready). We called the receptionist around 10:30ish AM and he told us to pack our luggage and drag our luggage to the lobby for moving to our "TWO" new rooms. When we arrived at the lobby, the receptionist said "you were only able to get one larger room" . OKAY, we eight gals all packed and dragged our luggage to the lobby and now you told us we got only one room changed???? The receptionist (a different one from the first day) was once again very rude and very impatient from the very first beginning. He even said "DID YOU GET IT?" This is totally unacceptable. Finally they gave us a new larger room (with two queen size beds)  and a new smaller room with one queen size bed.   We did not change hotel because we all traveled for a long time and very tired and did not want to pay 80ish bucks still to Priceline if we cancelled the reservation. The rooms were very small. If you travel alone, I think it totally works. However, never stay here in groups. The beds were with very hard and sharp borders. With the very limited space, you bump into those sharp borders easily when moving in the room. Three of us got bruises because of this. The AC system was pretty loud in the room and the outlet was in a strange orientation. The second night the heat air blew directly on my face all night long. Are you sure this is a 4-star hotel given the poor quality of service and all of the above?   The bellmen were courteous though and we were greeted nicely (only by the bellmen). IMHO, this hotel has serious management problems.;1;3;1;1;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2331;6/3/2010;T6wwC2d81W8KldE59ZAdTA;Ez0gRasGbvxNmBd2e9VRMQ;The bellhops and doorman are super helpful, the place is immaculately clean, smooth, and inviting.  It's a green hotel so I like that social consciousness as well. Lets start with the front desk service.  It needs some serious help in the 'service' department.  Dismissive comments and rolling your eyes doesn't help me when I ask you simple questions like 'Can you direct me to the nearest train stop?' 'Can you tell me how to get to Ukranian Village?"  I apologize, I am not a native of Chicago and yes - I'm a noob.  Thankfully I have an iphone and with an extra 5 minutes of research, yeah I can figure it out I guess - but thoughtI'd leverage the 'service'.    After I learned that lesson..  all was well.. on to the room. The room is super clean, nice, and the bed is amazing.  I mean really comfortable.  The blinds are bad ass.. no light is getting through them. It can be turned into a cave at 2pm with no light getting in.  Drawbacks - sound.  I can hear people coughing in their rooms, brushing their teeth, running the shower, slamming their doors.  The room I had was at the end of the hall way - Yet I could still hear the 'elevator ding' (located in the middle of the hall).   Thankfully I can overcome secondary sounds.. others may not. Overall I'd stay here again - I liked it.  If you have the extra cash, check out the spa - its an AVEDA spa on the 2nd floor.;4;1;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2332;11/19/2010;Aj6x3sYvzf4YaNOsJVDJOQ;_1-vheNMAWoAeBdykuZYZA;I was so excited about staying at this cute little hotel, and it did not (really) disappoint. Service: was excellent throughout. The staff was no nice and helpful in directing me to my nearest Starbucks etc. Decor: lobby was gorgeous and adorable. I loved the fire and the things hanging from the ceiling. The little bar/coffee bar is a cute intimate touch. Rooms: were very cute. They're really small, but for one person on a business trip, it was great. There were nice little touches that you don't see in other hotels. Only one tiny window in each room though. Location--EXCELLENT. Other: I hate elevators and the elevators in the hotel were a little bit sketchy. I was afraid they would get stuck. Overall: Love that its LEED certified, love the decor, love the location. Get new elevators and its 5 stars! That said, I'd stay here again!;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2333;11/14/2010;PvZ2ymjP6dSyHf6PIoku6w;OK4C8FONOju2D3RSBacB0Q;Central to any place you might want to walk to in Chicago, the Felix is a great base-camp for any adventures you're planning to have. It is certified Silver LEED status, which also makes you feel good that about Felix's commitment to the environment. The rooms are small, but well designed. The only lacking component is a spacious closet, so if I had stayed for a week or longer, I would have grown tired not having enough space to hang clothes. On the other hand, the bed is the most comfortable one I have ever slept in at a hotel and the shower is well designed and doesn't take forever to heat up. The bar is a great place to relax, though they could bump up their selection some - the night I went down to relax they only had 3 beer offerings. Another big plus - Absolutely free internet service, which was fast. Also a plus, no annoying login process each time you connect! Next time I head to Chicago, I'm calling Felix.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2334;9/8/2009;Z45UEplo;DPgDtsK0Sz2Wti7ER-QFoA;Wow.  We booked the Hotel Felix for our wedding night.  But after reading some pretty discouraging reviews here and there I gave them a call to discuss my concerns - I live in Chicago so the idea of dropping several hundred dollars for a bad experience when I could just sleep at my house is super unpalatable.   So, I called.  And the woman I spoke with was incredibly aggressive and rude.  She basically barked at me that what I had heard was an absolute lie and that in one particular situation where hotel staff opened the door to an occupied guestroom - that it was the guests fault.  And I quote "If you are going to be doing that in your room you should observe the hotels policies and hang a do not disturb sign on your door".  Are you kidding me? Insane.  This place needs to get it together.  I cannot believe that someone would respond to a guests concerns like that.  Totally mishandled.  Taking my business elsewhere!;1;1;0;1;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2335;8/24/2010;d4jM4os0t4CNy1q2z7otGw;NLyYL23oE882cijFj7iWsw;Stayed here on my mini-vacay with my OG BFF.  Found a really good deal on Expedia and it only cost $200/each from a Thursday to a Sunday. Situated on the corner of W Huron and N Clarke St, the hotel is in a pretty good location.  A block or 2 away from Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe and the BIGGEST double-decker McDonald's (open 24/7 - and I'm not just talking drive-thru) I have ever seen in my entire life!!!  It's several walking blocks away from the Magnificent mile, and other tourist attractions, but completely walkable if you have the right pair of shoes.   Staff are extremely friendly and professional, the hotel lobby is small, but classy and the amenities are nice (no pool though).  As with any major metropolitan city hotel, the rooms run small so I gave it 3 stars, but on the upside they are kept pristinely clean.  They even provide eco-friendly bottled water in the room, but don't drink it or accidentally lose it behind furniture...they will charge you $2.50/bottle upon checkout.  Next time I'm in town, I'll probably stay here again.  =);3;0;1;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2336;12/13/2011;Ig7jsBGNLcUBuerZeUXDxA;mYt0GyFeHlaqiGXgGMQwNQ;The hotel was decorated very nice and had a comfortable feel. I loved the eco-friendly points of the hotel! I rarely use the products that hotels supply but I loved the brand they give to you (h2o+). The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only gripe would be that the walls are VERY thin. It wasn't an issue for me but just be aware if you plan on staying here!;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2337;11/22/2009;972uMplKKRutS0vynOedfg;ShwO70X2AWTIAvgi9ZL1Ww;I stayed here a few times for business shortly after it opened. It has a nice location, and it's very modern. The staff was friendly. The restaurant wasn't open yet, but the bar was nice. I didn't spend much time there since it was very expensive and I had a lot of work. The rooms were small but nice. Although I haven't been to Tokyo, it's how I picture hotel rooms there based on my expertise from Lost In Translation. I really didn't mind the small space since it was very well designed and decorated. My main complaint would be the bathroom. There's nowhere to put any of your stuff since the sink is a pedestal with no storage. Also, the shower has a curtain that doesn't stop the water from making a good sized puddle on the shower floor. I'm sure the maids love this. I was very pleased with the great staff and nicely appointed rooms, especially at the comparatively low rates for Chicago.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2338;1/24/2010;pyl4rgX10Efr73pC3r5M1w;GjkUj3Ia_c1XLPjjT7-58w;We Pricelined Hotel Felix and got a pretty good deal.  Given what we paid, it was decent.  However, if we had paid the rack rate, it might not have been worth it. The decor is very contemporary and minimalist.  I very much liked it.  The front desk staff was very friendly, but not the most deft at using the computer system.  We had to give them the same credit card three times during our one night stay because apparently it didn't get stored to the account. We got into our room and it was small but very well appointed.  Unfortunately the bathroom was not cleaned.  It was very strange...there was a wet washcloth in there and not the full compliment of toiletries.  The manager and housekeeping staff were very attentive to this and solved it quickly. The bathroom has NO counter space.  The sink it very cool looking but not very functional.  It sits only about three inches below the faucet so you can barely get your hands under it to wash them. The bed linens were nice and the bed was very comfortable. We found their claim that the rooms are "whisper quiet" to be false.  We were awakened several times at night by street noises, noises in the hall, and an alarm from the neighboring room. The TVs are full HD and the free Wifi is a plus. We enjoyed a little getaway within the city, but not sure if we'd stay there again...especially if we had to pay full price.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2339;5/20/2010;UajIcEEbipuqjF5ShhceBg;1DuqdfvQcSEl0bgTLWNneA;It's kind of hard to find reasonable boutique hotels in the city.  Or do I not know where to look?  Got married last Saturday.  Down to the wire, we decided to stay in a hotel the night of rather than schlep back home.  Hotel Felix had been written up in Time Out and the look and location fit what we were looking for.  Made my reservation on Expedia, but called to say it was our honeymoon so we wouldn't get stuck in the musty room by the elevator. The rooms ARE small, but when you have an awesome king size bed with a fluffy down comforter, who cares?  What are people doing with all this extra room?  I was worried about noise because of the tight space, but we didn't hear anyone all night.  Had a drink in the hotel bar, which is always funny, because, well, hotel bar.  Blackout curtain is fantastic.  We stayed in the cave until a couples massage at the spa on the 2nd floor.  Great atmosphere and we were treated very nicely there.  Easy check in and check out.  Only thought it was a little weird no one said anything about it being our honeymoon when we arrived.  Despite that, a good experience.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

2341;3/7/2010;kB4rCThh5gT73r3kNUR7Kw;xdyv0qBpxFoXoup8Lk5KSw;I stayed here back in late October 2009. The rooms are a little small, but they are very clean and comfortable. Perfect for a couple or someone visiting the city alone. The staff was very friendly and they let us check in early, which worked out great! Parking was free if you have a hybrid- we don't, but could have saved a lot of money on parking if we did! There is a small spa in the hotel. We had thought about scheduling massages, but it didn't seem to get much service which concerned us. So, we decided against it. There is also a restaurant that connects to the lobby. We had free breakfast tickets from the hotel. It was overpriced for what it was, and they were short staffed- and service was horrible. I wouldn't pay to eat here, but it was alright for a free meal. Despite the restaurant, spa, and smaller rooms, I would stay here again. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean (newly remodeled) and comfortable! I would definitely recommend it!;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

While many of the reviewers on TripAdvisor were right, yes the rooms are on the small side, however the bathroom was large but lacking much counterspace. The staff was extremely courteous and the hotel offers free wi-fi, which is usually unheard of at a hotel like this. The location isnt the best, its a safe area however you are a few blocks away from Michigan Ave, so if you are expecting to be in the middle of the shopping district you may want to reconsider. However the hotel is only about 3-4 blocks to the Red Line, and about the same distance to Michgan Ave so it is a fairly quick walk.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2344;4/21/2009;mjObT;RmGVwY_BThid58Py7OePEA;We stayed at Hotel Felix just three weeks after it opened and we loved it. We ended up paying $110 a nite (stayed for two nites) which was the cheapest we could find in Chicago. The staff was exceptionally friendly. We already knew the area, so not much assistance was needed finding stuff to do. The rooms and entire hotel have a very modern feel (which we like). The beds were AMAZING. The TV was great and everything was spotless. The only real downside was that some of our TV stations weren't coming in very well, but that's not really a big deal. Free breakfast in the morning and contains exactly what you'd think: thawed pastries, coffee, juice, cereal, bagels, etc. We found street parking very easily. We opted to park in the nearby garage overnight, which was about as expensive as the valet would've been. The downsides were (as stated below) that the bar and restaurant weren't yet open, but no big deal. It's a new hotel and is experiencing growing pains as you'd expect. All-in-all, we'd love to stay there again.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2345;10/10/2011;iw0kINWGe5QGRkWhyS2TPg;MINfmRRYgu9dDcbPUoKM2Q;http://Hotels.com was $134/night.  I called the hotel and asked them what a rate would be and I averaged $108/night.  It always pays to call the hotel directly. The room was small but I really didn't care.  I'm hear for business and a hotel is generally a place to relax and sleep after meetings.  I'm not moving in!  It was very clean, the vibe was young, hip and the front desk service, cleaning staff and guys out front were STELLAR. The young lady who I checked in with, Noemi(spelling?) was very cordial and VERY HOT! I'll be back in Chicago several times over the next 6 months and I plan to stay at Hotel Felix again.  Oh yeah!  FREE WIFI!  That was awesome.  What a great touch.  So many hotels charge from $10 - 30/day which i ridiculous!!  Free wifi is awesome!;5;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2346;6/28/2011;p70ACoWYIEFxKzCFHrp3SQ;HKqE2FH4Gdysl4KmbXI9Ww;This is a lovely hotel! The location was excellent for walking to destinations. I never had more than a $5 cab ride to anywhere, save the airport. There is a Walgreens across the street for the dental floss you forgot to pack and a whole foods across the other way for room snacks or a quick familiar bite. The roomservice/restaurant Elate was very good. I opted for breakfast in bed one day: french omlet (chervil is my new favorite herb), potatoes, toast, fresh squeezed OJ and coffee. It was about $25 for this luxury, but well worth it! The food was large in porportion, delicious, delivered, and you'd pay the same or more if you went out for breakfast anyways. The room was a bit small, but I wasn't planning on doing pilates or a dance routines in it or anything. The beds were beyond comfortable, and between the free wi-fi and TV programming(They even had HBO), floor to ceiling windows with great views and black-out curtains for those lazy hung-over vacation mornings-- I was more than content. There was a room safe, iron w/board, and hair dryer. I would suggest bringing your own hair dryer if you're a "hair" person, a lighter and a fan might dry your hair better than that little sucker did. And they take a ding in my book on the water pressure. It was one of those "tickle" showers. I think it's due to the overall  conservation theme of the place. The provided mini products (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, bar soap, body butter)  from the spa were definately thieving worthy-- I took home all the body butter I could get (they replenish them daily, whether you empty them out or not). The staff was nice--front desk people were a little stuffy, bartender was really sweet and made some fine beverages, but the valet/taxi guys were the best. They were all very knowledgeable in regards to what/where/when to do, just about anything you could come up with while in Chicago and are more than happy to get you a ride there or direct you by foot. They were cheerful and friendly every day, even in the rain.;4;1;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2347;6/28/2011;NpKjiKwsuk-PDdUsaume6A;WdkBHNy3eIWbzZeBuKHSGw;Got a deal on Hautelook for this hotel for my best friend and I who were having a girls weekend in Chicago.  The hotel is cute and the location is great if you want to be near Michigan Ave.  Rooms are on the small side, like other reviewers have said, but they were still fine, not like oh my god I'm staying in a closet. The staff wasn't too attentive to problems: we mentioned twice that the phone in our room didn't work (we had wanted to buzz down for late check out and wake up calls) and nobody ever did anything about it, even though they said they would.  Things we didn't mention that still didn't work were the ipod dock, and the AC system woke me up numerous times throughout the night.  That sucker was LOUD.  Would I pay full price to stay here again?  No, but for the deal I got, it was more than adequate.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2348;2/20/2011;AW5KiZd2NuCYNZescp8kmw;ynB-sMgkQBq_BIR5HQmt-Q;Found a great deal through 'name your own price' on priceline, which definitely made it worth the trip.  Location is close to major roads and transportation, so you can get around the city when you want to go exploring.  The rooms are not huge, but very comfortable (e.g. with the bed linens and the temperature controlled rooms).  The lobby is inviting with the fireplace and water feature.  The is also a common area on the second floor with a television.  They are a green hotel, which people may love or hate--yet it explains the set-up.  It is cute and worth the trip as long as you know what you are expecting.  Went her on a girlfiends get-away with great customer service and cute quote cards on our way out the door to send us on our merry way!;3;0;0;1;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2349;8/19/2011;0o0aCHU46mXRjMfBQtZnoQ;Nfw-p_zoF3stqE0m889zpA;3 1/2 is more fitting. A fine hotel in a good neighborhood. Safe to walk back to if you've had a long night and close enough to the L. Lots of good restaurants in walking distance. Everyone is bitching about the room size but honestly, compared to a lot of other more expensive Chicago hotels, i.e. the Palmer House, the Intercontinental, etc. the rooms were really not that small. The rooms were also modernly decorated,  and the bed is very comfy. You can control the thermostat (in some eco hotels this is an issue). The bathroom is big and the shower(water pressure, SPA toiletries, set up) is good too. One of the things I hate about some upscale/boutique hotels is there is always an absence of drink/ice machines. Maybe they feel the machines are too Motel 6y, but when all you're offering is a $6 hot bottle of water I appreciate a $3 Gatorade from a machine. AND, this is just an assumption, but I think there is a drink/ice machine on every floor. NEGATIVES - A shit view. Just a dumpy looking roof and bricks. Elate's breakfast menu on their website is completely different then what they actually have. It is the same old omelet, $8 side of bacon that most hotels have, thats why you should just hike two blocks to either Eggsperience if its late or Yolk any other time before 3pm. But the staff was great and okayed a late check out and its close to Michigan Ave. if you're into that sort of thing. And if you're not, cabs are easily acquired.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2350;8/28/2009;Q9;T2o0YCTYajodiK8uE4whiw;The Felix. One star and  most of that goes towards the doorman. Can't remember his name but that guy was great. He did everything but tuck me in at night. Checked in with quite possibly the slowwwest front desk staff on this continent. I have checked in to a hotel in Morroco where no one spoke english and it went smoother. We get to the hotel and got up to the room , small room but thats allright , to find out that apparently the carpet was soaked. I found this out when I kicked off my shoes and stepped on to the soaking carpet. Nice. Had to leave to go to work so down to the painfully slow desk I went.  Told the woman working the desk about the carpet and her response was:  "really?" After a moment of awkward silence I asked if perhaps by chance if she wasn't busy could she wrangle me up a new room. Her response was: 'Hmmmm. Let me see." Says she can get me a room later and she'll call me when its ready. Got a call several hours later , the new room is ready we'll move your bags , new keys will be waiting at the desk etc... All is well I think , They made a mistake and now are correcting it. Ah yes. Go back to the Felix and the bags haven't been moved , the keys are not ready and now my key to the slop soaked room from earlier will not work. Back down to the desk not once but twice to get everything rectified. The new desk clerk has no idea what is going on and is moving at a pace that makes the first clerk look like Jesse Owens. I started out giving this three stars but have since moved it to one. If you want to see the best thing going at the Felix just walk by and say hi to the doorman. He's the best in the city in my book. the rest of the place? Not so much;1;2;0;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2351;5/28/2009;zv7GfAxh87GVb8cpJTsuCQ;LdQwm7f0jPWatnH0iKROEA;great little boutique hotel just off the Miracle Mile in Chicago. it's convenient to all manner of downtown public transport options and there are tons of eateries in the area (though not enough small, independent places for my liking...was kinda hard to find a fun+quirky breakfast, but i'd suggest Brett's Kitchen or the Ohio House diner). Hotel Felix *just* opened so the restaurant isn't even up and running and they're ironing out some kinks, but they make up for it with great and personal customer service. some examples: - i noted on our reservation that it was our anniversary and they had a bottle of wine and a hand-written note waiting in our room - when a surprise rainstorm hit on our last day, the front desk scared up an umbrella for us to borrow for the whole day - even though our stay was short, all the doormen remembered us and greeted us warmly and personally each time we returned. ...add to all this that the hotel is extremely eco-friendly (it has silver LEED certification) and affordable and you have a winner.;4;1;1;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2352;1/13/2010;SG5bLCTwyL0qvKGvglxG8Q;bmtNNp1vzcLZ-TyVudQFIw;Hotel Felix is a quaint little hotel with very friendly staff. My girlfriends and I had booked a one night stay for our annual girls christmas extravaganza.There was 4 of us and we came with enough crap for about 10 people.When we pulled up the lovely valet man informed us that we could park across the street for a cheaper rate than valet! I thought that was really nice of him. After that 2 bell boys unloaded all our stuff and sent it up to our room where he insisted on unloading everything himself. A long story short we had many a request that night and all were taken care of promptly. The only issue we had the whole time was the lack of a lamp in the room so it was a little dark, other then that it was a great stay!;5;2;1;2;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2353;4/26/2011;R6eQpHaVXy-mrvZOBR0epg;JirzxZSI08bK-m_ixMImxw;I stayed here over a year ago and I should have known better.  I read reviews from it but didn't heed any warnings.  They were complaining about the carpet being wet.  So when I was going through the reviews before booking this hotel I figured, there is no way they would have this same problem, since the review I read was written a year prior to me checking into this dump.  Sure enough when I check in, they still couldn't fix this problem.  That was complaint #1.  Complaint #2, their bed fills up the whole room.  I rate this place pricey because no matter what kind of bargain you may find online, it's not worth the trouble.;2;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2354;4/11/2010;6wmvq6WMzpxQ;-_gihqWuppoSHSR-qSbg5g;Great location to scout Chicago from. Loved the rooms:dark and sexy  and modern  The rooms are small yeah- but- you aren't moving in with all your stuff are you? Its cozy and romantic and you can see Chicago from your window. One of the best little, reasonably priced boutique hotels in Chi-town.;4;1;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2355;5/19/2011;FKBj49vSiRz9A;muT5z0-LJKiLwSWYTc590Q;This place has one flaw- room sizes. Depending on the purpose of your trip, this could either be a no big deal, or a huge one! I wanted to book a hotel in the downtown River North area, but not mag mile. Those hotels are often huge, loud, not updated. Arriving at Hotel Felix, I was pleased with small lobby, friendly front desk staff and modern decor. HOWEVER, the room I first got was incredibly small! My walk in closet in my house is bigger! I was traveling alone, but this room was claustrophobic! I can't imagine how a couple or worse- a family could stay in that room. I was ready to walk out but called the front desk first, and they put me in a slightly bigger room, which was better. All in all, this place COULD have been great, but the room size has left with a serious handicap when compared with other hotels in similar price range...;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2356;3/7/2010;sQVs;25z3JDmt-XQ0lpGY3pskQA;My girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend vacation in March. It was $80 bucks a night, which we thought was a great deal. The negative reviewers here need to suck it up. The rooms are small, but big enough for me to work at a desk while my girlfriend watches TV, and big enough for us to dance around the room after consuming several bottles of wine. No coffee machine in the room? Waah, waah, you actually have to WALK TO AN ELEVATOR for free coffee. We loved the Hotel Felix and will be staying there whenever we visit. Here are things we liked:  -The hotel seems to have a real commitment to sustainability  -The bed is extremely comfortable  -The black-out curtain is AMAZING  -The entire hotel has a consistent and appealing visual style  -Free Wifi  -Friendly staff  -Good location, close to the Red line and many buses Things that weren't so good:  -The fitness center is small and lacking some equipment  -The bathroom sink is really hard to use;4;2;0;1;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2357;2/8/2011;fCjUnOBeeCULpGAcjLdwXQ;VoqJc4XwMu5XpYvUUH41Eg;One of my most favorite hotels...in the country. Have stayed here twice: 2009 and 2011. Fun, eco-friendly boutique hotel in downtown Chicago (great location walking distance from Mag mile) with a stylish looking lobby and bar area. The beds are so comfortable. Modern decor, nice amenities such as a spa but old city charm. Of course, quite clean. The staff are quite helpful and nice, hotel is not too big. Feels comfortable and not over the top like the chain hotels. AND, it's affordable! Call for the best deals or look online for specials. Highly recommend.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

What was especially nice was when I got stuck there for two additional nights during a blizzard, they not only did not gauge me on the price, but actually dramatically discounted the room rate for the 2nd two nights.  Very nice, and very appreciated.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2359;2/26/2011;CBkhI;WctC4-LK2CXS_NfOrC04uA;Named our price on priceline not knowing what we were going to get and we ended up with a nice hotel. The only reason i am giving 3 stars is because the rooms are so small. The hotel was clean and smelled great but the room was tiny not even a dresser. I had stayed the earlier part of the week at the Swissotel and with the size of the rooms and the views there it is hard to compare the two. The staff was very friendly and the bed was very comfortable. I did like the free wifi and free parking for hybrids which is a big plus in a town where parking is close to $50 a night.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2360;11/29/2009;unwsXQGz-yU8ECQ7tSqqJw;BSH6pJ05OEvE92piiJE2PA;This is about the hotel lobby bar. Damn, I want their fireplace in my house. It was so toasty and warm. I will be back when it's really cold out and will order overpriced wine or drinks just to sit next to it. The lighting could have been a bit dimmer at 10:30 on a Saturday night but I guess it has to be bright since it's part of the lobby. The bartender was cool. We actually didn't stay and order drinks because it was too pricey for what we wantede. But that fireplace...I can't wait to enjoy it again on a super cold day.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2361;10/18/2010;0brihsat9xvosNrFiTJcYg;MtFr0WgUAK3boXGvtNWfyw;The hotel Felix is NOT a design hotel, but it is a much better alternative to   chain hotels of any sort. It's located in the up-and-coming Near North neighborhood which is comprised of galleries, bars and amazing new restaurants. It is an "eco-hotel" which I love and wish more hotels would do but I found myself bored by this place. But then again, I am a designer and I base my reviews on snobby things like lighting and architectural features. Most will enjoy this place, but next time I'll stay at the James. I should mention that the service was great and there was good coffee.;3;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2362;2/4/2011;pza2A5mHJuUw635805Izaw;QM_C9X9u4tVqIBV84Dlgxw;Great boutique hotel - nothing bad to say at all.  It's the Four Seasons of it's price range.  I stay at nice hotels and this is amazing for the price. The housekeepers are assigned to a floor so they are almost like butlers - they get to know you and are there to help you in any way.  Also this hotel is close to all the good restaurants like XOCO, Maggianos, Bandera, etc.  Best of all, a Whole Foods in just a short block away.  Amazing.  Staff could have been a little nicer/better (less snooty feeling) but they were ok enough.  Their restaurant's food is REALLY good too - especially brealfast.  Highly recommend.;5;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2363;5/31/2010;PjqH1NkpvK2o-jF5BThYCw;U6_ZuumXvqYlgKA75E2pDg;Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. It was a very nice modern hotel and the employees were nice. Overall, I was not impressed with this hotel. The standard room was one of the smallest rooms I have stayed in. They do not have mini refrigerator in the standard room, which would have been quite useful to bring home leftovers. We had to waste food because there was not a place to store the food. Also the maid service was not great. They knocked on our door at 8:30am one morning, which was a little too early after a night of going out. After using the washcloths, we were instructed to leave it on the floor if we wanted a new one for the next day. After that was done, they failed to pick them. They also did not replace the soap as well. Not a place I would return to in the future;2;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

2365;10/3/2010;gMo6llo6RQ6bQhzYl6-i2A;tMlff--fiJG-1-AL4NaDkQ;Received an amazing deal for the hotel that I could not pass up - $130/night.  Found the deal through http://bing.com which led me to the online booking engine, http://www.easyclicktrav….  Basically purchased the room "on request" which means your room is not confirmed.  Easyclicktravel contacts the hotel to see if they will sell the room for the "on request" price...and within 48 hours the TA will either confirm your room or not.  Lucky for me, the room confirmed. Moving onto the hotel...the review will be done in categories (at least the categories most important to me). Room:  Clean, modern and sleek.  Definitely liked the decor and the cleanliness.  This is a boutique hotel and I have found that the synonym for boutique is small.  I booked a regular hotel room and it was much smaller than what I'm used to.  There was very little walking room around the bed and the small desk.  Personally, cleanliness overrides room size for me so I'd still give the room category 4 stars. Transportation:  Chicago's public transportation is easy, reliable, and clean.  From O'Hare airport, you can take the blue line to the hotel.  It is a bit of a walk from the closest blue line stop to the hotel though so be prepared to walk.  There are buses that you can take from the blue line stop to the hotel though, but I didn't try that option.  The red line stop is much closer to the hotel.   Sight-seeing:  The hotel is in a great location.  If you don't mind a nice walk, you can walk to Navy Pier, Magnificent Mile, Museums, etc.  The hotel is also a few train stops away from Wrigley Field, Soldier Field, parks, etc. Food:  The hotel is walking distance to many great restaurants.  Each night my bf and I would take a stroll to our restaurant of choice and walk back.  That options were endless.  The restaurants ranged from nice, pricey restaurants to economical down right grubbing restaurants.   Service:  The bellmen were super nice.  Always greeted the guests when they arrived or left the hotel..  Always willing to provide suggestions, give directions, etc.  The front desk personnel were a bit snobby.  I'm not sure if the attitude came with the motif of the hotel - green, boutique hotel, but I thought they could have been a bit more friendly. Overall, the hotel is in a great location.  I'd definitely stay here again...but not for more than $200/night.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

We just love it!   We used to live in Chicago we love to come home often, and Hotel Felix is quickly becoming our home away from home.  The first time we stayed here we fell in love with the hotel. It was just what we were looking for, somewhere environmentally friendly, somewhere small and quiet but close to everything and a chic modern design.   My family also stayed here and loved it.;4;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

I came here with a couple of friends and when we booked this hotel, I had high expectations from the pictures that the hotel posted online. Let me tell you, this hotel exceeded all of my expectations. It has a superb location, very close to the magnificent mile, bars, old town, zoo..you name it. The beds were the most comfortable beds I have ever laid on. We created a schedule for ourselves everyday but we always woke up late because we did not want to get out of bed...and it's not from us being hung over either (except for one of us but I won't get into that). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The bellboys were awesome, especially Chuck! He helped us find some amazing local eateries and bars and was just awesome to talk to. They also have a gym, which isn't too big but hey, who goes on vacation to work out in the gyms at their hotels right? Bottom line, the service is great, very affordable, very clean, and great location.;5;1;1;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2368;2/20/2010;R6vHb7sajyoISypiYnTYAQ;ptgFdw9WzPQx16w37XxsPQ;Once again I have to ask if the more negative reviews are really about this hotel.  Or have people confused Hotel Felix with Hotel Fleabag down a little further on Clark?  I honestly cannot say anything negative about this hotel, except that the noise from the late night rowdies on Clark Street made it all the way up to my eighth floor room.  The hotel has little control over that.  The hotel is eco-friendly, so there are all kinds of nice touches (a small recycling container in the bathroom, eco-friendly bath products, and so on).  In keeping with this motif, the hotel decor is simple and elegant with muted eath colors throughout--my room was one of the more restful looking rooms I've ever stayed in.  Everyone on the staff from the doormen to the desk clerk to the maids was friendly and helpful, and this friendliness seems to influence even the guests: everyone with whom I shared elevators and hallways was pleasant and chatty.  Yes, most rooms are smaller than usual, and the closet is very very tiny--so if you're looking for wide open spaces, move to Utah (as the song goes).  Otherwise, Hotel Felix is a very pleasant way to enjoy a weekend in the city.  And of course Hotel Felix is home to the wonderful restaurant,  Elate--but that's another review . . . . . .;5;0;1;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

What hotel does that? The products in the shower were great! The bed nice and soft, the room service yummy, and the room was always clean! My two complaints, the shower curtain, it was too short, and the cable! NO Vh1, Bravo, or MTV!! Whaaaa? I was there a week! Other than that, I believe if you facebook them, they offer deals that are an AWESOME rate. There is also a Whole foods within walking distance, several places to eat, and Michigan Ave is close. it's also across the street from Angels and Kings. Also, the restaraunt Elate is FANTASTIC!

The rooms and beds are super tiny. The bed felt comfortable when we sat down on it but we woke up in pain every morning. We found this hotel as part of a secret deal on Hotwire and because of that I feel we were given a room next to the elevator, and I mean right next to the elevator. Any time and at all hours we could hear the elevator chime and whoever was in the hall way. Even the elevators in this hotel were small but at least there were 3. The walls were also extremely thin and on several occasions we could hear the couple in a room by ours having sex. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. I also appreciate that this hotel was eco friendly but it seems like they took a Holiday Inn, put some fancy light fixtures in the lobby, slapped an eco friendly brand on it and called it 4 stars.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel or stay there again, not at least for the price we paid.;2;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

The room I was staying in with my boyfriend was 3A and it was a gorgeous room (I love the exposed brick wall.) The room was huge and well heated (We came in late February.) We were so close to SOOOOO much. We visited Wrigleyville which was really close about 3 or 4 blocks I believe, walked to boystown which is right down the block almost which is so much fun with all its shops and everything, and went to downtown Chicago on the Red Line.

Generally, I find Priceline's star levels to be accurate. Not this time.The hotel is far from a 4*. The Felix has wholly inadequate--almost ludicrously small--rooms. I was initially placed in a tiny room:but asked to be moved. This was done. The second room was marginally larger but, like the first, it lacked a closet:instead, there was a curtained-off niche which served as a kind of closet, though the bar for hanging clothes was a mere 15" or so in length. There was no dresser:indeed, there was no space even to leave a suitcase open on the floor. The room had sufficient room for the bed and almost nothing else.I have been in many hotels in Europe, so am accustomed to rooms that are small by American standards. I have never been in rooms there as small as those at the Felix.There were housekeeping problems, too. The rug in the room was filthy:when I pulled back the bedding to sleep, there were long blond hairs on it. (I have dark brown hair.) "The laundry must have missed it" was the explanation offered by a staffer.Never again.;2;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2379;2/21/2011;E7W0t_UUdC2aF6sYkzPG4w;YCwUyIPXBcsXNKLsJDHcKg;We booked Hotel Felix using Priceline for my family and me. We were shocked when we got this boutique hotel, as we have successfully used priceline in the past for many family outings in the city.  We definitely were hesitant once I read the reviews.  We checked in at 3:30 and they did not have two queen beds available.  We were then told that if we can wait 30 minutes they will have a room ready.  Great!  We took the kids to dinner (and told them we would be back in an hour).  We got back to the hotel a little after 5:00 and the room was still not ready.  We finally got into our room at 5:30.  During our wait, a hotel representative came out and gave us two drink tickets (a glass of wine was $11 each) and two boxes of chocolates for the kids.  This was not a great start since the hotel lobby alone is not kid friendly.  I felt like I had to keep shushing my kids (8, 6, and 3).We finally got into our room with two double beds.  Oh my, this is the SMALLEST room I have ever stayed in.  I stayed in much larger rooms in Europe and New York.  I completely agree with one reviewer that stated it is smaller than a cruise ship room.  We had no more than a few feet between the wall and bed.  I nailed my leg on the bed frame pretty good navigating between kids and luggage and I am sure our hotel neighbors heard me scream.  Again, this is not a kid friendly hotel!  The bed seemed smaller length wise (both my husband and mine were hanging off and we are under six feet tall).  The bathroom was clean, the middle table with the clock and lamp has never been dusted.  The HVAC was loud and rattled throughout the night...a sign that this was an older building with updates.  There was no desk for working - it was a small table with a tiny lamp - not sure how useful that would be.  Although the free wi-fi did work well.In the morning, my husband went down for complimentary coffee and they forgot to refill the pot at 8:30 AM and again at 9:30 - not 4-star service as it's listed on Priceline.This is the first time I have ever done a review.  I cannot stress how disappointed this hotel was labeled 4 stars.;2;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

Is rather, titillating, arousing, intense. A mental foreplay, that unfortunately leaves me wanting more. Yet, well worth the while, you are best served to leave this bar for your last call. Yes I know, some clown bragged about mimi, mimi this, mimi that, no. SUSIE, this displaced blond from california, with dreams in her eyes, emotions on her shoulders will engage you in your best drunken whimsical best. No matter your sense of being, drunk, stupidly drunk, saying what we believe to be golden wisps of of wisdom to anyone that would hear our sprawl, but instead of tallying us as another drunken drunk, Suzy entertains our inner demons, our hidden poets, our honest child, whatever it is that lurks in our drunken being, suzy nurtures that spirit. Where others may pass us by as silly or funny, archaic, Suzy will push us, see where our drunken dialogue leads us. Banter us, even.

When you first walk into the hotel, your initial reaction is that you picked the right spot...then you have to check-in. The guy we talked to was smarmy and rude. A week and again the day before arriving I called to confirm a request, both times the staff told me that it wouldn't be a problem & was saved in my reservation. When we arrived the front desk representative told me I was lying about the request because I didn't know who I talked to when I made the request. A lot of other Yelpers rated customer service high so maybe it was an off day or this employee (20-something male) is a bad apple, but our experience couldn't have been worse. When we finally got to the room, we opened the door to find a queen size bed & that was about it. The room was tiny and it took effort to fit between the walls & the bed. Reminded me more of a walk-in closet than a hotel room. The bathrooms were equally small with the smallest, most shallow sink that could be mistaken for a bird bath. Sleeping was more like playing "Name that noise" & we were on the 8th floor away from the elevators! The air conditioning was incredibly loud and woke us up every time it turned on. After a poor night's sleep, all I wanted was a cup of coffee to help me wake up. Never mind, coffee makers are not provided in the room instead offering complimentary coffee in the lobby.  Who doesn't like going to the lobby in your underwear to get some caffeine?  I travel a lot for work and cannot recall the last hotel room I stayed in without a coffee maker. This hotel is big on cutting costs and corners. I would have rated Hotel Felix as a 1 star if it were not for the location. Poor customer service, tiny rooms, loud hotel, and no extras describe our experience at Hotel Felix. It is better than staying at O'Hare, but not by much.;2;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw
2383;7/31/2010;Dm0k-QToLQ5IePXYHTMATg;Q0IfPVvxrIhP9a4grSY63Q;I really hated staying at the Hotel Felix.  My hatred was in part due to the fact that Priceline led me to believe I would be staying in a 4 star hotel - I wouldn't rate this place above a 2 - and it only gets that much because the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  I've never been more uncomfortable in a hotel room (or motel room, or in any random side of the road travel hotel I've ever stayed at).  The room is tiny, and I was awake all night listening to the air conditioner turn on and off (it made a loud booming sound - the maintenance guy said that's just the way it was made).  Also, while the eco-friendly thing is nice in concept, it also means that they do not allow you to turn your air below a certain level (central air) - sure the thermostat says 65, but it feels like 75 (or worse, sometimes it randomly blew out hot air).  The bed was short (though not uncomfortable) and there was no natural light.  The location is good but there are tons of hotels in this general area.  Unless you're on a seriously tight budget and need to book through Priceline, I wouldn't recommend staying here under any circumstances.  I don't plan on using Priceline again because of this experience - their rating system obviously can't be trusted.;1;0;0;0;p9aMkgTdOKhsjkkv4G0QBw

However I was running late and needed help decorating the room with roses and candles and when I called the front desk the concierge couldn't do nothing for me other than except flowers I ordered to the hotel which I had no time to do either way as it was late. I asked if they can possibly help put some candles in the room and they stated they were a smoke free hotel. I had to rush to downtown and do everything myself. In the morning I called the front desk to see if they had Advil and the lady said "Umm no. We have a pharmacy behind the hotel" very inconvenient I taught for a hotel in the middle of downtown Chicago.

Additionally, the location is really convenient.However, if you are going to pay full fare, I recommend making your reservation elsewhere.

In this day and age, every hotel should have wireless internet, but at the Palmer House Hilton we had to go downstairs and get a "wireless tower" at the bargain price of $15/day.

2404;9/27/2009;hoV6sVgc_WR9dXKlj3Zzow;tDjjZQmxFQJ_Ca9nkC8BXg;This review is solely for the rooftop bar, not the hotel. So I finally made it out to this bar. I feel like I've heard so much hype about the place, maybe I had too high of an expectation. But when I finally went this weekend, I was pretty disappointed. 1) The crowd was mixed in terms of race and age, which I like. But the quality of the crowd was not so good in terms of looks. And I'm not trying to sound snobby or anything like that. Maybe it was just an off night, but it was a Saturday night, so I was hoping it was poppin' with some beautiful people. If you truly want to see some good looking people, go check out Y-Bar or Enclave. 2) So there was a good sized line, but we greased the bouncer some money to get in for our party (9 people: 5 girls, 4 guys). One of the bouncers flat out lied to our face saying there's cover so we need to pay him more. But when we asked the other bouncer, he was perplexed saying there is no cover for entrance. Oh, so I guess that's one of the positives. There's no cover. 3) When we finally got into the bar, we didn't feel it was that crowded. At least the line outside should have been moving a lot faster, but I guess that's how all bars/clubs work, trying to look like they're super busy. So I won't knock any points for that. 4) The outdoor bar section was pretty sharp. The flat screen tvs, and the fire pits, and the chic decor made it feel like I was in that Barcardi mojito commercial. The view was good, but not fantastic.  5) Nothing much to say about the drinks or prices. It was as expected. So overall, it was just OK. Definitely over-hyped from what I've heard. It doesn't compare to Pure in Vegas or even some of the rooftop bars in NYC.;2;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w
2405;8/28/2009;8cQQ2eFMCaYxV7oKWZO0KA;yc2mvO6EOELcoqpODK0LfQ;I've been staying here for a week, due to my floors being redone at my home. The valet lost my car key, then gave me the wrong one.. The food here isn't great, although the Italian place here is good. State and Lake isn't all that good. The bfast isn't worth a penny... The rooms are nice, large for the price.. I a suite, and that was nice.. The technology in the phones in the rooms are a bit to much, to hard to figure out.. I just want to make a call!! They had free WiFi, but then with out notice, they are charging, I didn't like that!! I also had my family with me, and the crib they provided was something you would have found in an old Russian 1950's hospital.. VARY SCARRY!! We didn't end up using it.. Strange they have people get these cribs for hotels, who don't have kids!! All in all, for the price, I would stay here again, but there's a lot to improve on,...;2;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w
2406;7/14/2009;DDbHAjNY3lfsSgOCP-18oA;zpIVFoSArNfO6maPKj8KfA;Just returned from a 4 night stay and have a few additions to what's already posted....the rooms are adequate, and yes, you will hear some noise from the nearby L-train. Remember, you are in Chicago...if you wish to ride that same train there is a stop only a block away.  The comfort factor for the room is great, all the latest gadgets fit nicely on the workspace/desk, the bed is up to the new "heavenly bed" standards, bathroom is well set up (sink is a bit of a mistake, but shower, etc. are fine), and the TV has all the stations you could want.  Dined at both the restaurants and the food was outstanding (had the trout for dinner one night and breakfast every morning).  Prices are a little high-Hilton Diamond members get breakfast for free-so that's a plus.  Overnight parking was $45-again a little high for my taste, but the market rate for downtown Chicago.  Next time I may cab it everywhere and avoid that charge.  Given the location, you could also walk to plenty of attractions.  Rooftop bar was a scene worth checking out...even if it's not your scene.  Staff was very attentive, yes, they need some seasoning but they try hard so I give them high marks for that.  I will return sometime in the Fall, let's see if they get better at The Wit.;3;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w

The views are nice, but the drinks are truly the worst drinks I have ever had. I ordered a lemon drop martini. Not only did it taste funky, but I had to send it back to be shaken, because it was tepid when it was sent to me. tepid!! Our friend's mixed drink was pretty nasty as well...another one of the worst mixed drinks I've tried...not sure how he choked it down. Stick with beer or wine if you go.The decor was nice, lobby looked great, and had overenthusiastic greeters welcoming everyone...but we won't go back.;2;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w
2408;1/3/2011;jUInzLC2wONQ0zKYtWG3Zw;4WTyK_qp7Ru0MR_XG9v2Ag;I will never go back to Roof at the Wit Hotel... what a horrible experience there today 01/01/11... The service sucks and people that work there were very unprofessional &   extremely rude! They think that walking around patrolling the bar with their little secret service ear pieces make them feel more powerful, They are wrong about that, this give them a sense of power that they DO NOT have! We had been with some people that had been staying in the hotel that weekend. We had been ordering drinks and having an OK time, I then wanted to suggest a couple songs from the DJ "Trentino" AKA the Midget! who sucked By The Way! And then we had been quickly confronted by one of the security personal that obviously had napoleon complex and a power struggle complex, because he swiftly told me that I was not allowed near the DJ booth and he then proceeded to stand in front of me trying to be a jerk, He and the other security officers had starred me down and then shortly after this ordeal we had been taking pictures of our party and the security asked us why we had been taking so many pictures, like its a crime! And why we had been taking pictures of the security, like that's a crime as well! Then they gave us our check and proceeded to escort us out and that's when one of our party members wanted to know after we had spent a good deal of time there and lots of money why they thought that we should leave??? The security then became very aggressive and physical with one of the people in our party. This escalated to the security getting aggressive and then they physically started to push our friend who was staying at the hotel out of the bar, then after they had him in the hallway by the elevator 2 more security officers joined in the physical activity and proceeded to physically assault our friend which ended up physically harming our friend. They said that he was going to go to jail but they released him from their custody shortly after they had held him. The only thing that is worth any thing at the wit it is the cool city view... won't recommend to anyone to go!!! So save your money and go to all the best places our Chicago has to offer!;1;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w

2412;5/13/2010;oYiAa6RJBxHNnzYM6wAgAw;cfQlwaZ_rX4ihlnLly6QEw;I decided to take my mother to the rooftop bar at the wit on mother's day for a few cocktails. i wanted her to see a trendy boutique hotel such as the wit. we first sat down in the middle of the rooftop area. there were some stool-level gas heat lamp-type things. a server approached us but we weren't ready. we then decided the smell of the gas was uncomfortable, so we took a seat at the bar on the far end. it wasn't open but there were plenty of available stools and there was already 1 other gentleman there. upon switching seats, i notified our cocktail waitress and she said something like 'that's fine. someone should be w you shortly'... after 10 mins, no one came. we proceeded to move indoors because of nobody coming and it got cold. another 10 mins went by and it wasn't until i made eye contact w the manager on duty that i then saw him asking 'are those 2 being taken care of?' to a waitress... 1st round of drinks was fine. we had the prosecco w grenadine... too much grenadine at the bottom of the glass but it was ok. i had a glass of prosecco as my second and it was FLAT. there were barely any bubbles. i was completely dissatisfied, however i didn't complain. i'm now writing this review on here to share my unpleasant experience. the space was cute. the over-head lighting in the indoor portion of the rooftop was kind of tacky. i think a more glamorous, edgy chandelier would be more appropriate than those LED lights. i don't recommend going to the rooftop... may i sugguest the terrace at trump? cocktails are $12 at the wit versus $14 at the trump, a whopping $2 difference. also, the view of the river, navy pier, and various skyscrapers is stunning. there really is no comparing. the wit is edgy and the trump is a little more sophisticated... however, the terrace isn't a suit & tie environment. when considering everything (drinks, prices, views, facility), the wit can't compare to the terrace at trump;2;0;0;0;fH7EwQ9j_Ab1NJNYMoHA3w

Parking in downtown Chicago is a B***h, thanks to Mayor Dayle. Parking is tight and expensive. Got into town later in evening and closes parking I could find was 5 blocks away (this is why valet parking is so expense at all of the downtown hotel).

2428;9/20/2011;z6gn7xAqFayFU63U3pTjAQ;hP9yH49ZgTiYOdgQwGg35g;As we arrived to the hotel's proximity on Wacker, we could hear its name being shouted before we saw it. The base of the hotel was covered in groups of picketers with angry signs beating pots and pans. Once we made our way through the angry crowd, we found the lobby to be very impressive and immense. It took us a few minutes before we could locate the actual front desk that was up the escalator and on the second floor. Our room was on the Regency Level on the 34th floor with amazing views of the lake, Chicago River and the downtown skyline. The bed was very comfortable and the room was of a modern style. It was a nice looking room:however, it was pretty dusty. In the bathroom, the water pressure was so weak that it was a let down since they had such a nice looking shower. Another upsetting factor was that you could still hear the angry crowd from the street below banging their pans and shouting at all hours of the day from the 34th floor! It was horrible. The first night that we were there, we had a lady use a key card and enter our room (even with our privacy sign on the door) a bit after 10pm! We were in bed and were very shocked to find a person opening our room's door. We immediately called the front desk who then transferred me to security. About 20 or so minutes later, security arrived at our room to "interrogate" the lock. He said it was most likely a "benign" situation and probably housekeeping (after 10pm!?!). He fiddled with the lock and then disappeared without a final explanation to me and my husband. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well that night. With every noise we heard, we thought someone was coming in our room again. With us being unsure of housekeeping, or who ever was coming in our room, we decided to not have our room serviced during our stay. From the sound of it, they wouldn't have serviced it anyways. We spoke with another family in the building and they had been there three days waiting for someone to service their room. They were starting to make bets on whether or not their room would be clean each time they went back into their room. Basic cleanliness is a necessity for any hotel--it doesn't matter how large and how many rooms you have. In result of the picketers, more than half of the hotel restaurants were not in working order and were closed. In addition, there was no room service. We specifically chose a Hyatt hotel in the Chicago area so we would have restaurants close by since this was our first time to the city. This was a let down after flying from the West Coast. We decided to eat at the breakfast buffet on our second day and I would not recommend it. For the two of us, it cost $40 some dollars and the food was less than impressive. I only ate a third of a Denver omelet (the eggs were runny and the vegetables were crunchy), a piece of cantaloupe and some yogurt. Should have left the hotel for some real food for a fraction of the price! The proximity to sightseeing things and the ability to get a cab in a hurry is great. Just remember, you will have to walk through picketers to get in or out of the cars. All in all, we will not be returning nor will we recommend this hotel to anyone--family, friend or stranger. I actually joined yelp to share this story because I know how important reviews are and people should know this hotel is having some major issues. Don't let this hotel ruin your Chicago getaway!;1;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2431;4/23/2011;FbXsXzn-jaH1tykELt_u7A;3jpbUcPNI1m6tJVflMWjZA;Paid more than $200 per night in this hotel with high expectations and after I had heard so much about it in Yelp. One of the most disappointing stays I have had in such a talked about hotel. I had been told I was getting a room with two queen beds. When I checked in, I was told the room is not available so I was given a king sized bed in supposedly a renovated wing of the hotel. After getting into the room, I found out that it was renovated for sure - the room was still smelling heavily of paint. The bed was a king size roll out bed - yes, you got that right! A roll out bed for $200+ per night. There were no lights on the side of the bed so one had to get up everytime and go the the lights at the corner of the room to switch them on/off. All night, there was periodic slamming noise come out just outside my door after every 30 mins or so. I was too tired to find out and just wanted to get a night's rest. In the morning I figured out, it was the ice machine and all night due to some issue, there was a crashing noise coming from it. I would stay at a Marriott Courtyard anyday, at least I know what I would be getting for a much better rate.;2;0;0;0;NkOir65b_YAAQVlJR_zmJA

2433;4/8/2012;xWU2PZVehmmfyS_kSt8Yzg;RKIBvAjPm80hU7O4J0GXJg;This hotel is a historic landmark. I feel like I'm in a old Black and White Mafia Movie! The room has a great view of Michigan Ave. The first room I had was on the third floor as well. It was very cold and I had to call the front desk and they mentioned the heat was not turned on and mentioned they will bring me a portable heater and small blanket. It took a very long time to receive the heater and extra blanket and I had to be at a meeting:so I left and when I returned to the room the heater was sitting on the dresser and extra blanket on the bed. When I attempted to take a shower there was no hot water nor warm water. I had another meeting soon and I needed to shower so I went downstairs and spoke with the manager and she changed my room to the ninth floor. As I entered the new room I noticed a big difference. The bed was a California King from a King in the room on the third floor. The furniture was newer and nicer and the new room actually had a desk and the room was bigger, cleaner, and more modern looking. The bed are still generic brand that I never heard of and the bed is not that comfortable where you can feel the springs and the linen is scratchy. The television channels are basic and the Internet is Ethernet and cost $9.99 a night. No microwave. No fridge. The heat works in this room. If your room faces Michigan Ave or the Lake you will feel the Windy City through your windows. In the new room the water takes a while to become warm and never turned hot and the water was brown at first as well. I believe it's time for my investor friends or any investor to come along and buy the Congress Hotel and tear it down like a old hotel on the Vegas strip and build a new one. Wasting renovations on the current hotel is not helping and giving 20% spring discounts for a rate of $79 per night does not assist me wanting to stay another night! I have stayed at this hotel two prior times checking in after 4a with my significant others after a long night of partying and I guess I never noticed anything not worth staying here until I checked in sober for the first time. The highlight of my two nights at this hotel was being taken care of at Enclave Friday night and having complimentary entry with PASSWORD=MAVERICK and Enclave Saturday with PASSWORD=MAVERICK then we headed to V Live where we purchased our tickets with this link: http://ticketdriver.com/…;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

If your looking for a romantic getaway go to the Essence Suites in Orland Park or the Sybaris.. We ended up at the Essence & it was well worth the aggravation... Oh & the hotel was on Strike. They had strikers out front. ARGH Terrible Terrible Hotel.. Will not even try to stay here again....;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2438;6/13/2007;IHleAzZ3Ts9_xTZxe9I83w;fsHMVMeIVKsJf2_66FOIvQ;I'm going out on a limb to give it three, as the hotel has potential.  It needs some reinvestment and better help.I don't know if the housekeeping and food service has to do with the strike, but I suspect not.  I stayed there in 1984 when it was the Americana Congress, and it was a little tired and dingy back then.  I don't expect a posh resort, especially at the price point of Congress. If it were up to its full potential, I would have to pay two or three times the rate, as you might expect to pay for a room in the Gold Coast or on the river.  But at the minimum, it is in need of new carpeting and better housekeeping.  I didn't feel comfortable walking anywhere in the room bare-foot.  The complimentary breakfast was mediocre, and the food servers were friendly but not terribly professional or efficient.   On a positive note, the location is great for tourists.  Bus lines, taxis and trains are all within easy walking distance, and it's right in the middle of the great museums and parks.  I would say it's a good location for the beginner who would like to see the more popular attractions, just bring flip-flops and spend the extra money and have your breakfast in a cafe nearby.I would not rule out the possibility of staying there again, but if I can find a comparable rate for a place in a geographically desireable location, I'll look at it.;3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2439;10/29/2011;mccWFRPQ3uhASqflOqS9pA;K3ZXT_O-TpAfQ3yYS_TipA;I had the worst hotel experience ever in the Congress Plaza Hotel. Despite of all the inconvenience I experienced during my stay, including the strike was going on, the toilet was not working and there was no wireless internet access, I was not planning to write a yelp review until The Congress Plaza Hotel Security lied to me:11:45am on Dec 22, 2011, 45 minutes after we checked the hotel, my daughter found out she left her retainer on nightstand in the hotel room. I called the front desk and I was transferred to Hotel Security. The gentleman on the phone took down my information and asked me to call back one hour later. I called the Security at 12:45pm, the person on the phone told me that they could not find my daughter's retainer. I asked if housing keeping had cleaned the room, the person emphasized that the house keeping was in the room while the security checked out the retainer for me. The person even said that the security also checked house keeping's garbage bag to make sure no retainer was there.My daughter was very sure that she left her retainer in the hotel, so we decided to go back the hotel to check out the room ourselves (around 3:00pm). We found out the room was not even been cleaned yet, and surely my daughter's retainer was still on the nightstand.As a frequent traveler, I left stuffs in hotel many times. The hotel staff and the house keeping were always very helpful. I could not believe that the Congress Plaza Hotel could not hold up the basic hotel standard to help it's customers to locate stuff they left in their hotel room. This instance is a reflection of poor hotel management which leads bad customer experience.;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2440;10/20/2011;B0JCyH0MtF44rL8t5ZI5_w;2uhAavQiaAU21CaBbVe8bg;Stayed here 10/15/11 because its fairly close to the united center.  Booked our room back in August with a 72-hour special, still paid $156 for 2 people for 1 night.  Figured that's just the city for you.  We were totally excited because the website makes the place look amazing.  However, the website is TOTALLY misleading.Parking is in addition to your room.  The valet was adequate, its $33 to valet your car or $28 to park it yourself around the corner.  The lobby is okay, looks tired and old (not in a good way).  Could use a remodel. We stayed in the Buckingham Wing, which I guess is where all the smoking rooms are.  There was a stale smoke smell in the hallways and the room. The tiny elevator reeked of some kind of cleaning agent, which was okay I guess.  The room was very basic, which is fine because we were only staying one night.  Their website boosts beautiful views, but our room was across from Colombia college, and a fire escape.  You can hear everything going on in the hallway and the street below. Got hungry late at night (around midnight) so we found a pizza place nearby called Pauly's (or something like that).  The area is okay, not great.  I slept on top of the sheets and without a pillow, I was terrified of bed bugs. We couldn't wait to leave in the morning, if that tells you anything about the place.;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w

It was a really great deal ($140/night on Michigan avenue can't be beat) and the location was very convenient. Yes it was old. Yes the room was dated. But everything was clean, we had a decent view and the staff we encountered were all friendly. This is not a 5 star hotel and you don't pay for a 5 star hotel so don't expect that.

2443;9/18/2011;sepccWn1uiKIT8EcbZ3pXQ;912kQnXUkwRiw2Gp0FlYDw;For a recent trip to Chicago, I made the grave error of booking my hotel stay at The Congress Plaza Hotel....Here's where a typical hotel reservation turned into the worst hotel experience ever!In transit to Chicago, I realized I left my wallet at home. I had my passport & $300 cash so I figured I'd be fine for the weekend. When checkinginto The Congress, I was told by the  clerk that my online reservation was for only 1 night. I apologized & explained that I left my wallet (with CCs) at home.I offered several options for me to pay for the remaining 2 nights: Paypal, wire transfer, or calling a friend who can pay for the room with their CC. The clerk said  "I have to talk with my manager." The manager comes out & tells the clerk that I have to check out tomorrow. The manager didn't discuss the issue with me. Basically, he didn't try to find an acceptable solution . In the Morning :Called a friend to make an online payment on hotel website. Payment accepted. I feel the matter is resolved. I left my hotel room for  breakfast. Returning to my room, I discover that my room card is deactivated. I go to the front desk & was told that the hotel canceled the online payment because it wasn't paid with my  CC.ME: You got to be kidding me?!MANAGER: We can't accept payment if we don't have the CC holder info.ME: The payment was accepted and then you canceled it?  How would you like me to pay for the room?MANAGER: You can call your friend & ask him to fax a copy of the back/front of his CC, driver license & letter stating  he authorizes the payment.ME: Fine.Call to friend:  I explained what the manager is requesting.FRIEND: OMG...I have my kids  I can't do that right now.ME: Okay, don't worry:I'll call someone else.I  reach another friend, explain the situation, and ask him for help. He  has to drive to his office for a fax machine. After 45 minutes, my friend calls me & says that all the  docs have been faxed to the hotel.ME: Did you receive fax from my friend?MANAGER: Yes.I called my friend to thank him, so he leaves the office.  5 minutes later the manager returns & tells me he needs another faxed copy of the CC, because the back of the CC is not signed & a CC authorization form has to be completed.  I'm now frustrated & say "You couldn't tell me that the first time? My friend left his office.I called my friend back, "Sorry my man! ...FRIEND: I left the office!  @#* &*!!!!!!!!!. Why didn't they tell you this before..?ME : I'm sorry but they're threatening to kick me out of the hotel, I don't have my wallet, my cash is running out...I truly need your help.FRIEND: OkMANAGER: I received the letter but it didn't note the precise amount for full payment of the hotel stay & it doesn't have the signature on the fax. ME TO MY FRIEND: The clerk says she doesn't have the fax with your signature.FRIEND: I sent it. The clerk was misspoke about not receiving the letter with my friend's signature. The manager comes out & says "I have it, but the signature on the CC & on the letter isn't the same. At this point, I lose my temper & started to scream. I said to the manager "Put yourself in my situation.  I've proposed several different payment options, none of which you accepted:I have contacted 2 friends, both of whom made payment for this reservation but you canceled both payments...and you expect me be calm?!  I've been down here for two hours trying to resolve this issue!"MANAGER: Sir, you are making a scene. Now you are not staying in the hotel. Hotel Security will escort you out of the hotel. HOTEL SECURITY: Sir, you have to leave.Before I knew it my belongings were put in trash bags & I was escorted by 4 chicago officers outside in front of a 4-star hotel. I'm very lucky that i wasn't arrested.;1;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2444;7/12/2011;nWfoQrV4iZktl3GYkefydg;HhinNHoXCdxo28uuiS0vxQ;I stayed in this hotel last night, and felt compelled to write a review. I was at the hotel on business for one night. Upon arriving I was struck by the nostalgic feel. I said to myself "this place must have some great history", and went to the Internet. First thing that came up was that it was haunted. Great. I'm not into that kind of stuff and have no desire to experience it, so quickly became less enthused with the prospect of staying there. It was already 10:30 PM though so I didn't have a lot of choice. First, the hotel itself: I was greeted warmly by the check-in staff, and enjoyed chatting with her. I was put on the 10th floor of the south tower. I had no problems with the elevators whatsoever. The corridors looked vintage:it was like a flashback in time. Kinda cool. Ditto for when I entered the room. It had a classic look to it: crown molding that had been over painted through the years, older wallpaper but which had the hotel's logo, a pedestal sink in the bath. Certainly nothing fancy but at the same time everything you need. Ample work space, a flat screen tv mounted on the wall, and the bed was a little hard but nothing bad. My view of the lake was spectacular. The only problem I had was the noise from the street. It was a Monday night but there seemed to be a lot of vehicle activity. Busses, trucks, loud motorcycles, cars with their radio jamming, the L-train. I heard it all until around 2:00AM or so, which surprised me a bit since I was on the 10th floor. So did I see any paranormal activity? Nothing I saw, but two times just as I was drifting off to sleep I hear the faucet in the bathroom start for 5 seconds or so and then turn off. The first time I layer there frozen. I started to drift off again and about an hour later I heard it again. This time sprang out of bed, ran to the bathroom and turned off the light. I saw nothing. I took a towel and dried out the sink:if it happened again and I went in there and it was wet, then I would know for sure something was up. It didn't happen again. So I will let you make up your own mind as to what it was, but I am 99% sure that it wasn't the toilet running or coming from another room. In short, it freaked me out a bit. In summary, I thought it was a nice hotel that just felt kinda dead. There just weren't a lot of people there and the place felt empty. Of course it was a Monday night. Anyway, I won't stay there again, but solely because of the whole haunted thing. I'm just not into that. If that doesn't bother you then I would go for it. It's a nice slice of history situated in a great location.;3;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2445;7/7/2011;KuTivtKLNTUbVAqnm3Fp-A;dtFVhKEGfb0FP1TGmzHn9w;I love this hotel!! After reading the reviews I was a little nervous so I called and spoke to a manager advising her of the not so good reviews online. She upgraded my room on the spot and advised that she would do her best to upgrade (at check-in) to a lakeview room - which she did! Once we were there, the beauty of the hotel just knocked me out! From the lobby to the gold elevators to the room itself (with a lakeview and of course the view of The Taste) were fantastic!! Location was the biggest plus - it was just perfect!! Yes it's an older hotel but I think that adds to the beauty. Yes, they say it's haunted but we didn't experience any of that - too bad, might have been cool. And yes, there were picketers but they didn't bother me in the least. The only warning I would have is that parking in the garage behind the hotel can cost you $28 - $33 per day. All in all, I will go back again and again!;5;0;0;0;cXKeY0NugFvCSHRWJcOq9w
2446;5/15/2012;5NOG6qAdwdFb1RihxHUraQ;TupXdw0igjz5MtNoYvfepw;This is a good place for single men or a brief stay.  We were there for 1 week... Too long for this room.   The bed dominates the room.  There is nowhere else to sit to watch tv(which malfunctioned) or even sit and relax.  There is minimal closet space and the only drawers are in 1 bedside table.   The bathroom is functional, but small.  In order to appear larger, the shower is totally glass... Open to the bed area, they do provide a curtain, but the entire bathroom is visible to the bedroom if you forget to close it.  (every day, as the maids must be instructed to open it daily).  There are limited bathtubs in the hotel.  Don't count on getting one.The hotel has a modern euro feel to it, but the staff is either unconcerned or clueless. The exception was the doormen, they were helpful and pleasant.   We were there for the weekend nights and the hotel turns into a party... Great if you don't want to sleep.  We could hear the music from the bar as well as people yelling and running in the halls.  We don't plan on going back.;3;0;0;0;LDze56Nd8rRljNDMaD1sbA
2447;10/2/2011;3QjUsuCsyDESBj6XCHhxWQ;q1uE4f-RrArPTAEP7Ga8zg;I would not recommed this hotel.  The staff was very rude.  A hotel security in a suit stopped me from taking photos inside the hotel.  He was extremely aggressive with me, got really close to me, and seemed to have issues other than keeping the hotel safe.  He and other staff left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   They didn't seem to appreciate my business.

2454;12/4/2011;sIBGLEfCzlyfQRFXeUi_hg;7nxEMeqx1mSll76Z1_LvPw;We spent a huge amount of money getting a big suite.  When I called and booked it, they gave me one price.  When we showed up, they tried to charge me several hundred more.   I ended up getting the quoted price, but what a pain. Our main room was too dark, so we asked for a few lamps to be delivered to when we were going out for the evening. When we returned, there was just one more table lamp, and placed on the floor!  Then we discovered the TV didn't work.  When we called to report it, the first question was, "Is it plugged in?"  Did they think we were idiots?  Even if they thought we were, when your guest pays that kind of money, you just say you will send someone right up.  As it turned out, the TV was broken.  There were some loose hardware pieces in one of our bathrooms, too.  Granted, it's an old building and that is part of its charm, but they should make sure all the screws are tight.  It went down after a national chain hotel bought it, that is for sure.;2;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
2455;10/3/2011;8jPSiQ-OiGc27mhAGwqJTA;MGgKhPHnqKuET2neafUbBw;Nice hotel with small rooms.  Also, despite having booked a luxury room, they had none available at checkin.  I was moved to a slightly larger room when they could not fit a pack-n-play in the room I'd been assigned.  My biggest concern, however, is the security (or lack thereof).  Between the lobby and my room, someone managed to steal my cell phone and wallet, taking all of my money.   The thief discarded my wallet with credit cards in tact (they had rifled through the cards, but didn't take any), by leaving it in a cushion on an elevator.  While the staff was generally empathetic, I would have liked to have dealt with some onsite security personnel who could have investigated the incident and perhaps reviewed cam footage to identify the thief roaming their hotel.;2;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA
2456;7/17/2011;T4PmlxuoVDYekaqsFEG9RA;lH913sX4Mr7e8v2LMEAyJA;Not very impressed...The rooms are extremely tiny and poorly designed. Couldn't open the closet all the way because the TV stand was in the way. The bathroom was super small and did not have a built in fan. The entire place had a upscale/elegant look to it (which I understand due to its age), but with closer inspection the construction was poor. The trim and paint was chipping and uneven, the carpeting and wallpaper was old and needed updating. The walls were very thin and you could hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms next to you and in the hallway. The worst part of the stay was the service of the staff, which wasn't bad but I expected a lot more from this supposedly high end Chicago hotel. The staff wasn't rude or anything but seemed to have no emotions at all. A smile and hello goes a long way. A positive was the lake view my room had, facing Lake Michigan. Usually when I stay downtown the room is facing a brick wall or another window.;2;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

2463;9/6/2010;ILTwINHp66zmQQj7rGkbVQ;n5NjwkaEO1JS816pktEONw;I work for a wedding planning company in Chicago, IL and worked at a South Asian wedding last night at the Drake Hotel. We have done NUMEROUS weddings at various 4 and 5-star hotels within Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, so we had a certain expectation. Let me first off say that the banquet halls where the wedding was held were beautiful-the decor, the flowers, everything. HOWEVER...we were told by the hotel management that we could leave our personal belongings in a specific place at the hotel (which we always do), so that we could work and not worry about our stuff. After a few hours, we came back to find that the wallets of the 5 girls with whom I work (including myself) had been opened and all of our money had been STOLEN along with an iPhone! No guests had access to this room-it was only hotel staff. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM AT ANY OTHER HOTEL!!! I was completely disgusted. This is a hotel that claims to uphold a certain "standard", but they have apparently no requirements for when hiring people. To make matters worse, when we filed complaints with the security manager, he told us that "plenty of help gets hired for the day of any wedding and they're not actual employees of The Drake". Basically taking away any and all responsibility from the situation....I was completely APPALLED.It's not even the hundreds of dollars that were taken, but rather the principle of the matter. Coming to a hotel like the Drake, you expect a certain degree of professionalism from the staff and you certainly don't expect someone to violate you the way that we had been. As someone who has worked and attended a LOT of upscale elaborate weddings, I will NEVER recommend anyone to come to the Drake. They may have stolen a couple hundred bucks from us, but they're definitely going to be losing far more business.;1;0;0;0;31yYZQjEIyYE0N3p_vmoOA

2470;2/19/2012;FPGLn_UzTqsIiQh2-JWomQ;9ZLh2vK1tfWKJNVnJizDIg;I was upset about not being told i had to pick my vehicle up from valet by 2pm the following day. We went to pick it up at 3:30 and were charged an additional $20 (a total of $70 for less than 24 hours of parking!) The parking attendant woman kept saying their sign says to pick the car up by 2pm. We NEVER saw any signs because we used the valet at the hotel. While $20 isn't that much money it still left us with a bad taste in our mouths about the hotel. This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, but the bathrooms were very small. It's an older hotel so a lot of things weren't up to date. I can only give this hotel 3 stars at best.;3;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

2472;9/28/2011;CxV-o2IEGlyx1AZFc_z19g;Qk49fvvmAAtSE63PHZER6A;If I could give this place zero stars I would.Lets just say if your sister gets back from Iraq and you want to meet her in Chicago at the government rate (which she had MORE than earned). DO NOT come here. They refuse to accomodate military personnel in any room with two beds. So instead of a great rate for a returning soldier (190) you can instead pay more than you do on any travel site if you need more than one bed (415 was the quote for a double).Sad. You can have my priority club card back. PS your hotel front desk was just as bad if not worse than your 800 number rude staff. Trust me I will be telling everyone I know about this. The Holiday Inn/Intercontential?Crowne Plaza people DO NOT CARE about our returning soldiers. So much for our girls weekend.;1;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

Check out the fish n chips.  Btw the Elephant castle is in the Avenue Hotel.  Great place, bought in the package was affordable which equated to more beers at the game.  Me and my buddies were upgraded to a 1 bed room suites which were awesome.  Lots of room.  Free internet which is always a plus and the location couldn't be better.  We'll be back for another game and another stay.;4;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
2474;12/30/2010;f8tlBvQTqQWJE7juTIGU9g;KvWS4j5KuQVTxdVMJRtG6w;Brought our grandaughter here for her 15th birthday from Michigan. We ususally stay at the Hyatt on Wacker and will be going back there. First off, the hotel looks NOTHING LIKE THE ONLINE PICTURE and it tooks us 3 trips around the block to find the place because there was a small sign above the door. The valet was inside:no one to help us with our luggage. The desk clerk was about as friendly as a rock. We were on the 24th floor with a view of buildings-I had asked for a nice view for my grandaughter:couldn't change us. Cold air was pouring in the windows and the furnace never stopped blowing hot/cold air. The bathroom was a small joke:no fan and one plug. They didn't change the towels either and I had put them in the tub dirty. Very dark in the room and very few channels on the tv and 2 plugs for stuff. The rest were behind the bed and the dresser. The water was lukewarm with no pressure in the shower. Breakfast the next morning at the Sky Lounge was a huge expensive mistake. No postings, a small buffet with warm, dry food, a toaster that didn't work, no tables for more than 2 people so we had to sit on the couch and chair and balance food on our laps. My grandaughter had spiderwebs in her blueberries. I was charged for a juice I did not order. So we had eggs, meat, 2 thin slices of melon, 2 ordered juices (3) and  they gave us the bill -it was over $59- and we about fainted.The next morning we ate at the pub downstairs for about $20. The food was much better and the waiter at least smiled. When I complained I got the 'I'll tell the cook' which means 'whatever lady'. When we check out, again no valet around, he couldn't understand that we wanted our car:he kept trying to get us a cab. He finally told us the car was ready. Again no luggage help and it was at their garage around the corner that we had to walk to dragging all of our luggage. At least the attendant there helped us put it in the car. I've had better luck at the Holiday Inn. Yes I tried to complain but either no one was at the desk or they were so busy talking to one another they completely ignored us and other guests. I'm going back to the Hyatt. We spent $444- 2 nights with 2 queen beds, 2 nights parking at $48 per night and the breakfast. We took a 'shellacking' as Obama said.;1;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

2476;7/24/2010;DXmyobf2zi1BT_us_sHN1w;orKgNa2TI4w7F2uNwsacSQ;Vibrant City hotel in Chicago - Avenue Crowne Plaza!Wow the excitement of downtown Chicago - I love it!  As a first time visitor to this vibrant city I find myself looking out the hotel window of the Crowne Plaza Avenue Hotel just watching the excitement and the action of the city - the lights, the city noise, the people watching and all that.  Who needs to leave the hotel!  But alas this is a review of the hotel not of the city.  My husband and I wanted a quick weekend get away and as recent transplants to the Midwest, Chicago seemed to be an easy journey.  Scouring on line we stumbled upon the Avenue Crowne Plaza Hotel.  As most travelers do these days, we looked at the reviews and as many websites as we could find to research the hotel.  Time and time again we saw how comfortable the beds were, the positive comments on the guest rooms, location and all that - oh can't forget about the Zebra chairs.  I was intrigued to say the least.So we booked it and didn't regret the decision once during our stay.  The reviews were correct - Avenue Hotels rooms were spacious, the staff was courteous, the location was phenomenal, the beds were comfortable and the zebra chairs were awesome!We arrived mid day and while we waited for the check in time we took the opportunity to walk around.  So many shopping options nearby including the American Girl store.  I drug my husband in there to see what all of the talk was about.  The kids in there were going crazy about the American Girl Store.  Apparently not many American Girl Stores around, even talked to a family that came from Texas to get their American Girl hair done.  What?  Any who--we came back to the hotel, checked in and Sarah at the front desk was amazing.  She gave us some pointers on where to shop, dine and what clubs to hit.  Thank you Sarah - you were correct on all fronts!  We checked into a one bedroom suite and the suite was oversized, very spacious with great city views and yes - you do hear the city below even as high up as we were.  But when traveling to downtown Chicago our expectation was not to hear crickets and birds signing - our expectation is what we experienced.  The sounds of an alive city!  So all you review writers that were bothered by the sounds of the city perhaps should visit a ranch in Montana for your holiday?  Here's a hint..when you take a cruise you hear the ocean too.  Just sayin'Thank you to the Crowne Plaza Avenue Hotel for a great and memorable first time trip to Chicago!   We'll be back.;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

Not only is the hotel beautiful and chic, but the guest rooms are a good size, definitely the largest I have had the pleasure of staying in and the service is top notch. A girlfriend of mine was visiting from out of town, and I went for a visit. I absolutely love the hospitality world, and the Crowne Plaza did not disappoint. The decor is charming, especially the zebra chair - LOVE IT!!! Their beds are incredibly comfortable and in my opinion can't be beat. Best of all, breakfast on the 40th floor overlooking the city - just amazing!If you are traveling to Chicago and need a luxurious place to rest your head, this is it!;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
2478;11/21/2009;i6hu-fsG8A_k-s1CKvayzA;RJ7DBkgkkCJsRlcWe9gg8g;Great Business Trip to Avenue Hotel, ChicagoThe Avenue Hotel is a great business hotel with an unbeatable location and great amenities. The rooms were top-notch and everything about my visit went smoothly. The hotel is a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and all the shops and restaurants you could want.  If not for my business trip and more personal time was available it would have been ideal.  I must make a point of making it back here for a more relaxing trip in the near future.My room was clean, comfortable and had a great view.   The amenities were great and the bed was unbelieveable.  I don't remember ever having such a good night's sleep in a hotel much less on a business trip.  The staff at the Avenue hotel were wonderful.  From the front desk staff to the bellmen, guest services and housekeeping, the entire crew went out of their way to assist with plans both inside and outside of the hotel, and the hotel bar and its wait staff are experts at serving business groups -- attentive but not overbearing.In general, my stay at the Avenue Hotel was exceptionally smooth and productive. Our business meetings went smoothly, the rooms themselves were comfortable and had all the up to date equipment for presentations. I would recommend this hotel to any business group, but also to any tourist looking for a hotel convenient to many popular downtown Chicago spots!;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
2479;10/27/2009;gG8sMLFXvj1nG-X29M7rrw;ZDroz3x6RZFvM6kFMiMG-Q;We found Avenue hotel on a bargain hotel website for a spur-of-the moment trip to Chicago. We found it to be within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile and a very good rate, so we decided to go for it. Normally we can't afford a decent hotel within the city, but I guess we got lucky. When we arrived at the Avenue hotel we loved the sophisticated but not stuffy decor and we were warmly greeted with a smile and a warm welcome from the doorman, who quickly assisted us with our luggage.  Our room was very clean and well-kept. My husband thought it was a bit small, but in the city, that's to be expected.  I found it to be comfortable and pleasant.  I was excited to try the bed since it seemed that is what every other review mentioned and we were not disappointed at all!  The best darn night of sleep ever.  When staying at the Avenue Hotel you are in walking distance of some really great restaurants and shopping, no need to have a car while staying here. The hotel overall was very impressive, especially for the bargain we got it for.  All in all, I would definitely stay at the Avenue Hotel when visiting Chicago, bargain or no bargain;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

We  attended a friend's wedding in Chicago at Avenue Hotel in Chicago and decided to stay the weekend for a little holiday. I was excited to have a weekend away with my husband and our closest friends.The wedding at Avenue Hotel was simply beautiful. It seemed like everything went flawlessly. The food was quite good and I must say the service level of the staff was excellent. Everyone who works there seems happy and it reflects on how they treat guests. I am in the service business so I always notice these things and am usually quite critical.  But nothing to criticize about my Chicago stay at Avenue Hotel - my husband was shocked!We made plans ahead to fill in our time with other activities. My husband and I felt like kids again being able to explore a bit of Chicago and have a new adventure to share.  We loved the Navy Pier and riding the Ferris wheel and I loved all the shopping that was within walking distance of the hotel.  After a busy day, we wanted to enjoy a couple's massage, which we had never done before and we were thrilled to discover they would come directly to our room.  How awesome was that!  The Avenue Hotel is great and not only perfect for a wedding in Chicago but also for a relaxing weekend. The hotel has the Sky Bar which is outstanding and on the 40th floor with amazing views of the city. The rooms are comfortable yet contemporary, with a great vibe. We truly enjoyed our stay and will recommend the Avenue Hotel for our Chicago vacationing friends.;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw
2482;3/18/2009;nnAcq_YXp13nwt4-wzLwFQ;ammS2PdG_Pdi8GFtYkSgvQ;Outstanding Hotel! Our first contact with Chicago and its people was the Avenue Hotel. My girlfriends and I met in Chicago for a weekend getaway and everyone was so kind, helpful, and pleasant from the moment you entered the door.  They definitely gave one the feeling you were their main concern. We were all so hungry when we arrived and didn't really know what direction to walk. We asked the first person we saw which happened to be the Bellman, what he suggested.  Without hesitation he got us a map and highlighted a few places and sent us on our way.  We couldn't have asked for more. The hotel is beautiful. Great location for walking if you don't mind the frigid air, but it was a nice change.  Shopping, museums, restaurants, they were all so close we didn't' even need to rent a car.  However at one point the Taxi Cab did feel warm and inviting.  The rooms were very nice and comfortable with a hip, contemporary feel and awesome beds. I don't remember the last time I slept that good in a hotel. There was a lot going on at night and the Sky Lounge at the top of the hotel was a perfect way to end our evenings, what a view!  It was a happy place. We would love to return for another Girls Weekend in Chicago.  Thank you Avenue Hotel!;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

The Avenue Hotel in Chicago was one of our most pleasant stays. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel clean.  Each employee that we encountered seemed to enjoy their work and performed in top form. I believe this also reflects on the management - happy work environments create happy workers! The view from the Sky Lounge on the 40th floor is breathtaking, and we enjoyed our breakfast there each morning before venturing out for the day, even the young ones thought it was cool.  This hotel is in the heart of it all and within walking distance to great shopping, site seeing, and restaurants.  I could go on and on but you really need to see it for yourself.  If you go to Chicago stay at the Avenue Hotel!  The Jones family will definitely be back.;5;0;0;0;iIrBXLRm4Ga1AjvthhrLOw

2485;7/7/2012;XMYlAGg5RS_yU-pwJpKO-g;M0vDHXMIZbo_LTzCXOzS9g;I stayed there for two days this week and I have to say my expectations were much higher. I stay in Chicago quite often for business and pleasure, and this was my first time at the Allerton. Sure, the location was great as many point out, but there are countless other hotels in the area. A couple of blocks takes at most a few minutes to walk, and in the end, staying the night at another hotel would be much better.The hotel staff was friendly enough and my experience with them was positive. The downsides of the hotel greatly outweigh whatever positives the employees and location provide. First off, the rooms are incredibly tiny. Sure, it's the city, but I've never been in a room so small in Chicago. Secondly, my room was actually dirty. The bedsheets had sand in them when I went to sleep, and I'm guessing someone got a sandy towel stuck with the laundry that day. However, the maid should have noticed the sheets were dirty when she put them on the bed. There was also mold on the ceiling of the bathroom, something I've never seen in a hotel at this price point. Finally, I had purchased a park and play package, and never received the "play" part of the deal, which was supposed to include a welcome kit and free wi-fi. Instead, I was told I needed to purchase wi-fi, the packages starting at $10. What really was the worst part of the experience was the bed and the "valet" parking. When coming to the city, I look forward to getting a good rest on a nice mattress. The mattress at the Allerton was horrible. I've never had a problem at any hotel I've stayed at in the city. The mattresses are thin and old, so old in fact that you can feel the springs when you lay down on it! I woke up incredibly sore, from my back to my neck. I would equate the beds to something you would find at a Red Roof Inn! I did not pay almost $200/night for that. As far as the valet parking goes, avoid it at ALL costs. When I picked my car up before leaving, it took them over 30 minutes to bring me my car. I thought valet parking wasn't supposed to be a headache?! The parking allows for "come and go" access, meaning once they park you, you can come in and out of the parking garage throughout your stay. I can't imagine wasting a half hour of my time each time I wanted to leave!I wanted to like the Allerton, but I just can't. I love the decor, and it's very modern and clean. The did a great job on that end. I'm not normally picky, but for the price I was expecting much more. I normally don't complain about hotels (it might seem like it in this review), but I have never been so disappointed. Would I stay here if the price was lower? Yes. For now though, I will be staying elsewhere.;2;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2486;5/24/2012;iAtiZiLPcgymIvHSQtJV3g;PMn8sGtCP3hH3Nvoo03C6g;Nice enough - and we got a great price on Hotwire. It is a little cramped though. The elevators are small, the lobby is small, the standard rooms are small. However, it is very clean and well decorated. The room windows open all the way and don't have a screen, which is a little strange for a highrise hotel. Overall, a fine place to sleep.;3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

2489;1/25/2012;zG_NfMyINpD7zxbwByBlqw;VCAs6g1YUuFnsviI8Hn1XA;The best thing about this hotel is the LOCATION!  Another nice feature about this hotel is that it does have a little bit newer/updated décor, but it does not make it "luxury" or 4 star by any means.  The main entrance takes you to a small lobby area with some seating and a station for the bellmen, and then a hall that leads to the elevators.  The elevators are very small, but luckily we didn't have to wait too long for 1.  The check-in/reservation desk, as well as the concierge table, bar/lounge, and restaurant are located on the 2nd floor.  I never saw anyone at the concierge table -  - would have been a problem had we stayed more than 1 night. The bellman was helpful in assisting with the few questions I did have, though.  Check-in/out was fine.  We had no problem leaving our bags with the bellmen when we arrived early/before check-in or after check-out.  They were able to retrieve our bags quickly with no issues.  We had a standard king room and it was very small.  I don't mind a small room, but I was surprised by how small it the room was.  The TV was nice, there was a desk, the bed looked nice with white bedding and navy piping.  The closet was tiny, but again, we were only staying for 1 night, so not a big deal.  I think these accommodations are ok for a night or weekend, but I would have been cramped had I been staying for an extended period of time (a week or more).  I have read this before, and I will have to agree 100% that the sheets are extremely rough and scratchy!  My husband and I both commented on the low quality sheets, which was disappointing.  I think nice sheets can make such a huge difference in a hotel.  I slept well despite the scratchy sheets.  The pillows were soft and comfy.A word of warning: THE WALLS ARE VERY THIN!!!!  During the day I heard the man in the room next to us talking on his cell phone.  He was speaking with a normal tone/volume and I could hear the entire conversation very clearly, as if he was in the room.  That being said, we woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of our neighbors...!  WHOA!  They weren't even that loud, it was honestly that the walls were incredibly thin.  Eeek.The bathroom was small and had a pedestal sink, no counter space, and a more industrial looking toilet with the flush handle similar to a commercial toilet (it's an old hotel).  The shower was nice, the marble was nice, and the shower head was actually pretty good and provided decent water pressure and a rainfall spray.  The toiletries were limited and included a bar of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion.  They smelled pleasant, but I would have appreciated a shower cap and maybe a body wash.   The towels were fine, they got me dry, but they were quite standard.  I guess if you have more toiletries and more luxury towels, the price of the room would just go up, so again, it's what your priorities are, right? I think the hotel, the room, and the bathroom appeared to be clean, but not spotless.  If I had been staying for more than 1 night I would have expected more in the way of cleanliness.Overall, I would say this hotel is average - convenient location, nice , but old.   Allerton is definitely not a boutique or luxury hotel, so if that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed (note that this review is based on a standard king and I am unable to provide an opinion on any upgraded rooms they may offer). We were comfortable and didn't have any major issues or complaints.   I think just having softer, higher quality sheets could make a huge difference in the experience, though.  People don't always use the other amenities in a hotel (desk, TV, closet, etc.) but they almost always need a comfortable place to rest (with silky sheets!)  We probably won't stay here again, because there are so many other options and I'm not opposed to spending a little more for a true luxury hotel.;2;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2490;8/17/2011;l6O99lcpYKZHXt_lcAVxCw;1uRw63m39SbhvN_51kDTGg;We have had an AWFUL experience at this hotel. Before booking, we were told that the Allerton Hotel lists itself as a "business" hotel with strong wi fi capabilities. This was extremely important to us when booking as we run a company that relies on the ability to upload time sensitive large files while traveling. Upon first arrival, when we realized that the advertised wi fi speed was far below the ACTUAL wi fi speed, we spoke with a manager who gave us the run around, finally transferring us to the internet service provider outside of the hotel. After hours of waiting (and losing precious time), we had gotten nowhere and had to resort to looking into other options with no help from the hotel. Finally, we ran tests via http://testmy.net and were surprised to find that the connection was running 98% LOWER than the average internet connection speed. The hotel staff was clueless, the internet provider couldn't reset the server because their system was FROZEN, and our business trip was RUINED. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU NEED TO USE THE INTERNET. ALSO, there was a PILE of dust in the corner of the room near the television - clearly the staff thinks what you don't see at first glance does not need to be cleaned. We tried to plug in the lamp (which did not work) and saw that the floor in that corner was white with dust. Gross.Totally not a 4 star hotel as advertised on Hotwire and the rooms were smaller than any place we've stayed even in NYC or Rome. And parking is $50 a night. Way overpriced.The ONLY thing it has going for it is location. Location is amazing. But PLEASE don't stay here if you need to conduct any sort of real business! Or if you have a traveling companion (rooms only big enough for one person).;1;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2491;7/26/2011;G07WzptU-gaa-wEK8zqg4w;FD-sNhPD2pbUMzZ3uyHt-g;WON'T BE BACK!Booked this special trip through Priceline and it turned into a very bad joke! When we got to our room we opened the door to what we believed to be a closet, we could barely turn ourselves around in it. Our great view was all of the boilers and air conditioner equipment. Internet connection was barely there "that is if you could even stay connected". I'm wondering where the rooms we see in the pictures for this hotel are because what they try to sell you in the picture is not what you get when you check in. So much for thinking this was going to be a special place to stay. Just my experience people but stay away from room 511.;2;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2492;5/23/2008;DVVjPAxipVNbYNg2TBIRhQ;NZsdxzjFepRypRbqQZuEdw;We attended a wedding here & it was FUN & really memorable because of the uniqueness of this old hotel!  I'll agree with the previous post that the low ceiling between the north & south sides of the top floor ball room can make it feel small, but it really is a special place. If you stay there you need to keep in mind that it was built in the 1920s or so & is a HISTORIC part of Chicago's history. It is not a modern Marriott so if you need this to be happy, then do not stay at The Allerton!Here's what I'll say about the wedding I went to. They give you a lot of space between the hall where the elevators let you out & then there was an extra room for the cocktail hour so that was nice. Lighting should have been  dimmer to support the romantic ambiance of a wedding, but some of the older guests probably appreciated the bright lights.Food was good, staff was fun and upbeat, & we had a great ole time in the bar downstairs before we went up to the reception at 630. Nice surprise to have another bar waiting for us once we got out of the elevator for the reception line with the wedding party! Yee haw!Do not stay here if you're an impatient, type-A person. They have a small reception desk but the staff was really nice. We saw one business guy almost blow a gasket while he was waiting in a long line to check out though!If you're wanting your wedding there like the previous post, just know that it's an old historic hotel and the bar has to be outside the ballroom due to space, but if your guests want a drink, they'll find the bar! I'm a good friend of the bride's  & the organizing of her reception was probably a little more stressful than it should have been for the amount of money they spent!  Sound system needs some improvement too, but city views out the windows were SPECTACULAR, and it's really the guests made the reception a great one.I'd stay there again.Oh, my husband said to write that he liked the butter in the restaunt. Waiter & busboy were exceptionally attentive. Hubby thought  steak was a little small but he's a bit of a glutton so take that with a grain of salt.!;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2493;3/14/2011;kBjqSR4La2HEgTKv5j9_Kw;HJeLKwv-J6qJ8hJWKNlusQ;What a relief...I came upon this sight and started reading the reviews the day before we were set to check in. I started to think I made a big mistake. Well, I am pleased to say that not only did I NOT make a mistake, I couldn't have been HAPPIER with my decision. My daughter and I had a small suite with a king bed. Yes, these rooms are a bit smaller but really people...this is an old hotel! The room was neat and clean and due to the fact that we were staying a week I was able to request a small fridge to keep snacks and drinks. The front desk staff was polite and on point, check in was a snap and requests were fulfilled promptly. I decided to try room service for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised...the food was great and well worth the price for the quantity. The last two nights of our stay my husband showed up to surprise my daughter and we were even able to get a roll-away bed for her. We didn't even notice that is was there since it fit right into the sitting area of our suite. Each time we went out and needed travel assistance the guys downstairs were more then willing to give directions, recommendations and then ensure that we had a cab right away. A BIG thank you goes to each and everyone of you who made my daughters stay ( I say that because all of her friends were at a different hotel for the National Honor Choir) in Chicago everything she could have wished for and more. She loved telling everyone that she was staying at the Allerton and that they should have too!;5;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2494;3/4/2011;VRKGWB7l9u-T3DYIry3HCg;FEHIKMiw6k0xyjgc7z-VRg;I was planning to stay at The James and instead opted for this property after coming across a cheap rate at http://www.getaroom.com. My only gripes: my room was small and the service was a little slow. The food we bought at the restaurant didn't disappoint! I didn't have a chance to use the gym (too busy checking out the shops along Magnificent Mile), but my cousin said it was worth checking out. This is by no means a luxury hotel, so cross this one off the list if that's what you're after.;3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2495;9/6/2010;qWwA4s6YvxnQ-oJZIPYWkA;CuJQax-eY4XkCVLtAVzDMw;Can't beat the location of this Hotel.  Our room was very spacious (King) and had a great view of N Michicgan Avenue, the Water Tower, etc.  We did happen to score a room on the 22nd floor.  I don't know how anyone else encountered issues with this hotel, from the other reviews.  The flat screen TV had Cable TV (of course, if you know how to work a remote, it was very easy to navigate through the menu and screen and cable channels.  It was a holiday weekend, a fully booked hotel, and a very large wedding party was staying at the hotel. No issues with chekc-in, service, front desk or TV. Staff was respectful and helpful when needed.   Checking bags after check-out and the car valet service were each very convenient.  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend some time on the Magnificent Mile.  Only gripe:  no complimentary WiFi service in the hotel rooms.;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2496;12/9/2009;scPfjWOS_opk7VDgDDf8Kw;SvAp-J2zuVah_TGGRzseXQ;I stayed here earlier this year while on business. I'll start with the pros: The hotel enjoys a great location on Michigan Avenue, near several restaurants, shops and other points of interest. I also had no problem with the service. However, the hotel shares a flaw with many of the hotels in which I've stayed in Chicago, San Francisco and other cities: size. The rooms looked a lot bigger on http://www.getaroom.com, and the lobby itself seemed rather small. Also, the elevators (these were small too) were beyond confusing. You have to go up to the 3rd floor to then get on another elevator? I've never seen that before. The hotel isn't perfect, but you get what you pay for. You'll still have a comfortable stay at a reasonable price.;3;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q

2498;1/17/2009;tKL-kTorM3EaVP8qLPziaQ;HxIIcvKTzSzXTuEpK4spYg;Beautiful renovation on this historic hotel. The lobby is something akin to a W hotel decorated in white and the staff has been incredibly warm and welcoming (even when I arrived at 8am wondering if I could have an early check-in). Rooms have a nod to old-hollywood with whites and creams, crystal and black accents yet retain a modern edge.Some things you need to know:1. The restaurant doesn't serve dinner, but you can get small snacks in the bar until 112. Room service stops at 11 (not so good for night owls like me)3. Free wi-fi in the bar, restaurant and lobby but $10 a day in your room4. No mini-bar in roomMy room was really, really tiny. Boston boutique hotel tiny... but stylish and comfy bed. The bathroom left quite a bit to be desired from the lighting and motel-8 quality towels to the icy marble walls, floor and shower. The best thing about the bathroom are the L'Occtaine products they provide.I did have appetizers and wine in the bar, all were extraordinary. The menu is ambitious and creative and completely delivers. Surveying other plates around me I could see lots of tempting choices! Staff in the bar/lounge were exceptional.Location is excellent for shopping mag mile - it's next door to Neiman Marcus, across the street from Saks and about half way between Macy's @ Watertower Place and Nordstrom.My job is all travel, so I spend many, many nights in hotels. This is a good value for the location and general ambiance. Not high-end luxury, but not budget either. Could work for travel or a fun getaway. Interesting bar to meet coworkers or friends for a drink,  charming restaurant to meet a client for breakfast or coffee:both will leave others with the impression that you know your stuff!I'll definitely stay here again.;4;0;0;0;DxfjGOEtFJQoq6m8WjYl4Q
2499;7/9/2012;-aVzDURzmP7JAo0VMz-Abg;NsjQ5kwq6qF3tbZq_dxHzg;Just completed a big family reunion at this property. We had a luncheon buffet and a dinner buffet, and all of the food was excellent. The pastries are to die for. The new restaurant, which opened about two months ago has a more extensive menu than the prior. The hotel staff was attentive to every need. Rooms are small, and the bathrooms are the smallest I have seen, but when you consider you are right next to a 5 star hotel and you are paying hundreds of dollars less,  the Chicago Essex Inn will be my first choice whenever I return to Chicago. All rooms are nicely appointed, and if you can afford the upgrade to the King Suite, you will not be disappointed by the space and the view. We experienced very hot temperatures (100 degrees) on one of the days, and the A/C in the banquet hall facing the east, just could not keep up. Fans were required, which were offered. The lobby is clean and neatly appointed, and I understand it will undergo renovation after the current tourist summer season. A best kept secret is the 4th floor open air garden patio with excellent view up and down Michigan Avenue and the lakefront. The pool and weight room will satisfy almost anybody. Cabs are easy to get, and many tourist buses stop right in front of the hotel.;4;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ
2500;4/7/2012;EcmMAI7UOh6NPIck_uKliw;jsclPqUv8xpHp5Wrayl92Q;Stayed here for 2 nights in April 2012. The rooms are clean, but small, all of the employees go out of their way to help, but the hotel itself leaves alot to be desired, at 129.00 per night, I expect the A/C to work, the room was 80 degrees all nite long, and didnt cool off till about 5 am, even with the window open. The pop machines didnt work on 12 of the floors. We booked a room for 4 and the room had only 3 towels, the pool was closed more than it was open, and if the pool is closed the smoking area is closed as well, which doesnt make sense to anyone with an IQ over 10, so people only smoke when the pools are open? This was a 50.00 a night hotel at best, matter of fact, most 50 dollar a night hotels have A/C that works.;2;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

We stayed here because of the pool for the kids.The pool is filthy, has RUST & BROWN SCUM all over the edges and ladders and needs cleaning.The atrium smells. The continental breakfast is a joke-with vendor machine type muffins in plastic wrap. No restaurant either. No beverage or snack bar. No movies available on tv either. Pillows are more like a rock hard basketballs. The bathroom was the smallest bathroom I have ever used in a hotel and almost impossible to get an adult and child in there without getting banged by the door.The garage attendants damaged our car and they gave us the runaround for 2 days before we were able to file the report.I called at noon and asked why our room was not cleaned and was informed that this was not a regular hotel with hotel rules----it was the "Essex Inn" and was rudely informed that the room would be cleaned by 4PM. The hotel manager is never available.Poor attitude and poor management is the norm for this hotel.Save your hard earned money and stay elsewhere!;1;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

I also did not have maid service every day, and not by choice.   This place was also way overpriced.;1;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

Down one block west on S. Holden Street were 2 other parking areas one on the right hand side was outdoors unattended lot for $16 for 24 hours (we chose this one and our car was fine.

Room was decent and clean. Everyone who worked there went out of that extra mile to be as rude as possible. The shuttle they advertise wasn't running almost the entire time we were there and they were absolutely unapologetic about it. Also there was a  #$%^&%^&  jackhammer running directly over our heads at ten in the morning which would have been nice to know about before we made our reservations. But, if it's the best deal in town for the location I would think of staying there again.;2;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

NO fax. NO copier. If you wanted anything faxed or copied you had to ask at the front desk and although the staff was reasonably accommodating about it. It was a PAIN. Talk about false advertising. This is the exact quote from their website:"Our business center is equipped with all the comforts of your office - computer workstations, high-speed Internet access, printers, fax machines, copiers, and supplies - and plenty of quiet workspace. It's conveniently located on the first floor and is open 24 hours a day."Straight. Up. Lie.;2;0;0;0;uy2bscWexAcIhOQJ_rn3cQ

Got a great rate on the room. The rockstar theme isn't my forte but I knew what I was getting into and they do it well. Overnight parking is a little pricey at $46/night but I needed to put my car somewhere, and they have valet so you can just drop your car at the door. Little did I know the REAL reason we went to chicago... While we were out at dinner/drinks at the Hancock building, my bf had talked to Jose at the front desk and when we returned to the room he had arranged champagne/candles/chocolate and strawberries for us. My boyfriend proposed in this lovely setting. Since we hadn't arranged the 'romance package' beforehand we didn't get the rose petals. Jose felt so bad about the missing rose petals that he didn't charge us at all for the rest of it! (We left him a good tip anyway...)The room was good size and very comfy. The bed was incredibly comfortable even though I was too busy planning in my head my upcoming wedding to get much sleep. Great view of Michigan Ave from the 20th floor (could even see the river!)Would stay here again in a heartbeat...;5;0;0;0;lDVAVEPaVSqHzJ2a43_IMA

2519;11/23/2011;hCaqFNSOUlgoeM7GDvtRnw;pq1C362bZn66mwLgRUkDzA;Normally I'm not a fan of places with über-trendy, über-clubby vibes, but I have a soft spot for the W Lakeshore. I've stayed here a few times in the past few years and each time I've been impressed. I've even been impressed when I wasn't a guest here. Everyone-- from the doormen to the front desk to the cleaning ladies to the fitness room attendants to the concierge-- have been always been accommodating and professional.  It was here where I first learned what concierges did. I used to walk by hotel concierges and wonder what the heck they did all day. At the W Lakeshore, they do everything! They make rental car reservations if you want to drive out to the 'burbs, mail letters even if you don't have a stamp, reserve tables at popular restaurants--the whole shebang! Once I wandered into the W when I wasn't staying there, all lost and wind-shocked, and the concierge looked up the restaurant I was trying to get to and gave me directions. Now that's service.  The rooms are a little on the small side, but the view of the lake more than makes up for it. At a lot of hotels with supposed lake views, you can only see the lake way, way off in the distance. At the W, however, you can take a shower, open the divider between the bathroom and bedroom, and all you see is water when you look out the window. Now that's priceless. As a much-appreciated security precaution, you have to insert your room card to use the elevators. The hotel exercise room has nice equipment, but I usually just run along the lakeshore path because it's right across the street. The complimentary Bliss products are a little too citrusy-smelling for my liking, but that's just a preference thing. I can't comment on the restaurant or bars because I've never tried them, but the bar/lounge/restaurant area on the first floor is full of people in stylish clothes at night so I'm assuming it'd be a good place to pick up people if that's your thing. Tip: If you're part of the Starwood Preferred Guest program, you get early check-in and late check-out (4PM!!!!), even if you didn't book the room through the Starwood website. Also, most hotel programs don't give you reward points if book through an outside party, but I've gotten about 50-60 SPG points per stay in the past (which, admittedly, is basically nothing but still appreciated).;5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

I ordered food to eat in the hotel and I was absolutely disenchanted. Food was not only tasteless but it was hard to swollow. Good thing is that hotel reimbursed me for that- Lobby bar. This lobby bar in the top floor is just not like the W hotel lobby bars that you would expect. This one is tasteless and reminds of bars that are almost out of business. I don't expect anyone to like to go there to celebrate anything or even for a drinkBut, all in all, is a worthwhile experience if you plan to come to Chicago for a good time!;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ

CHECK-IN: was a breeze...although had problem con my room keys at first, but problem easily resolved with the friendly concierge. It is a small hotel and the BLISS SPA is nice too (of course pri$ey) but I have been to way better spas in other hotels. So save your dinero!!! The bar located on the main floor is also filled with an upscale trendy crowd Now the part you should really care about...dun dun dun.... ROOM: very modern, beautiful, small, amazing view (request Lakeshore) but very comfortable...you will def have a great nite's rest....plushy very soft beds and pillows and Gorgeous marble bathroom filled with the hotel spa products "Bliss" with open french windows....You can see in your bathroom from your room or vice versa (weird but a nice touch).

She performed extensive relocation of the furniture to ensure the "flow" of the room.  Sarah outreached to our incoming out-of-town guests and made sure they were educated on hotel  amenities.  W-Hotel also provided referrals for a nanny or evening sitter for our esteemed nephew-Mathew.  My cousin Sandra is a new mom and this was a concern for the family.  The service was wonderful on all aspects and we had a great time. Thank you to all the staff and especially Sarah Petermann.Michael & Janette  "MJdragonfly";5;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
2526;6/8/2008;TqfGO-c5Huyfqr0NDm_ERQ;VTBzce3K3xjxleQEa-BLKA;I'm not really into the W-thing.  I've stayed in some W's in the past that didn't pass muster, so I wasn't expecting much and ended up being pleasantly surprised.  I prefer classy older hotels over urban hip establishments.  But, having said that, I actually enjoyed my recent stay here while attending a medical convention.  Overall, this hotel suited my needs as a business traveller.  I was greeted very warmly by the receptionist upon check in .  The lobby was contemporary/ minimalist, but beautifully decorated with flowers and candles that made a good first impression.  I found my room to be pretty standard business class, but the bed was extremely comfortable with thick down pillows and eqyptian cotton sheets.  The room had a full mini-bar, an LG flat screen TV, DVD player (hotel had a nice video library that I did not sample), an IPod docking station, nice bath robe, bliss bath toilettries, and 24-hr room service.  As a single traveller, I did not mind the window with shutters that opened to the bedroom from the bath.  I actually liked to have the shutters open so that I could watch TV from the bathroom while brushing my teeth in the morning.   The elevator ride down to the lobby was usually awkward in the morning, as strangers in business attire crammed in next to me in this dimly lit minidisco with piped in sexy disco musak. The entire lobby turned into a night club on most evenings during my stay.  It was a lively scene, and I found that my colleagues were all eager to participate.  We tried the restaurant "Wave" for lunch and dinner and I would highly recommend it.  I sampled many of the dishes from the tapas-style menu and they were excellent, including hummus, spinach and feta pastries, flank steak, and octopus.    The hotel is conveniently located a few short blocks from Michigan ave with it's fantastic shops and restaurants.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would probably stay here again.;4;0;0;0;YfzsjiJl3m-Yza64aIL7SQ
2527;8/29/2012;zJ22s5plFbKYZUzZDL3UrA;AIgOi1cGNmEpMB8rP-Ad4Q;I double booked a room for this hotel, my mistake due to misunderstanding of not accepting their offer of an "upgrade" on internet. I realized the mistake immediately after booking and seeing two confirmations to my e-mail. I called customer service and was told it would not be a problem to cancel the first reservation, but it would be 4-6 weeks to process refund.  I booked several weeks out and figured they would take care of it. My family and I went to check in, they said I had two rooms, I explained situation and that I did not need two rooms, they said OK they would take care of it. Again thought it would be taken care of. Two months later no refund, I called customer service and was given the runaround, representative eventually agreed to review my initial calls with supervisor the next day and get back to me. Didn't happen. I posted on Embassy's Facebook, basically the same response and lack of action/communication. Think twice before dealing with this group.;1;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
2528;7/25/2012;3pA_DKJfKbNWskPpIM6DKA;XCJ7J2i0vpjQcpKbA1vpiA;We were not able to check in until nearly 4 pm but they held our bags to allow us to wander around before check in time.  This place is very family friendly, which means there were a lot of young children running around and splashing in the pool until late in the evening.  Unfortunately, we were looking for a quiet place to stay and this was not it.  Our room door was on the atrium and our window was on the street so we either heard the screams of young children in the pool or sirens, car, and pedestrian noise from the street the entire time we were there.  In fact, I rarely got any sleep from all the street noise. The floor was very dirty and had some stains on it.  The Wi-Fi, which you have to pay for only worked about 25% of the time.  And their tech support was no help for that.  On the plus side, while the bathroom is snug the shower pressure was awesome.  The king size bed was comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. There was an evening manager's reception with a free drink and snacks (chips and veggies).  And the breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room.  The drawback to that was if you did not go first thing, the breakfast area was overrun with mobs of young families. This place is only about three or four blocks off Michigan Avenue, which is great if you're looking for a place close to the Magnificent Mile.  There are tons of restaurants around within walking distance.  And there's a Trader Joe's a few blocks away.  Not sure I'd return due to the noisy room and so many young families.;3;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
2529;5/6/2012;etaIG7f8RrIfHXlLydwlFA;ueBVlDmQ5XyOIeCLeZ1vmA;Stayed here in May 2012. Room was lovely, modern, comfortable, nicely decorated, clean,  large, quiet and easy to find. Which is saying quite a bit, actually.However, front desk personnel were an unwelcoming committee. They didn't smile, didn't welcome us as HiltonHHonors members,  didn't tell us about the reception or breakfast or actually, anything. They weren't outright mean or straight-up rude, but were somewhere between surly and sullen. I would've written it off as one person having a bad day, but two different people checked us in (one a pre-check-in when we dropped off luggage, and one after official check-in time).  I stay fairly regularly in other HIlton chain hotels, and have always been pleased with the attitude and service. Wi-fi was a pain and required multiple tries, calls to the front desk and finally, IT support, to get it connected.;3;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

2535;6/10/2011;BSk4ip_kZ4S-Z2xKDnciXA;zrIBsl71pJKUzZkRe45_VA;My family and I stayed at the Embassy Downtown for a mini-vaca and we were glad we chose this hotel. I contacted the concierge before arrival to let them know we would be arriving early and to verify that we could store our luggage before we checked in to the room. To my surprise, our room was available upon arrival because of my earlier inquiry. The hotel is located a short walk from the Michigan Ave and State Street shopping districts and is right next to a grocery store that provides any toiletries you may have forgotten. The staff greeted us throughout our stay and were quite helpful navigating the streets. The free breakfast helped us keep our costs down and had many options from muffins to made to order omelets. We swam in the pool a few times and although it is small, it is perfect for young kids and doing laps. The bed was really comfortable and the suite gave us room to spread out and enjoy ourselves. We'll definitely return to the Embassy in the future.;5;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
2536;10/13/2010;qb0zlnQuiFXFRSs-BX-rXg;Ygfua8XMGigiW1UAox2HjQ;I'm comparing this hotel to the Embassy Suites Chicago Lakefront at 511 North Columbus, Chicago, IL, the Embassy Suites at Washington Square in Beaverton, OR, and my prior experiences with Hilton resort properties.I stayed there with my wife and our 2 y.o. infant for 3 nights in October 2010.The Good: The staff was very, very friendly and helpful.  I had to take a breakfast tray back to my room while managing an infant, and a staffperson offered to help me without me having to ask her.The location is also very convenient as it's located in the heart of the River North district.  A Jewel/Osco is across the street.The Bad:The rooms are outdated.  The walls are thin.  The bathroom smelled funny.  The carpet was musky.  The sleeper sofa was outdated.  And the curtains don't blocked out enough light.The breakfast buffet was very poor.  The scrambled eggs were rubbery (even when they served a new batch.)  The fresh cantaloupe and honeydew tasted stale.  The omelets used frozen spinach and not fresh. They did not rotate their offerings.Summary:I will never stay here again.  It was not worth the money to me to stay in a sub-par room and be served a sub-par breakfast.  In the future, I will either spend the same money on a better room and buy breakfast separately.;1;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA

2540;8/4/2009;AxdZfvZspV-X40Bnd_SJow;Es37vXz6fPrMtDQMB7xN2g;My family and I booked into this hotel for our weeklong trip to Chicago. We are being charged $200 a night for the five of us, but I am  not impressed. I was told that there was WiFi available, but not informed that it was an additional $10 per device per day to use. The free computer terminals, which I am  using to write this review, have three computers and are quite busy most of the day.The Suite my family checked into was slightly cramped, and I had very little room. This hotel advertises as a "family-friendly hotel", and I guess that is who this is for, couples with small children and single businessmen. I shall not be returning here, and I would rreccomend the Embassy Suites on the Navy Pier, I have found it much cheaper.;2;0;0;0;YIfXuMhZgZf3xNnRWjyDYA
2541;4/17/2012;Nr2AA25D6ziTjn7apUOQwA;7Nb-POL9XZCbboAzBu5Qvw;I am not a frequent yelper but was so impressed by this hotel that I felt like I needed to share my experience. I stayed at the James on Monday of this week and after a long day at the office, I really appreciated the friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. Check-in was a breeze and they even gave me an upgrade to a suite.  My suite was exactly what I was looking for, large king size bed with flatscreen in the bedroom, moderately sized living room with a coffee table, couuch and large TV. It was great for finishing up some work at night in a more relaxing environment. Wifi was free, they offer a nice high-tech "Dream Machine" alarm clock with audio like rain and beach sounds to put you to sleep + an ipod deck in the mini kitchen. I checked out their GYM and was really impressed to see the sheer size and number of machines and equiptment, also opened 24 hours. Their bath products were all natural and high-quality (can't recall the name) and the shower was very clean, which I have noticed is NOT standard at many pretty high-end hotels. I woke up refereshed and headed out for the day. The last experience that sealed the deal on this hotel moving to my top 5 was the helpful bell-boy that gave me directions to the Starbucks down the street, offered to hold my bags while I went and had my bags in a cab waiting for me when I got back. It's the extra committment to service that makes the James Hotel special in my mind. I've got 50/50 luck on finding great hotels that actually make you feel at home when traveling for business so this hotel ranks well above some of the more popular hotels in this part of Chicago. Kudos to the James, you seem to "get it" when it comes to service and you've got really fantastic people on your team!;5;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

Everyone from the doorman to the receptionists seem to be very genuine. Most of my experience is with their banquet facility on the 2nd floor. It is a very nice space.

2543;7/20/2011;dzMz8IcKKukXAAst57IY0w;KKiPiPxZyJi6eNUEPKAjdA;I used to live in the city, now the burbs, but have to stay overnight in the city sometimes for business. I recently stayed in a standard king room at the James, at a rate of $170. Pros: - Great location for shopping and restaurants/food. You're within easy walking distance to the Oak Street area as well as regular Magnificent Mile shopping. Plus a short walk to the river. David Burke is the hotel restaurant, Grahamwich is around the corner, and across the street are Trader Joe's, Starbucks, and a gourmetish deli.- Overall decor is fresh, modern, clean.- Quiet rooms.- Friendly staff- Parking is expensive but if you go north just a couple of blocks on Rush there's $30/day parking (however it is not easy in/out).Cons:- At 3 pm my room wasn't ready and the staff person tried to upsell me another room at a higher rate. On the plus side, they took my number and called me when the room was ready.- The carpet in the room is odd: it has a higher pile than you see in most hotel rooms, and it's brown, so it appears to be dirty and dingy.- The bathroom was small but easy, modern and convenient. Kiehl's soaps and lotions. The bathroom lacked a fan (or else it was so oddly placed that it couldn't be found), which meant that there was a slightly damp or dank smell to the room. Not a huge deal by any means, but something I noticed.- This one is kind of weird but there's a huge, fluorescent light fixture directly above the bed, placed right above where one's head rests on the pillows. I thought this was so strange! It kind of made me paranoid that the fixture would fall on me. Not that it looked loose or anything. Just the placement - right over the head - was a little unnerving. Your own paranoia may vary.Finally, be aware that the hotel is not completely non-smoking:a few of the floors are for smokers. As a non-smoker, I did not detect the smell of smoke anywhere.Of course every hotel has its quirks and overall I'd definitely stay at the James again.;4;0;0;0;DC1sD5TsqljP_BIAV6S-pw

When I first arrived there with friends the place wasn't too crowded. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was trying to walk on the very uneven/holey/sticky floors. If you require women to wear heels you should at least have a floor to accommodate that ridiculous rule. There are supposed to be no gym shoes/boots/white t-shirts but most of the people who came after 11pm had on all of the above. Vale was 20$ which isn't bad I suppose but I've definitely had cheaper. To use your card it was a minimum of $25 which I think is completely fucking absurd. The DJ wasn't that awesome at all, played a lot of old music and played the same song maybe three times in the same hour. Once the club was packed they jacked the entrance prices up to 20$ for ladies and 35$ for men, there is no room to navigate, and it's hard to breathe in the stuffy environment. If you paid for bottle service you got let in faster. All in all, there are better places to go for a good time in Chicago.

It's a crappy-looking club in a lousy location where they make you pay $20 for valet before making you wait in line to enter. As you're entering, they frisk the guys and check the girls' purses. You are then FORCED to pay $4 to check your coat. If you are with other people, you cannot check your coats together. You MUST PAY separately! The cover that night was $20 for women and $30 for men..really? Someone said that someone from Basketball Wives L.A. was supposed to be there and this was the reason for the extra security. Who cares? I'm not impressed with celebrities and I care even less for pseudo celebrities!The club is small, dark and the music is EXTREMELY LOUD. On Saturday, the DJ played an uninspired playlist of "crap rap" music. The crowd was aggressive and "low end!" We had a room in the back where we could barely see one another and conversations were limited since you had to scream just to be minimally heard. Again, this place SUCKS!

We went here on March 13 to see J*Davey. The doors opened at 9. We were forced to listen to some crappy, unannounced opening act that took the stage sometime after 11. By 1:15 AM, I'm asking the bar staff when they headliner is going to make an appearance. They tell me the band already played. So I had to let the staff know that J*Davey was the main attraction. They said they didn't know a thing about it and had nothing to do with it.At 1:20 a fight breaks out. There's only so much time you can keep people drinking and standing and waiting before things get unruly. Once that fire is put out, only THEN does J*Davey take the stage. Only to play for about 20 minutes, until the house lights come on and it's time to go. I think they got to perform about six songs. The night was a complete rip off. Someone must have gotten a pretty decent cut of the bar revenue that night given how long the crowd was were kept waiting. I understand Privileged Media was the promoter for this event and I blame them for things getting out of hand.

Beautiful chandeliers, murals on the ceilings, etc. However, I was not very impressed with our room. We paid $250 a night for 2 beds and 2 bathrooms. The beds were doubles (not queens). It was nice having 2 bathrooms. There were two major disappointments with the room. First, there was no mini fridge. I don't think I've ever stayed in a room without one. Second of all, there was one vent for the air conditioning to come in, and it wasn't very effective. We tried turning the air down to cool off the room, and the coolest setting it would go to was 64 degrees. But the room never cooled off below like 76. We were extremely hot!I have stayed in Hiltons in other cities, and I have never been disappointed....until now.;2;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Yeah, there's noise. you're in Chicago, not Ames Iowa.I'm not sure about charging $250/night...not worth that much, but Hotwire really pulls through with the best deals.Conclusion: If you like older hotels with some character/charm, then this Hotel on Michigan Avenue will satisfy that indulgence.;4;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w
2560;4/23/2012;XidoOgA7PRZZG8rnKlgBmg;S24yox_e9kIJOnnT2_mQ2g;BEWARE BEWARE this hotel charges for everything!! Internet, fitness center, parking and badge storage. Not only do they charge you but the fees are out of control. After paying $1700 for a four night stay I had to pay $45 a night for parking $16 a day for Internet, $15 a day for the fitness center this is completely out of control. Oh but the wifi is offered for free in the lobby but really when staying on the 18th floor and going up and down to do work is ridiculous. I could understand if the hotel nightly rate was cheaper to charge all these additional fees but it's not. The trump hotel and the W has the same rates and provide Internet and fitness center FREE to its guest and their location is far better placed than the Hilton. I stayed at the Hilton for a conference but next time I will stay someplace else and take a taxi to the conference. Also The Hilton is about a forty five minute walk to all the good shopping and dining so if your not a walker you will be paying about $20 bucks a day for a round trip taxis ride.;1;0;0;0;mLdvQGAFadIJkOlEoHsI7w

Beds are soft, tv has a great picture. Only thing is the sink area, at least in our room, was tiny. Had no extra room to lay out my makeup. But no big deal. We completely enjoyed our stay.

2574;1/4/2010;yjl1nL_-XivHzl8dK59YFA;i9F_NcBSS-sJ0C3Gv65hgg;We have stayed at various Marriotts across the country, which is part of the reason we selected this hotel. The location was good, and with the supposed floor to ceiling windows that opened for a fabulous city view, we thought it would be a great spot.1. The windows are not floor to ceiling as advertised, and they only open about 3 inches. We really had no city view at all, since the inside of the windows were iced over for almost our entire stay. I live in the Midwest where it gets quite cold, but my windows never ice on the inside...2. As a result of this ice issue, the room was FREEZING. I am a person who sleeps in shorts and a tank top in the middle of Nebraska winters with the fan on. In this room, I was in pants, long sleeves, buried under the covers, and still freezing cold. All this while the heater was set on 77 degrees. 3. You'll realize how ridiculous 77 degrees is when you realize the room is tiny. I've stayed in Super 8s with bigger rooms. I must say, they take flattering photos for their advertisements! The room really was way too small. The restroom was tiny. Thank goodness I am a small person, because I don't know how anyone too much bigger could even get in the room enough to shut the door. 4. Our "city view" was none other than a view of a busy road and some crappy roofs. We could not see the skyline from our room. So how they can sell this view for an extra price is beyond me. 5. Not all of our TV channels worked. This created a problem since it was bowl week, and the channels that didn't work were channels showing games. The staff could not have cared less, and never offered any help other than suggesting we "go to the bar" to watch the games. Coincidence? 6. 24 hours of internet service is 15 bucks. We were charged for 2 days even though we only used one. To make matters more irritating, the Marriott homepage somehow became all 12 of my "favorites" on my Mac. Even when I got home and cleared my history, it continued to pop up. I don't know if they installed some kind of cookies or what, but they messed up my computer. It was a mess getting it set back the way it was.7. Leaving was a mess. We called the front desk and ask if they had a booking/reservation process for guests that needed to retrieve their vehicles from valet. They said no, and that it would only take 10 minutes. Yeah, right. We waited almost 45 minutes to get our car back.  So, unless you're leaving at 7 am, plan for it to take forever to get your vehicle upon checking out. I would not stay at the location again. Its location may be "convenient" but it's little else. I could have stayed at a different hotel, taken cabs everywhere, and still spent less than $700 for 3 nights.;2;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Location!The rooms are older and rather small, but the beds (and bedding) more than make up for it.   I LOVE their down comforters and the convenience of having your own safe (and in room coffee makers).  The lobby/lounge area is the hotel's best feature.  Many comfortable sofas and chairs, to catch up on your e-mail or have a specialty coffee (or cocktails and lite snacks).  The 4th floor offers a lounge area, that still allowed smoking (on my last visit in early March). You can easily walk to most of the city's main attractions from this hotel.   Which is why it's one of my top choices when coming back "home" to visit.{--- Chicago native, currently "exiled" in Nebraska :);4;0;0;0;mgvWzZBNNHtVP5Xd5Mz39A

Hotwire had it listed as 4-4.5 stars and while it looks fancy in the lobby and from the outside, the rooms are anything but. The beds are full-size AT BEST, lighting is terrible, and the fridge/mini bar situation is a nightmare. I was afraid to touch anything because I thought I'd be charged. Everything is on a sensor and you are charged immediately if something is moved. I've been in hotels that charge by weight or after 30 seconds or so, but never immediately. We were in a non-smoking room yet our room somehow still smelled like smoke and it was disgusting. And there is only ice on the 7th floor, with no ice buckets provided. Also, I went to use the fitness center and there is a CHARGE?! Never in my life have I ever experience that. Instead I ran down and around Navy Pier which was only 4 blocks away for free.

Not only were we greeted with the nicest staff, but one in particular, named Emily at the front desk, really enabled my boyfriend and I to have a wonderful stay. Another staff member who made the experience so delightful was Patrick, one of the guest service men. Not only did we use a groupon to get a basic room, but it being my birthday engaged them to upgrade us to the Historic Tower (which is recommended far more than the North Tower, which is the basic tower), but they also gave us the bigger corner room which allowed us more room and a comfortable space during our stay. When we arrived, they provided us with cheesecake wishing me a happy birthday, and were on call to our every need. They took care of specific requests in a timely manner and truly made our experience excepetional. One thing I feel could have been better explained is that the gym is an additional charge. This wasn't explained to us in the beginning which takes a star away because of the misinformation that we weren't provided. The gym could also use enhancements. For the kind of hotel it is, I would expect a nicer gym area. However, the food was fantastic in the dining room, and the ambience and hotel itself is clean and nicely set.

The view is spectacular, our head table was decorated beautifully, the food tasted great, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure our guests were pleased! Our wedding cake from Alliance Bakery (which is included in your wedding package) came out exactly how we envisioned it, and it was the best tasting cake I have ever had. Our bridal suite had an amazing view and it was huge! Our entire night at the Holiday Inn was perfect and I would highly recommend meeting with Barbara Martin if you are planning a wedding or event in the Chicagoland area!;5;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
2592;7/12/2010;ygJXI-VDtDLy-kQ5xdaAIA;vdWu5-z6T8l_vwBNJvSzbQ;We just had our wedding here (Friday, June 18) and we - and all of our guests - loved it! We're still hearing compliments from guests on the food (steak and chicken napoleon with duchess potatoes and steamed vegetables), the cake (the hotel connects you with Alliance Bakery, which does a fabulous job), the amazing views, the nice guest rooms and the excellent service all around. Barbara Martin is an outstanding wedding coordinator - she's organized, knows how to handle brides (and mothers of brides) with ease and she is always happy to provide suggestions, recommendations or advice to help with the wedding planning process. This was the perfect place for a Chicago wedding - you can't beat the city skyline and the river as seen from the windows in the Wolf Point Ballroom! My husband and I highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza to anyone looking for a beautiful, service-oriented venue for their wedding or special event.;5;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
2593;3/16/2010;u2QfgTaqguQE5DGYmqd1uA;Yau6Exp8r7ubuc-HRvaM0Q;The room was ok and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (20th floor). But a little dated. The wireless internet didn't work at all. Service at the front desk was cool. I also enjoyed  the Skyline Bar. I like the complementary buffet. Parking was pricey but so is the rest of Downtown Chicago.A few complaints -- the "Business Center" was horrible and charge per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. Also wanted you to swipe your credit card for a $40.00 hold that was unrealistic;3;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA
2594;8/7/2007;d3VDubAePPHY8MsqFCZM8Q;klx0kUUscw3I8hDDPzR0Ag;I thought it was a good hotel for the money. They offered to upgrade our room to a river view for only $10, which we would have done.The hotel was close to a few good restaurants and within walking distance of Trader Joe's, which was a plus!I didn't mind the elevator ride, parking was very easy, and it was a comfortable room. There was a cab always available for us to grab when we needed it, this is a hotel we'd stay in again.;4;0;0;0;7Hj22TFkgAeRCXjDQqb1oA

Visited Fillini for pre rehearsal dinner drinks and the service was excellent.   We had a post wedding breakfast in the Black Sea Lounge and the food and service were surperb!  I would highly recommend the Radisson Blu!;5;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
2597;8/14/2012;RW8Vm2yr0_Vo_554ArVhaQ;WlGVHC7RYslZp_Sjuvot1w;All new hotel. Our room had an amazing floor that reflected the light like tiny stars. Our room had extra wide doors ( for wheelchairs) and the bathwas probably also equiped for handicapt people. The consequence was that the shower was difficult to use standing in such a large wide bathtub.I'm sorry to say that the bar next to the lobby looked more like a cold/clean/white cantine or mess than like à bar.The staff was very friendly and the concierge(s) were very profesionnal and well informed about their city.Ask the frontdoor guys where to go for breakfast.

2599;5/30/2012;9gsCuFvcOx-Z7Q64u3kpiw;Yr-Bm0W6QTS5DDqdcsBhkg;Just got back after staying here for Memorial Day Weekend. After looking at all the pictures online and reading reviews, we were excited to stay here. The hotel did not disappoint. Upon reaching the hotel we were amazed by the gorgeous exterior. The hotel itself is a beauty. The inside is equally as stunning. The lobby area was very pretty and we really liked the long fireplace. Its a small lobby compared to other hotels, but it was extremely opulent and pretty. I guess we stayed in the basic room and I was really impressed. The floors are hardwood - I don't know why more hotels don't convert to this. It makes the place feel a lot cleaner and open. The bathroom is extremely large - maybe a little too large. There is a big bathtub and a big separate shower. The weird thing about the bathroom was there were no towel hooks or racks? This made it tricky to reuse towels or even just keep things looking tidy. The bed was comfy and they gave you plenty of pillows. I think there were over 8! There was also a large closet area with shelving inside. In terms of location, it was a little out of the way of Michigan Ave, but maybe that makes it more appealing. It wasn't loud in the area and its a short walk to Milennium Park (and the bean!) or to Michigan Ave. The staff were all very friendly and pleasant.I do recommend this hotel - it is a bit of a splurge compared to the other hotels in the area, but its a great place to treat yourself. If I am able to return to Chicago one day, I would stay here again.;4;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ
2600;4/13/2012;RBkBBvFo-e-MbLtTxDO-Yg;WGY7yx1RuNc0IHCcosYjZg;We recently spent another stay at The Radisson Aqua Blu.  LOVED IT AGAIN! This time we were put in a corner room overlooking the outdoor pool and walkway path.  This room is definitely brighter than the last room we stayed in since it had huge windows everywhere, outside balconies and full hardwood floors.  We also had a direct view of Navy Pier and were able to see the lights at the pier at night.  Just beautiful.  The room is huge and has a separate area for working with a small tv, desk and refrigerator/stocked bar in it.  This room also had a shower and tub we used nightly.  The tub was really large and deep.  Their beds and pillows are awesome and so soft.  The best part of the rooms are that they are extremely quiet and you never hear people walking through the hallway, EVER.  The weather was nice enough for us to enjoy the outside area.  We went for a walk on the pathway that goes around the whole building and were pleasantly surprised by the sponge walkway.  If you are a jogger it will definitely keep you from jarring your legs!  We ate at Filini restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner during our stays and have loved every meal we have been served.  We have eaten at many restaurants and Filini definitely is one of our favorites. The meals are excellent, gourmet and priced very typical of a Chicago restaurant.  When you sit down they bring cheese and bread to snack on while waiting for your meal.  The bar is our favorite also.  They have huge booths for groups and the bar is just inviting and very beautiful.  We had appetizers and drinks and the appetizers were extremely good.  We had the marinated olives, meatballs and eggplant parmesan.  Everything was seasoned perfect and perfect size for an appetizer.  We love to get a drink from the bar and then go to the lounge area with the full length fireplace.  The couches make you want to lay down and sleep they are so comfortable and cozy.  The staff we encountered are always nice and very helpful.  Bob, the doorman is always on task and available in a second.  We pick this hotel due to how beautiful and comfortable the whole hotel is.  Usually something suffers somewhere but there are no issues that I have found with this hotel.  This hotel is placed perfectly for walking tourists.  We were able to get to all the areas such as Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue within 15 -20 minutes. Definitely saves money on having to get taxis.;5;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

2603;1/31/2012;8szctkda-woCY45s9Lc-nQ;HFRIEv8D9zl0tKlViR5Rtw;This place is a cut above the rest.  From the moment that my wife and I arrived to the moment we left we had nothing but good things to say.  They have everything:we had plans in the city and scraped them for a night at the hotel.  The entire staff was smart, friendly, and warm.  From the exquisite customer service at the front desk, to the kind doorman and everyone in-between, this team knows how to treat their guests.  It is obviously a meticulously run location.  The room was unlike most in the city with an amazing view, hard wood floors and a modern bathtub and shower.  Our room was brand new.  It is also conveniently located next to a CVS, if you need to grab few random things, for the room.  However if you are looking for some place good to eat, stay in for room service or eat at the wonderful restaurant on location, at Filini. The head Chef Christian Fantoni creates food that makes you feel like a judge on the food network. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a great time and food in a perfect location.;5;0;0;0;HTBxJPblBauNNCm_qSQjSQ

2607;12/17/2011;dws2iIP2YXU3l1TTtzOe7A;UwnAhVt1qo2khxKwTYHuTA;When I walked in, I was taken aback because it looked like a club during happy hour.  It took me two laps to find the concierge and check-in (go straight back, to the left).Pros:The king bed was super comfy and I didn't want to get up in the mornings.The music and club atmosphere I actually enjoyed.  It made the experience different, new, and memorable rather than the typical hotels with the granda-esque drapes, blankets, and carpets that make you feel like you're in a 1950's hotel or your grandma's house.The concierge was friendly.  He made reservations at a local restaurant and called a cab for us.They have Bliss Spa products in the bathroom!!!Everyone there were young professionals.  Its definitely a popular happy hour spot.  We started at the lobby bar, went out for the night, and ended up back at the lobby bar for a night cap.  Then I just walked to the elevator and up to my room.  That was too easy :)Cons:The train is half a block away and could wake you up.There is a halogen light outlining the bed with its own light switch, kinda neat but kinda annoying.  I thought the glam factor was a bit overdone in the rooms.  They should keep that in the lobby.Watch out for the $8 Fiji water's in the room!  There's a 7-11 next door, dunkin donuts and subway across the street.They charge for internet/wifi ($15/day) unless you have a corporate deal.The bartender's didn't seem to have a very broad knowledge of drinks, but they were accommodating to our requests.There is no Bliss Spa at this location :(Overall:I will be staying here again next time I visit Chicago.;4;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
2608;1/26/2010;MyBj7GLUGxAnioybW6-tYQ;fyPDwhIVTlvuOPZnT7v_Dg;***Had to come back and comment. I just called the hotel and simply asked that they refund just one night of the three due to no water. They graciously complied. So it's all good. However, I just read a lot of people's complaints and most of them repeat the same thing, about having no water. So it's not an isolated incident. Obviously the W wouldn't have a hotel with no water or un-reliable water supply, so it must be something connected with the loop area of Chicago where the water simply gets shut off periodically.. I bet if they'd known that they would not have even opened up a hotel there in the first place. Imagine, a hotel where you can never rely on having water!I just had an out of town guest who is our business partner stay here for 3 nights because it's close to our offices. We were searching for a new hotel to bring all of our business guests to, and that's about 5 guests a month, plus or minus a few and also our satellite employees who visit once a month.First morning, our business partner gets up and there is NO WATER AT ALL. There was no water until almost noon. And then it was cold water. He had to keep calling over and over. When I came to pick him up, they said a boiler had broken (no emergency back up apparantly) and by the time they fixed it etc. The woman said "keep running the water and it will get warm". It didn't. No shower.  At minimum they should have jumped and said "oh my God, let us move you to a different room immediately, we'll get your things". Instead they kept discussing the issue instead of alerting the guest since they knew about it, handling it with a room move, and refunding the night. Just the one night, more than that would have been unfair.This morning, before he checked out, the best they could do was luke-warm water.  They did send beautiful chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of middle of the road champagne and gave me 8000 starwoods points, odd since I don't have a Starwood account. But frankly, they should have refunded that one night. You go to a hotel with the expectation that you will be able to shower and clean up after your travels. I am recommending to our company to strike them off the list for the way this issue was handled. It should have been a no-brainer "we are refunding the one night"  but I guess strawberries and a 5 dollar bottle of champagne are easier.;2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw
2609;4/22/2009;zkC1K98qsLsIDDTMF6M81w;9tcMOiiqc_rzJtqZKi4XnQ;Looks great...but:No closet, or anyplace to put your clothes in our room. The bathroom  was so tight I couldn't sit on the toilet seat unless I was leaning forward as the sink and wall were too close for almost anyone to fit, on and it was nearly impossible to flush said toilet seeing that it was pushed so close to the wall. You had to reach behind and come in that way to get it to work. The heating/cooling box banged every 30 mins starting at around 6:30 am. Oh and the parking for 1 night for guests was $51. Almost half of what we paid for the room. This was the first one we've stayed at so we're hoping that it was just the City Center version of the W.;2;0;0;0;ztuO0tozkkocR_o2OXDuQw

2611;6/18/2011;P1dYKC-Mfphz9T24sWm4ww;-0avJ-EVYjNCVwh0r_irUQ;where do I start. The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had. Anthony -the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. He set me up and quoted me a price of $125, When i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. At the end of the massage I gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change, She insisted that I got "A Hotel Rate" because Anthony set me up. She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $45. She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. In short - shady dealings with this place. I was quite taken back. The GM Selman comp'd me a night but , I felt swindled big time. Stay somewhere else. The concierge has something going on...;1;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

Valets are waiting for you as soon as you pull up to the hotel, but the parking is about 50 dollars a day.overall it's a nice hotel, but the last 2 days of our trip my friends and i stayed at a travelodge which was actually closer to the park, to the train stops, about twice as large and much much much cheaper.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg
2613;5/27/2009;h1zv4mxHFuUqMQl71uK0-g;X92H5cO7sznMhPC98FMhiA;Overall, our experience was positive (great location, clean, unique decor) but there were a few things that needed improvement: 1). Standard room was WAY to small. Our king-size bed took up most of the standing room. Forget about using the ironing board...You practically have to stand on your head! Luckily my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and really didn't mind the close quarters...Had we been there for more than two nights, or had there been ONE more person in the room, it could have gotten pretty ugly. 2). The fitness center was nice and had a variety of equipment, but only 2/4 treadmills worked. In a hotel that size, it was totally inadequate. 3) The walls are tissue-paper thin. I was in the hallway, a full five doors away from our room and I could hear my husband's telephone conversation quite clearly despite the fact that he was speaking in a regular tone of voice. 4)  An in-room coffee pot has become a standard amenity at most hotels...*ahem... Did someone forget to mention that to the staff at the Allegro? 5) Speaking of beverages, where did they hide all the vending machines? Oh yeah, they don't have any. I guess this is to ensure that we'll purchase the high-priced drinks/snacks from the in-room "wet bar". The wine hour didn't make up for it either, since we don't drink alcohol. I suggest you take a stash of pop if you're in the same boat.  6) Word of caution: Even though it's located in a great place, surrounding restaurants tend to close early...maybe because everyone heads to the theaters? Don't get caught hungry after about 6 pm. Your choices will be severely limited unless you want to get a cab.Finally, would we stay again? For the quality and price, you betcha!.;4;0;0;0;ubNzerxb8ox5bmA2EGkKBg

But the most outstanding thing about this hotel what its incredible staff. They went above and beyond every hotel i've ever stayed in. Most were multilinguial as well.

Very cool place and I love the spacious size of the rooms and the river view rooms! Great location. The staff is great, friendly, professional and welcoming. However, was really disappointed this visit. While clean, our room was less than perfect. Very dusty light and ventilation screens in the bathroom, and ceiling in disrepair. Used K-cup left in machine from last guest. As much as I love it, very expensive considering some of the somewhat run down condition. At almost $200/night even with a discount, unfortunately not worth it with SO many other great choices in the area.;3;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

Me and my husband are still in awe about sausage, scrambled eggs etc...* The breakfast put is in the mind of homemade southern cuisine.  It made us feel like we were at home away from home.* The COFFEE was delicious!!!! I over indulged and had over 3 mugs every morning.*The hotel was immaculately clean! You could basically eat off of the floors!* There was plenty of closet space and the actual room itself was HUGE!*The chaise was so comfortable, that it felt like I had fallen asleep on a cloud.* The VIEW was breathtaking!* It felt as though we had spent the whole weekend in paradise!*This hotel was walking distance to tourist attractions!!!!!!!I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT HOTEL 71!!!!!!!!!!!! I DON'T HAVE ONE NEGATIVE THING TO WRITE...I would most definitely encourage anyone traveling to Chicago to stay at this hotel...;5;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
2618;8/5/2011;CVW1ejIM-fav3Yn8Eh5Z4Q;FxQ-r_clkprjEvWeXsPotw;It all started when the Bellman lost control of the luggage cart and it hit and left a dent in our rental car.  Long story short, I had to contact my insurance company and the hotel would not admit liability, They told me I had to get a police report to document the accident for the hotel insurance.  If it hadn't been for Mike E. the assistant manager at the Front Desk who called the police and asked them to repond to a non-emergency at the hotel I would have had to give up precious vacation time and go to the police station.  It ended up the police came at 11 pm and Mike was there to offer support.  The Director of Security ,who is in charge of handling these kinds of incidents, has had limited contact with me and his follow-through has been an email 6 weeks after the incident.To top it all off when checking-out of the hotel, they only charged me for 2 days of parking vs. the actual 4 days I parked.  I was honest and paid the bill in full.Do you think that Hotel 71 offered any "good will" compensation for my time and trouble for the what they say was a "training issue" on the part of their employee the Bellman?  Nada, nothing Regarding our room, while it is great there are two sinks and the room is spacious, we had to call two times that the bathtub drain was not working and it was never fixed properly during our 4 day stay.;2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

2620;1/15/2011;kkYt3yp9tNwC-6h02mq_EQ;CoS7IjhQOrPf7O-5vlr6gQ;WARNING -We stayed over a holiday weekend - the hotel was over run by "gang bangers" who literally were shouting, screaming, fighting in the hallways. People were falling down drunk in the halls. We stayed in our room literally fearing gunfire would erupt , I'm not making this up.  We will never go back to Hotel 71. Consider staying here for the excellent location and price IF, and only if,  you are staying midweek for business. There is little else to recommend this hotel. Boutique? This is a 36 floor tower with hundreds of rooms! There are few good things to say about Hotel 71 other then it's location, right on Wacker and close to everything including local transportation. Given that we spent little time at the hotel, it served our purposes. We booked a three night stay at appx. $130.00 a night and requested a top floor and river view, which was excellent.  The room was decorated but sparse - insufficient writing desk with poor lighting, no pad or pens provided, cheap do it yourself coffee service on desk. Nice settee and the king bed was comfy and clean, I inspected for signs of bedbugs and found none, thankfully, but always check any hotel room immediately. Blankets and pillows were slightly upscale. Bathroom was supplied with minimal soap and shampoo, and threadbare towels, barely meeting cheap motel standards. And your closet is in the bathroom!Hotel 71 has major problems.  First the lobby -- there is none. Think I'm kidding? - try finding a photo of the Hotel 71 lobby:well yes there is a smallish bare bones seating area in front of the front desk but that's it, frankly I've seen better lobbies at the cheapest Motel 6. This carries over to the "bar - dining area" bare floor with IKEA style seating that has all the comfort and charm of a bus station at night. Clearly there is a cultural disconnect between Hotel 71 ownership and the expectations of the clients.  However, we were not expecting to spend anytime at the hotel so for us, no problem but your expectations may not be met. But the problems went deeper. Only 2 elevators serve the upper floors and one was out and remained unrepaired over the entire time - making the trip up to the 36th floor more of a commute then an elevator ride. This is unacceptable. It's a shame that the friendly and caring staff are stuck in a physical building that is far from welcoming as possible. Stay here midweek if you need the central location and do not expect to spend anytime here. Do not even THINK about staying here if hotel accommodations and comfort are an important part of your travel plans.;2;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
2621;10/14/2010;xxmyeb6g4eIa3NzDwWsiQA;T3bZeyLpaLNYlLKjVRp0sA;What a place.  Excellent location right in clean downtown and within short walking distance to the "Magnificent Mile."   The view from our 32nd Floor River View room was lovely, up and down the river with their recently redone colorful waterfront.  Even with glorious sunsets, and the Trump Tower (the second highest building in North America) is right across. We had lucked out. Booked at a very low rate through an international Internet travel agency, which went belly-up, and we were cancelled.  But an absolutely great customer service lady, Diane Pena, went all out to get us back in with a river view at the originally confirmed price.   Professional and attentive door service.  Truly appreciative of a gratuity.  Very pleasant, cheerful and welcoming reception.  Joelle, one of the best anywhere.  Room and bathroom inviting, large, bright, and clean.  Big comfortable bed.  A fridge you have to ask for in advance.  But...they still use old, electricity-guzzling incandescent bulbs.  No one else does that any more in our extensive travels.  Hey, save electricity and money.Would we come back?  Of course.  Soon.  Altogether, in Mid-September, the hotel added to a dream vacation.;5;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg
2622;6/15/2010;TY2ZSxmjdwupovzC5ThNwQ;1LrTyFM1Yw97I_ZDmqReQg;I traveled to Chicago last year and booked here on a cousin's recommendation. The staff couldn't have been friendlier and the location more convenient (at Wacker Drive and Michiagan Avenue). Don't miss the 71 East Cafe, which has great options for lunch and dinner. My room was large, spacious and offered great city views. I snagged a low rate through http://www.getaroom.com. My only gripe was that parking was expensive, but it was to be expected considering the location.;4;0;0;0;JF1adUKdsNebw6-8MABATg

The food was excellent! The portion sizes are a good size and not overdone. The prices are above average, but the food is not boring by any means. Would come again!! The hotel was actually very kid friendly which we had our doubts about. There were cookies and milk the first night, the concierge was good about knowing the family friendly places to go, the pool was wonderful!  The workout area was very nice!! Great experience! The backpacks filled with toys were a lifesaver! We were close to navy pier and the Disney store! The girls loved it!;4;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ

2626;5/3/2012;ylZkPRjOUENRy6s6Cjr6dw;1URt0ckoK9aA5lw1fJSf5Q;We had the Perfect Wedding!!! From start to finish my husband and I had a phenomenal experience planning our wedding with the Omni Chicago. The food - staff - facilities - and overall standard of service was phenomenal. Logistically it was so easy to get married at Holy Name Cathedral, have a fantastic view of Michigan Avenue at the 676 restaurant for our cocktail hour, and have our reception and guest rooms in one building. The food that was served at our reception was served hot and tasted phenomenal.The front desk and maintenance staff were very helpful and even put up an extra hook in my closet so we could hang up my wedding dress. The entire event went off without a hitch and far surpassed our expectations - and those were bridal expectations :) Sarah Johnson was our event manager and she made us feel at ease and excited about our wedding from the start. She was extremely professional, flexible, very responsive, easy to work with, and an overall pleasure to be around. I am a very detailed oriented bride and we never worried about a thing. Thank you for such an incredible event!!!;5;0;0;0;eR7cmuIRnvYFrexno_wlcQ
2627;4/1/2012;GWH6B_qM-PFBGQFuq4GX0g;38-TXsKCKJuoxXV9MldJLQ;I booked my stay via Travelocity and got a great rate (under $70 a night). I was a little worried about how I'd be treated by the hotel front desk because of this, but everything was wonderful. Check in wasn't until 3 but we arrived around 2 and were able to get to our room. The woman at the front desk was very nice, and she gave us a room away from the elevators on a high floor. Our room also had a view of lake Michigan which was a very nice surprise. The room was beautiful, the king sized bed was very comfy, and the bathroom was completely new...which leads me to why I give this hotel 4 stars. The door to the bathroom is a sliding door and it wasn't installed properly. There is a sizable gap, and you can see right into the bathroom. That's fine if you're staying alone, not so much with a traveling companion. You can also hear EVERYTHING that happens in the bathroom, including what your neighbors are doing if you catch my drift. One final complaint, the heating/cooling vents were loud. Everytime the heat kicked in at night, it woke me up. (I'm a light sleeper) Final verdict: I would stay  here again, the location was great but I'd bring earplugs.;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
2628;2/22/2012;lqQJ-l7xfOacVUxfvfvgnA;bMq7qjyzmyadQXKQhATKRg;My boyfriend and I stayed at the Knickerbocker on a Friday night in February.  We are from Northern Indiana and he was picking me up from the Chicago Airport so we decided to make a date night out of it.  We scored a pretty great deal "naming our own price" on Priceline, so that made it even better!  The hotel itself is beautiful, we found all the staff we spoke with to be extremely helpful and friendly.  I had requested champagne and chocolate covered strawberries be delivered to the room before we got there and it was waiting for us as promised when we arrived.  We had planned to park across the street instead of paying the $50/night for valet parking but it took us an hour and a half to get through the Friday night rush hour traffic from the airport to the hotel, so we caved and paid the $50 so that we wouldn't have to get back into the car again that evening.We had several questions for the woman at the reception desk and she gladly answered them all for us.We only had two complaints, first the when we entered the room it was a tad stuffy, so I turned the thermostat on the wall down while we got ready for dinner, hoping that by the time we got back to the room it would be nice and cool.  But when we returned it was still 71 degrees in the room (we like it cool to sleep, plus it was just stuffy.)  So I tried turning it down again, but it didn't seem to work.  So I called the front desk and she said the whole hotel runs on the same system and they were currently in heat mode, so there wasn't much I could do with the thermostat, but offered to have someone bring up a fan right away.  The fan helped and we were able to get a good nights sleep.Our only other complaint (which is partially our fault) is that because we had ordered breakfast to be delivered to the room in the morning we didn't put up the "Do Not Disturb" sign and we had about 6-7 knocks at the door from 8:30am until we left at 11:30am.  They knocked when they slipped the bill under the door at 8:30, then housekeeping came by several times, along with a man checking mini-bars.  I have worked in hotels and understand that they want to get their rooms ready and I know we didn't put the sign out, but it just got a little annoying.Our room service breakfast was quite good!  I had the french toast, which was awesome! And my boyfriend had bacon, eggs and toast. Overall we had a great experience and would definitely go back again!  But next time we will use the door sign!;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

A bellman gave us a tour of the hotel that many guests do not get, seeing an old speakeasy on a floor that was only discovered in the 1990s. fantastic history in the hotel and worth seeing.  i did not care for the hidden fees in the stay, but again, the history of the place is amazing.;4;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
2630;10/23/2011;9XNlBx_PXVafdlHJPrUTFQ;bgjdAQxxpO4T6sLAcUhlQQ;I would never stay at this hotel again. I booked a king suite for my sister's bachelorette weekend so we'd have space to get ready and open some gifts before heading out for the night. When we checked in (at 5:15 p.m.) we were informed that the previous night's guests had checked out late so the room was not clean. They kindly provided us with drink vouchers and we settled in to the martini bar to wait for what we assumed would be a reasonable amount of time. AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER I revisited the desk and asked what was going on. I was informed that the previous night's guests actually hadn't checked out until 45 MINUTES AFTER we had arrived at 6 p.m. (check in is listed at 3 p.m.). This was directly in conflict with the previous statement that "housecleaning is in the room cleaning it right now." Despite checking in at 5 p.m. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE ROOM UNTIL 7:30 p.m. (four and a half hours after we were supposed to be able to check in). Hotel staff could only say "sorry, we really have no control over when guests leave." What?!  While we were waiting, three other guests came to the desk with assorted other complaints. The hotel room phones did not work so we had to use cell phones to call the front desk. Staff noted that they did not work but did not come to fix them until we were checking out the next day. In addition, we had to ask three times for extra beverage glasses (which took a half an hour to show up), and had to request linens for the fold out bed as well. Speaking with upper management the day after was less than delightful. They did agree to deduct a small portion of the room price, but only after repeated complaints and difficulty. The hotel is lovely with lots of character. Too bad the same cannot be said for the management. . . For my money I'd rather stay someplace that can be counted on to provide a positive experience.;1;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
2631;8/6/2010;PNJkbOd3LrOo9uGk3WrPsQ;jID_nTGyCIjUt00ssIyjbw;We prepaid two nights in advance, called and told them we would be arriving late, and told them we needed two double beds to accommodate three guests. They said "no problem." We arrived a little after 1 a.m. and were told they were out of rooms and they were making arrangements at another hotel for us for the night. They could have called us to tell us that, and we would have driven straight to the hotel they were going to ship us to without parking our car with their $50 valet for that evening. So, we enjoyed a cab ride across town to the Allegro. The hotel they sent us to only had rooms with one king bed - no doubles. So, we had to have the desk person at the new hotel barter with the Millennium to get them to provide us with enough beds to sleep in. Overall, they made things more or less "right," but the manner in which it was handled was really poor, and I really don't expect much. We ended up back at the Millennium the next night. The rooms themselves were nice, and Dave the bartender at the martini bar is a super cool dude.;1;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw
2632;10/9/2009;4qTni0lVYzDkRyT7OkQ34g;gtEEkqBDrTNUmApgFNBHnQ;The Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel just refused to change or cancel my reservation for this evening even though I have the flu (and someone in my class was diagnosed with the swine flu). I'm a low risk person (30 y/o) for complications from swine flu, so I'm not really concerned for my own safety. I don't plan on leaving the house (to go the a doctor's office or hospital) for fear of getting others sick, but I am amazed at how irresponsible the Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel could be to not issue a refund or change my reservation. One would think the hotel industry would be especially sensitive to getting their customers sick with the swine flu. Hopefully the Knickerbocker is just an abhorrent exception.;1;0;0;0;sGhw4H2gzW0psZom0QuZMw

2641;6/12/2012;pgf6ofgOQrhJZ7QIt30l5Q;jmnkakscAXjLWp0ysrobBg;This hotel had a great location walking distance to the Shedd aquarium.  We walked to the aquarium though the park and used the tunnels under Lake Shore Drive to get to the aquarium in under 10 minutes.  The room I booked was a queen bed with a very small side room with a table and loveseat.  The decoration was outdated and with a more detailed glance at doors, countertops and floors, you could see some a need for updates.  We used the pool which had not been cleaned that day - however it was a little chilly that day.  The staircase was creepy, but I think most staircases are creepy. There was a charge of $29/30 each day to have your car parked.  This is the latest in hotel charge trends, but it still seems a bit much.  However, it was easy to park the car with blinkers and then jump out to check in and let them park the car.  The front desk did offer to get my car at any time.  Wi-fi was free and the front desk gave me the username and password upon check in which was great.  This was an easy and great surprise as I just stayed at a Hilton that charged for wi-fi.I think the noise level of the city was easy to hear from the hotel.  I heard some loud noises at night from the city and hotel which didn't make for the best night sleep.  The TV was not outdated as the other reviews suggested, but there seemed to be limited channels.The best dining option was the diner behind the hotel and a block south with great breakfast, dinner and dessert options.  For other dining options, it was easy to catch a cab.;2;0;0;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

2643;5/11/2010;F8bVA_vFPMu_NQjKclGQEQ;0OX_1gH1tuSYLUlrnl9wIA;As someone who traveled every weekend during undergraduate and graduate school, this is BY FAR THE WORST hotel stay I have EVER experienced. Apparently this hotel can't keep up with the expedia orders and there is around a three hour delay from the point you make the reservation to the point the hotel enters it. Now, this is a KNOWN issue, but of course there is no warning on their page or in their e-mail. So when I showed up luggage in hand (an hour and a half after making the reservation) after waiting in line for 10 min, I was informed that I would have to wait for her to deal with the other 10 people before she could help me. This took about 45 min. It should never take 45 to check into a hotel. Moreover, when I finally got up to the desk the women took the confirmation sheet and asked for my ID. I informed her that the person I was sharing the room with made the reservations. She informed me that she could not allow me to check in until the girl got there. Since she was at a work function I would have had to wait for about 7 hours. I asked her if there was anything I could do and she just stared at me blankly. Finally, I asked to speak to a manager. Once with the manager I explained the situation and put him on the phone with the girl I was rooming with. He was hostile towards her but finally agreed to let me in the room. Next, I get to the room and try to connect to the 'free' internet. Of course it is not working. I'm not really surprised at this point. I call the in house help number, which puts me through to the front desk which is plainly pissed that I am calling, and unable to tell me anything other than to call the Broad Band Support number. I call they tell me the problem is at the hotel and they are going to call the hotel to try and fix it. It never got fixed. The I was like well there is no internet, so i'll check out the pool. Of course, the other information not posted is that their pool is an outdoor and has been closed for MONTHS.Then when I get back to the room, half of the lights in the room don't work,WORST HOTEL EVER.

2644;3/25/2008;ILjtV5sMq5MP-w3W7Q4oIA;mHK-fVTEIwJDcvut2nFUXA;DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this hotel.  It may be an affordable price and a decent location, but what they gain in location/price, they lose in service and cleanliness.  The specific area of concern is with the on-site restaurant on the first floor of the establishment.  My family and I (two kids) were ignored for 20 minutes due to the server being exasperated (and we were the ONLY ONES in the restaurant).  We were never given so much as a menu, a glass of water, or a smile throughout the entire ordeal. We are still, to this day, wondering why we deserved this cold treatment.My recommendation is to look up the street toward the Michigan/Wacker Drive area along the Chicago River for great restaurants and hotels.  We've stayed and eaten many times at various establishments in this location (Club Quarter, Hyatt Regency, Emerald Loop, etc.) and have been VERY pleased.  And for only $20-$40 more per night, it's definitely worth the cost to have excellent, efficient, and friendly service, not to mention a stellar view of the Magnificent Mile and Chicago River.  Much better than seeing that dump-of-a-train-station on Roosevelt Road.  THAT PLACE IS CREEPY!  Avoid the Grant Park Best Western at all costs.;1;0;0;0;D3tzOb9LneB10eNNooZyBg

The front desk people were well enough. They didn't look too happy but they gave us place to visit while we stayed. The view from our hotel room sucke. Did I really want to wake up facing a dirty alley? NO. My car was safe and sound and the "consierge" (sp?) was great.

2651;12/3/2007;i7QCnMAYRx7piNeYIiBsLA;d6fbd_g_parSSWAc1LCC0A;We just got back from Chicago. We stayed in the Best Western River North. The service was excellent and we even got upgraded to a Suite for no additional charge. It was a nice modern place, we even had a balcony.I enjoyes the amanities like Indoor Pool,Fitness Room/Health Spa,Pizzeria Ora.

2652;7/25/2011;GFD0eOfQw6HivOpO-r6aSA;9tUW0wYbb9UM6EzTOJ1JLw;The two stars are for the truly beautiful room.  The missing stars are for the fact that everything else is extra--a LOT extra.  Examples: overnight valet?  That's 51$.  Sending out a pair of socks for washing? 11$.  Want internet?  That will be 15$ per day.  Using the fitness room?  10$/day.  Like a cup of coffee in the morning?  It will be charged to your room.To top it all off, this huge hotel seems to have a customer service staff of no more than 4 people at any one time. As a result, it is extremely impersonal (but, I'm sure, very lucrative for the owners.) In summary, if you like being treated like a giant wallet instead of a valued customer, try the Fairmont--it's super pretty!;2;0;0;0;57PyRW-iahNX_Ur8icAfxg
2653;10/26/2011;_2b1UrZk8Yzli2oqTHqJjw;ZTr6Kr4AYdqYQLVN5AWHxQ;Indeed all the negative reviews below are correct. I was always skeptical about reviews, but this is the first one I am writing! I HAVE to tell others not to come to this place! I stayed on 2-star hotels before and my expectations were as such. But this one was atrocious! The carpet was so old it is paper-thin in places and holes are about to show up. All the color was gone. The window curtain was broken on one side with a corner hanging down and some metal sticking out. There wall paper was peeling in the bathroom and some wires were visible too. The room was heavily parfumed (I guess it would stink otherwise) I could not breath. I left after I checked in and got another hotel, forget the money I lost. I felt like I was in a hotel in a third world country like Uzbekistan.;1;0;0;0;wJJi0pIHTus5d_DWoz9TKQ
2654;1/21/2011;y6Kg53CEuukyCMg7Ze8QKQ;z1H6dMGQ_wxJGqpR_kK_Ag;We rented (3) rooms, this is not a Hotel, this is a Motel: The rooms: 1 room the shower curtain was broken, only the first and last loop was attached to the overhead pole, there were two shower heads because one the water trickled out (down) and the other one, the head shot off and hit me in the chest, the shower hose sprayed water out and up the whole time you showered. 1 room the lock didn't work, the other room the duvet was yellow stained and had wood pieces all over the bed. None of the rooms had the in room safe as advertised, beds are hard as a rock, musty smelling, we tried to get a microwave to pop popcorn that they sale at the vending machine and was told by the front desk that they no longer supply them, but we could use the employee's behind the front desk. No HBO, no pay movies and no video games were available or even offered. The Facility:The fitness room, was 1 piece of equipment that was/and has been broken for some time, the Bristo restaurant has been closed down for a couple years. The outdoor pool has been closed down for some time, the indoor pool is no longer a pool. They do have a shuttle "van" that will pick you up at the airport, the back door is broken on it and has to pulled open and closed by a couple cords, per the driver who spoke little English it has been broken for sometime. The hall ways were dirty with stains on the walls. The wirelss only worked while in the lobby and that was if the wind wasn't blowing and it wasn't cold outside, which during the winter that's difficult. I've never felt so dirty after leaving the hotel, I couldn't wait to get home and take a "clean" shower!The Staff-I felt bad for the front desk, but hey I guess they could leave. Everybody checking out around the same time we were complained. I called 2 days ahead to get ajoining rooms since we were getting 3 rooms and 2 of them were 1 family, the front desk lady that answered the phone said to call the night before we were checking in, so I did, they said oh you have to do that when you check in, so when we checked in we were told, we don't have ajoining room, very frustrating why didn't they tell me that the first 2 times I called.;1;0;0;0;wJJi0pIHTus5d_DWoz9TKQ

Her and her boyfriend were about to check in when the lady told them it wasn't time to check in when it said on their website they could. So they had to drive all the  way to Naperville wiith my aunt screaming in pain. Plus, you have to use the crappy internet service they give you . You could only use it in the lobby which was always crowded because of that cause... I HATED IT!;1;0;0;0;wJJi0pIHTus5d_DWoz9TKQ

The services are up to the mark and food too is good. What I loved about this hotel was their love for pets. Pets are not just allowed in the hotel but are pampered too. Then you have relaxing in-room spa services. To my surprise, Amalfi Hotel Chicago offers different packages. I should not forget to mention - Unique Packages - Refuel & Re-energize package, Home Run Package and Romance Package are the only ones I can recollect. Altogether, it was a nice experience with nothing to complain about.;4;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
2658;3/12/2012;i40YOlI-AA8g7MDjBNRl9A;FhxVjBYnqBL427nbV3AYrw;overall a nice hotel. lots of pros, lots of cons, and for the price, not what i expected our first time in Chitown.Cons- y on earth did they not tell us about happy hour? i mean i told them i was new, tell me what u have to offer. i called downstairs 3x and no one answered my call, i had to go downstairs and the lady told me "we must have been busy" really? upon checkin, i showed up at about 10pm, and was first told that because i was late i got moved out of my delux king and into a twin queen bed room? i told him sternly me and my fiance are not staying in a queen double bed, next thing u know there was a "cancellation" and i could get the room, cmon now im in sales i know that line.  the TV is small, not alot of channels, the delay absolutely sux, and i have to raise my arm like an antenna to change the channel. there were cookies on the desk, cant have em unless u get charged 5 or 6 bucks, i mean cmon? water bottle? 7$! and this is not even mentioning the fridge. one of the highest priced hotels, and a small deluxe room, just expected more i guess. Y dont they take our bags to our rooms i mean they will probably get tipped....ANd the worst thing of all, i waS trying heating up food, but no MICROWAVE!! r u kidding??PROS- double shower head is great. finally a comfy bed. i mean extremely soft and comfortable with great pillows. cont. breakfast on each floor is a nice touch. the door guys are extremely nice. Pius, Rafi, Hi :) .  liked the robes as well. really nice location as well. semi nice view, if ur higher than the 10th floor. will try another hotel next time.;3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw
2659;3/9/2012;q2IJ8Loc-9VgvSP1P2kRjA;RBADcQD6vWT1ze0tNDeQHQ;What can I say -- this hotel is CUTE.I stayed here on business.  All in all it was just okay.  It's not my idea of upscale, but rather a decent, no frills, moderately-priced facility.WHAT I LIKED:1.  If a random person asked me where's a good place to shower, I'd say "Amalfi!".  Yep, folks, the dual head shower provided great pressure to get me squeaky clean.2. The soft bed and two kinds of fluffy pillows (one round, one flatter).  It's hard to sleep in most hotels, but that bedding cradled me like mommy's bosom.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:1.  I picked the Amalfi because of its breakfast on every floor.  Man, was I disappointed.  Cold continental breakfasts don't suit me.  I couldn't even heat up my croissant.2.  That darn TV had a severe delay, plus I had to contort my body into odd positions just to get the precise angle for the remote and tv to communicate.  In the middle of a program, the tv would reset and take me back to the menu screen.  Aaargh!3.  I had a corner room and loved how the entire wall was windows on one side.  Beaming with excitement, I peak out and find myself with an unobstructed view of a brick wall.  smhAmalfi is okay.  Definitely not my top pick in that area, but I'd stay if I had too.;3;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

2661;8/23/2010;FJbfuIGC0a_hbjNlyX2gJA;6bO0Bx4W7rvt_aPGGIutEA;I agree, five stars. The staff was very friendly, professional and quick. They had the perfect recommendations for sightseeing, dining and drinking. Hangover cure breakfast @ 1 pm - the Temple Cafe was the right suggestion. The room was modern and sleek, with the most comfortable bed out of any hotel I have stayed at (and I travel for work plenty). Continental breakfast on every floor - thus allowing the guests to sneak out in pjamas, grab delicious fluffy croissants, and run away back to the room. The location was perfect - minutes from the CTA, right next to the river, and walking distance to many sights, Mag Mile, dinning and boozing. Yay Amalfi...thanks for the wonderful time.;5;0;0;0;HwJkHmF__Y2VApOA31GqQw

2663;3/24/2012;UPMm47RUniJvr79Bgke3zA;kkPcKWdvIFPCqagW8L6-MA;My friend and I came to Chicago for a day to go to a concert and needed someplace reasonably priced to stay. We had read mixed reviews and decided to take a chance on this hotel, because the more recent reviews were actually pretty decent. We should have found someplace a little bit pricier to stay. It. Was. Terrible. I have to admit the location is spectacular and the staff seemed friendly when we first got there. They explained that because of the above average temperatures the air conditioner wasn't working, and it was going to be a little warm in our room. So we think, okay, maybe it'll be like 70-ish in the room as opposed to you know, comfortable temperatures. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. They threw us on the very top floor, and it was 90 DEGREES OR HIGHER THE ENTIRE TIME. It was ridiculous. They explained to us that if it was too hot in the room, we could go downstairs and get a room change. So we went downstairs to ask. You know what happened? NOTHING. We were stuck in that about 90 degrees room. It was like if we were in a humid desert in there. They wouldn't even give us a FAN or something to at least cool the room off a little bit. Not even the least bit accommodating. It was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I have asthma, so the sweltering and humid heat didn't do me any good at all. What would have happened if I had an asthma attack and asked for a refund? Probably nothing, because they didn't seem all that accommodating after they explained to us that the air wasn't working properly. It was like they were saying "Yeah, we warned you, too bad, you are stuck here!". I mean it was so hot that if I got a total of like an hour and a half of sleep probably. Same goes for my friend. Overall I wouldn't go back there at all. Other than the location and a reasonable place to lay down your head, I wouldn't go back there.;1;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
2664;4/29/2011;m9wIHrIfFOOZR38SVcbAQQ;UtUhedAB9DeOcVBG9Np4BA;Dude! Cockroaches. Really? And no coffee maker in the room? I don't care if there is a push button cappucino maker in the lobby. There's no coffee maker in the room.Other than the cockaroaches and the no coffee maker it was super, but still only worth 2 stars because of the cockroaches. I was able to get a nice clean room with 2 queen sized beds in there, real nice. The TV operated nice and simple, none of that menu stuff. But I do believe there was a large population of people living there. I know there was some sort of homeless bicyclist hanging outside for a bit.Rancho Cordova, CA probably doesn't have much to offer besides Motel 6 but maybe next time I'll take a look there. At $70 it was a pretty good deal. But I should get a credit for there being no coffee maker in the room and for my room already being rented out to a cockaroach.;2;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
2665;8/24/2009;9ygH8z63YYedmvaGvp4H4A;DO_wGulp1Rjr_7ZyqgjEvQ;I don't care what anybody else says, this Hotel sucks. 117.00 for room and 36.00 for parking (which they will lie and tell you no other parking is available). I found clothing left by a previous guest under the bed. You had to flush the toliet 3-4 times before it finally had enough power to flush. Hair was on the toliet seat and in the tub. I had to use stck a washcloth in the bathtub hole to keep my bath water from draining because there was no bathtub stopper. The flatscreen T.V remote control had a missing poweron/off button. The volue and channel buttons were confused. The walls are so thin that I heard every word of the guys next door.. When I called to complain, they told me that it was the only room left. What a ripoff. I found out later there is parking down the street that's so much cheaper, bu they siad it wasn't anywhere else to park. The housekeeprs are lazy, rude, and the front desk agents were rude, unprofessional, mean, and I must also add GHETTO!!!! I will NEVER stay at another red roof, more less this one!!!!! There service sucks!;1;0;0;0;Yc5wFFyMhyYsxI2Z4bhkng
2666;9/12/2011;i9c6PppPTFjC-MPMENT10g;FbTVDOA0aXxRzOIkQuU-zw;A great lil' boutique-style place to stay in Chicago - terrific and personalized service from a genuinely nice staff (they printed out our schooner tickets for us at the front desk), and a great restaurant, the Atwood Cafe, with an amazing bartender (Ray) and a first-rate executive chef (Derek Simcik), really made this a place that we were tempted not to leave at all!  In the end, we did wind up going out, though, since the hotel is within walking distance of attractions like Millennium Park, the Theater District (got 11th-hour tickets to Alison Krauss's only show at the the Chicago Theater totally by accident - we only knew she was there because we could read the marquee from our room!), and the Chicago Institute of Art (with its amazing new wing). Definitely worth checking out!;5;0;0;0;ojCaK0Z7nSMB8gPGbyjzAw
2667;12/28/2010;VkuQWY5xTd-1PawmiOLR9Q;0l7L_MU7uq8NnyoWWaiEnA;I stayed here for a convention at the McCormick Center in Chicago and The Silversmith was a decent hotel. It was clean and my room was very large. I had a separate living and sleeping area with a king bed. As I was on the 8th floor facing the side where the trains ran, I could still hear the train from that high up. It wasn't loud enough to keep me from sleeping, but it was bothersome. Otherwise, the location of the hotel was great, right on Jewelers Row and surrounded by a decent shopping area. I especially liked the Nordstrom Rack and Macy's nearby.But even so, I will probably not be staying here ever again. When I first arrived, I had requested from the front desk some extra toiletries to be sent up to my room, as the ones they provide are sparse. The front desk said someone would be up with them soon. No one ever came and I still did not receive new or more toiletries my whole stay here (I checked in on a Saturday evening and checked out on a Thursday). I also tried to request a late check-out as my convention ended at 2 PM on Thursday, but the latest they could accommodate me was only 12:30 PM, barely any difference from their current check-out time of 12 PM. So I checked out and left my luggage with the bell hop there until I could come back and retrieve it. When I did come and try to retrieve it, I waited half an hour for a bell hop to arrive at their stand near the entrance of the hotel and no one ever came. I went to the front desk with my luggage ticket and asked to receive my luggage, they radio-ed the bell hop and they didn't even receive a response. I proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for someone to finally come to retrieve my luggage. I believe one of the hotel cleaning staff working in the lobby had to come and help me get my bags.The internet is also neither wireless or hi-speed. I ended up getting so frustrated by the lack of wireless internet and slow speed of the wired internet, that I ended up using my iPad data plan for most of my stay here.I would expect more from a hotel for the rate I received (Ranged from $169 to $279 per night during my Sat. through Thurs. stay). Luckily, I was staying here for business, otherwise I would be very disappointed in how much I spent on this room.;2;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

BUT DO NOT BELIEVE YELP!! I went there with 4 friends and we had booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds or 1 king bed. But they gave us just 1 queen bed in both the rooms. We asked the front desk employee (Barbara) to give us a room that we asked for or compensate. But she was very rude and said she does not have anything for the entire weekend and we have to accomodate in whatever room we are getting. Then we asked for the manager (Shannon) who was not available at the time. We asked them to have her call us back but she didnt for 2 days. Then again I went at the time Shannon was present. She was ruder than Barabara. She told me told me that she does not want to talk to us and asked us to go back to our room. Jeremy, Shannon's manager also didn't call us after leaving several messages. We were here for 3 nights and for all the 3 nights we ended up staying in the 1 queen bed rooms. Everybody was really rude. To top it, the hotel is really dated with dated and stinky rooms. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!;1;0;0;0;RTbDvRlBaKyim0MJOzEkPQ

I couldn't shower  because the whole handle came off the shower, not to mention we had trouble getting hot water a couple of times. Also most of the hotel staff was incredibly rude and not helpful. The russian doorman were incredibly lazy and I had to tell them what to do. The only two people that were helpful at all were Pablo at the front desk and Rasheed the bell man. Before checking out, we checked the room for anything we might have forgotten. We found a glass under the bed filled with mold. I had been sick all week because I am allergic to mold, and it now makes sense because the Hotel seems to be covered in mold.I will never stay at this hotel again.

2681;3/16/2012;LT-KMi3Xf5_4pgAYhU5OhQ;3dp3INq5p44QBbuP1cVbww;The only highlight of this place is Jean-George's food. The lobby is pretty but not functional for hotel guests. The rooms are pretty dismal in comparison to Ian Schrager's Gramercy Park Hotel. They are unfinished and dirty. Calling this place "Minimal" is an excuse for lacking attention to detail. It seems like the only renovation that was made to the rooms was throwing in some Ikea esque particle board furniture and a cheap white paint job. I would recommend staying at somewhere else and stopping by for a bite to eat. Overall, this was huge let down after my experience with Ian's Gramercy Park Hotel.;1;0;0;0;S_wqr0_GkrNOvgVVgp7__w
2682;2/22/2012;8Gj20O24nQUaDnGixBWrcw;HBZmGoWTUz6ZTXo7T3Wzxg;My Husband and a friend stayed stayed 1 night (2/16/2012) here after driving cross country (from Spokane, WA) to purchas a classic car and needed some rest. We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisors reviews. Room and staff were great but on 2/16 about 9pm my husband was harrassed by a drug dealer to buy cocaine, this happen right by the valet area. The next morning at 7:30am his friend was also harrassed by a different man to buy crack. My husband discussed this with the valet staff and was told it is not the first time someone reported this. My husband spoke with Andrew the Mgr. who stated there was nothing he could do since this happened on the street ....street? this happen in front of the valet area. I am sure if a hotel employee stated my husband harrassed them by the valet area security tapes would be pulled or he would be told to leave. As a HGI member I was very surprised Andrew did not offer to look at tapes, refund some or all of his points. As I stated the staff were amazing (especially the valet that let him put his car in their loading zone for the evening beacuase of the size and we did pay the valet fee would never expect not to) and the room very nice, we would have loved to return for another visit but we feel security is lacking and Andrew really wasn't very interested in getting to the bottom of this. I will not stay anywhere I cannot feel safe regardless of how nice and welcoming the staff and the good condition of the room. Also please note the score for service is based on Andrew, handeling of the situation and as far as value i used points, although I do not feel this proprty in anyway represents a cat 6 hotel I have stayed in many Hilton proprties with lower cat. ratings that were beautiful.;1;0;0;0;Zxjq-Rrv0VVdD3vktiDIkw

2685;1/2/2012;fsM4a5kh28SQ34jhkNJvoA;I5YG58v4qi9Yis77RLyErg;Time for renovations. The only good thing about this hotel is the location and the fast elevators. When you step off said elevators you're greeted with worn and dated carpet that desperately needs to be replaced. Like another reviewer said, the hotel is set up in "prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium". This makes it quite loud as you get the noise from the atrium bar.  The suites are small, depressingly dim and dated. The sitting area with no natural light reminded me of a cheap motel. With such a small space, it's beyond me as to why there are 3 sinks. One in the bathroom, one in a wet bar type area, and another free standing sink in the bedroom. There are better ways they could have used that space. There is no fan in the bathroom, so it steams up big time when you shower. (mold, anyone?) The cheap little hairdrier provided barely blows any air. Even the teeny wall mounted ones you find at most hotels work better. The sheets were nice but the pillows were not feather like their website says. Now free breakfast is good because it is free. However, the line for the made to order eggs was extremely long and slow, so we opted for the pre-made. The scrambled eggs were terrible. Powdered, Im sure, but again, free. What got me, was when the egg tray was almost empty, the manager brought out another and then promptly scraped the old eggs into the pan of new eggs prompting noises of disgust from me and other patrons in line. His reply was "What? it's not like people touched it with their hands." Classy. Luckily I paid for this stay with Hilton points. I would never spend real money here and will not be back.;2;0;0;0;qmF64R44N-4gOHqze10TXg

If you are willing to spend the money for a downtown reception- do not book here. I thought since we were the only event that evening, everything would be perfect but they managed to screw up royally by double booking my bridal suit and not being able to raise and lower the lighting.  On a positive note, the wait staff was amazing.  My husband and I were very pleased with the food and dinner service.

Breakfast is always great - though the gal getting the omelets ready to cook needs to lighten up a bit. overall great value!

It is super conveneintly located to where I do most of my business when visiting Chicago and since I left, I keep thinking about how I cannot wait to come back and visit this hotel again. What really got me excited was the interior design and overall elegance that the entire place had.  I am looking forward to the next room I will get at the hotel--all of them are designed and decorated in unique ways with totally different decor. Plus the staff that helped me during my stay could not have been nicer or more thoughtful with basic things like directions.  The only downside to this hotel is that I wish I had known about it sooner!!! Years of coming to Chicago and staying in generic places that are not worth the money at all is a total letdown when you find places like Wheeler mansion that has so much personality and charm! If i was from around here, I would probably come take a look at this place from time to time just for the visual appeal and woodwork, hand carved and hand painted ceilings, stained glass ceiling, etc.  You will be blown away by the elegance and attention to detail that this hotel has as soon as you walk in.;5;0;0;0;gAZVMESj-7Va8zntfZCvNQ

It's really a shame that this woman had such a horrible experience because my husband and I had a WONDERFUL time. I usually don't spend my time writing reviews but I had to get on my soapbox with this one...This hotel is a dream! I can't even comprehend how much detail and effort went into renovating this place. The neighborhood has some of Chicago's oldest and marvelous mansions and if you are a fan of architecture, the Glessner House is right around the corner. We stayed because my husband was attending a convention at McCormick center, but this hotel goes beyond convenience. The service was  A+ and then some. The nice lady at the front desk went above and beyond suggesting some great activities and even a golf course in the suburbs for my husband and his business partner. The city's subway is about a 20 minute walk, but it was a great opportunity to marvel at some of the neighborhood's historic buildings. Chinatown is very close too and we had a great experience at Tony Hu's Lao Sze Chuan. Also a recommendation by the lady at the hotel. (I'm so sorry I can't remember her name! Sorry!) The room we stayed in on the third floor was a-mazing. Sophisticated and very clean, amazing artwork and decor and a super modern, state of the art bathroom.  Well worth it! We will definitely be back next year!!;5;0;0;0;gAZVMESj-7Va8zntfZCvNQ

Despite of all inconvenience I experienced during my stay, including the strike was going on, the toilet was not working and there was no wireless internet access, I was not planning to write a yelp review until The Congress Plaza Hotel Security lied to me:11:45am on Dec 22, 2011, 45 minutes after we checked the hotel, my daughter found out she left her retainer on nightstand in the hotel room. I called the front desk and I was transferred to Hotel Security. The gentleman on the phone took down my information and asked me to call back one hour later. I called the Security at 12:45pm, the person on the phone told me that they could not find my daughter's retainer. I asked if housing keeping had cleaned the room, the person emphasized that the house keeping was in the room while the security checked out the retainer for me. The person even said that the security also checked house keeping's garbage bag to make sure no retainer was there.My daughter was very sure that she left her retainer in the hotel, so we decided to go back the hotel to check out the room ourselves (around 3:00pm). We found out the room was not even been cleaned yet, and surely my daughter's retainer was still on the nightstand.As a frequent traveler, I left stuffs in hotel many times. The hotel staff and the house keeping were always very helpful. I could not believe that the Congress Plaza Hotel could not hold up the basic hotel standard to help it's customers to locate stuff they left in their hotel room.

A group of students and two professors organized a trip to Chicago and we all booked rooms at the Travelodge together. Little did we know that upon arriving they would not have rooms ready for us. After waiting at the desk for about 30 minutes or so we left our bags with the staff so we could all get something to eat in hopes that this would give staff time to get our rooms. We came back after about 2 hours and still nothing so we waited maybe another 1 hour and a half and still nothing. At this point we've been waiting around 4 hours for rooms we reserved. Eventually we just had to find other accommodations for the night. And try and speak to the manager in the morning. Next morning the professor in charge calls the hotel and http://hotels.com to try and organize a refund for last nights debacle.

2702;7/5/2010;OCcUy6pl0EOS-y1GwUzZPA;tc1BwHVv4UhrmbSvegREXA;I checked out a day early and drove 4 hours in the middle of the night to get away from this hotel. This is a warning for you, even if you think the price is good! This hotel is terrible and the photos at their website are grossly misleading. Even understanding that is an old building, that doesn't excuse the other issues going on inside the rooms. First of all, we asked for a new room after being put in a tiny corner room (that looked like a prison cell) on the 8th floor because it smelled so badly like urine and mildew. Our second room (the exact same room, only on the 11th floor) wasn't much better. It was mildewy, but less of a urine odor. To be honest, we didn't spend much time in the room the first day. Here are the other issues with the rooms: the elevators are very slow, the TVs are old and have horrible reception, the air conditioning is via a window unit which barely works and only blows air through the mildew smelling curtains (which you have to keep closed because there are people working in the buildings adjacent), it takes forever for the water to get warm let alone hot, there were dead bugs smashed on the bathroom wall, hair everywhere, mold on the shower curtain and just an overall feeling of uncleanliness. We left early due to the fact I have mold allergies and I began to develop an upper respiratory infection. The manager still charged us for 1/2 the day, but we were just happy to leave. We drove 4 hours back to Detroit to get away. Yes, we left the Chicago Travelodge for Detroit if this gives you any idea of how terrible this place was. (I've never missed Detroit so badly!) The mold is something that is embedded in the carpet, tile, etc. The mildew sheets and curtains could be better if they used better laundry techniques, so I felt that this is just a cheap place to stay. I would never stay here again, or recommend it to anyone.;1;0;0;0;DWRJ-OU-t1Gi1hebNBKMHA

Well it's based on true circumstances. I saw it first hand at City Suites.Boss has the mayor's henchmen do the dirty work for him but the aldermen have to do their own dirty work. It's true. And here's the proof. I was there for the Urban Assault Ride (biking) and I guess one of the aldermen came in the hotel and as a true gangster, he started yelling at everyone right there in the lobby. No pulling anyone to the side. No letting anyone speak or explain their side. He went from 0 to 60 faster than my BMW Z4. For 10 minutes, we were his bitch. It felt like a hurricane hit an earthquake that hit the City Suites Hotel. I didn't really understand what he was saying but I guess the hotel towed his car away. I can't really describe the situation. The best I can do is show you a reenactment of the whole thing herehttp://www.youtube.com/w…Who said that there are no gangsters in Chicago.If you find me dead tomorrow morning with a suicide note next to me, it's not true. There was a hit placed on me.But the train next to the hotel is more noisy than the alderman. You hear "Ding dong. This is Belmont station. We are at Belmont station."

Flat panel TVs, WiFi, spa tub, all upgrades from the big chains costing at least twice as much. Our room was clean, neat, well appointed, quiet and very spacious.  The bed was as comfortable as any hotel I've visited outside of Hong Kong.  Having access and/or the use of a refrig/micro/sink made our stay seem much more relaxing then a standard non-appointed room where running to the ice machine is the norm.  Based on our last stay, this is our new hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.  My only hesistation in not writing this review earlier is that I wanted to keep this new found "best value for the money" find a secret.  Give it a try, and if you find something you want changed, just ask, and I'm sure that the accomodating staff will do their best to resolve your concern.;5;0;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA

Some quick positive tidbits: felt very safe and secure, they had safes in each room, the kithcenette proved very helpful, the water was always hot, asked for some extra towels and pillows, and were delivered to me within 5 minutes, and the rooms were very cleanSome quick negative tidbits: bathroom was a tiny bit crowded (but the shower was very good size), free breakfast was not very good.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was on a budget and wanting to be right in the action!;4;0;0;0;tS1N1-P7QorwyRsNk3VMJA
2709;9/25/2011;-36oGPYRc8k6Oz9M0MfzyA;i1wM_yhz4edPJcWzlX8Qaw;Plain horrible in my opinion. While the staff is extremenly friendly, helpful and professional, my room was clean but smelled like smoke. The lobby is crowed and old. Ice machine on my floor did not work. The restaurant in the lobby is not worth the prize and when I walked around to look for some place to eat near by, everything was closed by 6pm during the weekend. Place was noisy all time around and there is plain nothing to do within at least 6 blocks.  This hotel is NOT WORTH paying $$$ just so you can see the tip of the Willis (Sear Tower) antenna.;2;0;0;0;qgpP1FOFrlssColqP2u-xA
2710;1/11/2012;PVh1XD1ZyZAPUhlev-X6tw;JtN3R5HmOWcbcb5bBSw_9Q;Stayed at this Hotel Indigo (Gold Coast) during a weekend getaway with friends. Our accommodations could not have been more perfect!

2711;3/3/2011;PgXqWAeiguzZJFYTcQID1Q;YcfSEacjvvOu-Qkg9nGTig;I have stayed here now three times over the course of four years and I keep coming back. For the price, it is excellent value. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. The place is bright and cheery. There is something a bit unreal about the "island chic" decor in the middle of a Chicago winter, but I rather like the contrast. The location is very convenient to both Downtown and to the more residential northern and western neighborhoods. The 2-block proximity to the red line is definitely a plus. They also stock the bathroom with nice Aveda products. The only draw backs I can mention are that (1)  the hotel is in need of some sprucing up! It's definitely a bit battered and some new furniture, rugs, and paint would make a difference. When I first stayed here, several years ago, it sparkled. The shine has dulled. But it's still very comfortable, clean, etc. (2) The walls and doors are a bit thin. You can hear everything in the hallway (vacuuming, cleaning staff's walkie talkies, other guests roaming the halls), so if you are super noise sensitive, you might find this to be a problem. (3) The food available downstairs and by room service is not fantastic. But there are several really excellent dining options within walking distance. And since you are in Chicago, you should really be exploring the phenomenal restaurant landscape this city has to offer, not holing up in your room. The bar downstairs is a decent place to meet a friend for a drink, but again better options are nearby, including the cute and cozy Third Coast Cafe, about 3 doors down the street. All said, I highly recommend the Hotel Indigo.;4;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

Their reduced rate was still higher than other hotels in the neighborhood and not worth it. The rooms are very small and neither room we were offered had dressers for clothing, the first room did not even have a closet! The heating system & blowers were so loud and woke us almost hourly through the night:they did nothing to fix the situation and it was truly miserable. If you want food while there, they have it delivered from a mediocre restaurant across the street. Look elsewhere!;2;0;0;0;SEyUJ4t_8K4fD0ZIQnbmrA

2717;6/25/2012;Y1wHcaUczsUDCuYfAL1wIA;tPkRjWhA92ZsTn6H65EWDg;Arrived later in the evening after a long journey to Chicago. Checked into the hotel and given keys to our room. Went up the slow elevator carrying all of our luggage and the keys didn't work. Returned to the desk only to be given bad keys again... Turns out the door was broke so on the third time to the front desk we were given a new room. Second room had a broken shower rod/curtain that had fallen off the wall. Switched to a THIRD room. By this time, we were still not given an upgrade for our inconvenience and it was almost 2:00 (2 hours after we arrived!). Settled into the third room even though the TV did not work and the fruit sitting out was old. Really wanted to like this hotel, but it was extremely outdated and the service was awful. Spoke to management and they were no help with any the issues (and there were a lot). Really tried to give this boutique a chance, but will NEVER return.Great alternative to a Motel 6 or Days Inn. Could not even complete with Holiday Inn... So obviously far out of the luxury category of the Peninsula or Hyatt Regency in the area :( Very disappointed.;1;0;0;0;FfG-PPZCz1sB4SKZoqsZkQ

I had no problems with the staff- everyone was friendly and polite. The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is that my room was freezing!

2721;3/29/2011;EpW2y0l4jNqU-hXEJjUJpg;efSdwm1xrIMXUrRcguto9A;For those of you planning a wedding and considering the Carleton, look no further!  The hotel itself is gorgeous, especially if you consider yourself to be an appreciator of the finer details and have a little vintage in your soul.  The hotel dates back to 1892 and showcases beautiful sitting rooms, stained glass, cast iron chandeliers, and the privacy of your own wing for the course of your wedding.  What's more, the food delivered for the price is incredible.  Our guests had a choice between NY Strip Steak (which I specified at medium rare and which was served at medium rare), Pan Seared Tilapia with kalamata olive and mediterranean vegetable risotto, and a Grilled Vegetable Plate with the most incredible au gratin potatoes.  Everyone raved about the food and I frequently heard, "this is the best food I've ever eaten at a wedding."  My husband and I both value the quality of food highly and were worried that our insistence on a sit down dinner would break the bank.  Not so here.  We chose a Sunday in March and the sales/catering manager Anne Parker was open to negotiation.Speaking of Anne Parker, I cannot say enough good things about her.  She is warm, kind, sincere, and very good at her job:in other words, she has all the qualities you want in a planner without hiring your own.  She arranged our tasting, linen selection, and even recommended an outstanding florist (who did the flowers at her own wedding).  She was always available and in touch, and the lines of communication remained open all the way up to the wedding.The Carleton is located in Oak Park, IL, a suburb that boasts the vibe of a quaint, small town and that comfort and boutique quality definitely translates to the hotel and its accommodations.  The restaurant in the lobby is excellent and breakfast at Poor Phil's (on the Marion Street side) is absolutely delicious!  The rooms are clean, well, kept and nicely adorned (albeit slightly pricey even with the group rate).  Want to watch the budget and offer rooms to guests?  The Motor Inn, despite the unfortunate title, has been completely rehabbed and the rooms are excellent and well priced.All in all, we had an amazing wedding--not just the day itself, but all the phases leading up to it--on account of the Carleton and its team of dedicated staff.  Once we had decided the venue, everything fell naturally into place.I highly recommend it!;5;0;0;0;SNuJYJewLhunxlhEezo15w

2727;7/18/2012;8gU__YTlZ5e308khm4gO6w;2BmqiEQLhLQ-Ysd89Af-UQ;Yes I am giving this place a 4 star review. No, not because it one of the nicer places I've stayed but because of the whole experience itself. Yes, the elevator is a tad sketchy being the fact that it takes an unusual amount of time for it to even start moving once youre in it. But i did have locks on the door and while being peg-legged the receptionist was very friendly, let us look at the room before we checked in and let us know what we were in for. I did put my own sheets on the bed and wore shoes almost all the time. I liked the charm of the place plugs cut off of all the electrical devices in the room and all. My only complaint I have about the place is the creepy guy who lives on the 14th floor right around the corner from the room we had and right across the hall from the elevator...he likes to sit with his door ajar on a chair in the corner of his room only wearing his tidy whiteys and just stares out the door. While being creepy he didnt bother with us at all. Some might say it was not the safest decision for 2 eighteen/ninteeen year old girls but was the only place in/around the city where you didnt have to be 21 to check in and was at a decent price and its nice they dont jack up the rates for Lollapalooza like every single other hotel/motel in the area. I would recommend Tokyo Hotel to a person whos willing to experience something a tad out of the ordinary or if youre just as broke as I was and desperately needed somewhere to stay for a weekend.;4;0;0;0;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg

But the toilet was very clean and the staff were friendly. It's quite an experience and it's something to tell your friends about later.;1;0;0;0;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg

She insisted that it already WAS checkout time (once at 9:30 am, and again at 11am - checkout is at noon). The staff downstairs were generally friendly and helpful - moreso the guys outside than the ones at the desk. The hotel itself is great. Clean, modern, toiletries are top notch, and the location is incredible. The bed was comfortable, and the in-room seating was very cool.

Check-in at the hotel was easy and smooth.  When we got up to our room we were SHOCKED to discover we had been upgraded to a penthouse from a regular king room (lucky break for a couple celebrating their anniversary!) The room was bright, clean, and well furnished.  It is clear that the hotel will be in need of renovations within the next few years but it was still a lovely room and for the price, it was more than was expected. Our only complaint would be that our neighbords were playing their music VERY loudly in the middle of the night and we could hear it almost clear as day.  However, we called the front desk and security had handled the situation within 10 minutes.

2736;7/6/2009;89ni;FmLuaYcjhRpgYsTqlSzhZw;Stayed here recently for a trip to Chicago to celebrate our anniversary and the Fourth of July.  I'm going to say that, dollar for dollar, this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at in recent memory.  Ended up paying around $130 a night with taxes for a room on the 21st floor with an amazing view looking North out to Lake Michigan. Room was very comfortable, loved the bathrooms, spacious, bed was perfect, and the furnishings were stylish.  Only a few minor complaints - could hear people/thumpings/etc. through the walls at night, didn't really bother me but it did the Mrs. Location here is great - red line subway a few blocks away, and all sorts of pricey shopping if you're into that sort of thing.  Bar scene at night was bustling, though I wouldn't recommend many of the bars, unless you want to rub elbows with graphic t-shirt douchebags.  Gibson's steakhouse across the street was really solid, and there are some good quick places to grab breakfast if you don't feel like springing for room service.   Just like all the reviews have noted, the staff here was incredibly helpful and polite.  They helped us book a river cruise and answered numerous other dumb tourist questions.  When I made my reservation a few months prior, I explained it was for our anniversary - and upon our arrival we received a personalized note from the manager and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  Obviously, the Chicago hotel market is very competitive, and this place understands that guests appreciate a staff willing to go the extra mile.   Again, I've been at nicer hotels, but if you are into value, I don't think you can beat Sutton Place.;5;2;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2737;11/2/2009;N4ltHYQhZlW3oGk0E3kp-w;Q3n_EpLCR_gMhlFOxk77Zw;I stayed here this past weekend and had a very nice night. My friend was visiting from out of town for Halloween and we wanted to get a hotel for the night. Our plans were a little last minute and I was super worried about finding a reasonably priced hotel. Luckily, Sutton Place was running a $99.00 sale for the night!!! Jackpot! You couldn't ask for a better location. Sutton Place is close to so many restaurants, the bars on Clark and Division, and shopping.  A cab ride from Union Station to the hotel cost around $7.00. Everyone in the hotel was friendly and you could tell they actually cared about our stay. The rooms were so quite, we literally heard zero noise from our neighbors. And, our room was right next to the elevators on our floor and we still heard no noise! Perfectly fluffy beds, I had the best night of sleep. My only complaint is that there are no ice machines. You have to call room service to deliver you your ice. So essentially you have to pay for the ice (since it would be expected for you to tip room service delivery) But, it just get a pain to keep paying for new ice once the ice melts...;4;1;2;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

I checked in about 11:00 on a Sunday night and the front desk was barely helpful.  I understand it was late but I felt like I was interupting them.  However, the weekday staff was AWESOME! I brought my PS3 consule (yes, kind of dorky, especially if I want to enjoy the area, which i did).  I wasn't able to hook the PS3 up to my TV on Sunday and the staff said there was nothing they could do....like I said, they were busy doing something else.   The next day, I asked the front desk and they were extremely accomodating.  The hotel "engineer" came to my room within minutes, realized the TV wasn't compatible with a PS3, called the front desk and asked if I could move to another room.  Within 20 minutes I was in a new room on the 21st floor.   The bellman brought the key to me and helped me with my bags.  The engineer hooked up my PS3.  They bent over backwards to make me happy.  Too bad the late night weekend staff wasn't this accomodating or I would have gave a 5 star rating.;4;2;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

2742;10/29/2010;EoeBwtKnOKdcOxhEGuJnGQ;TPLIBORUhcBXSctWAWmzjg;I was in Chicago in September with my mother for a mother/daughter Oprah weekend.  Once I was 'Oprahed' out, which didn't take long I had the chance to enjoy this quiet and contemporary hotel.  I don't know if we obtained a killer deal but the rooms were not all that expensive, the bathroom was huge with a gigantic tub and a separate shower, I love a separate shower.  I believe this hotel used to be the La Meridian, but I could be wrong.   The rooms were large and the beds were comfortable, the sheets were a little scratchy I don't know if I have become spoiled but I was expecting nicer bedding.  The staff was wonderful and very friendly.  The hotel is located off of Rush Street in the Gold Coast area, which I have heard awful things about.  It really wasn't that bad, I was there during the week so the weekends may be different.  The shopping in the area is very high end along with most of the restaurants in the general vicinity.  All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Davenport even with my crazy Oprah loving mother and her friends, I would stay here again.;4;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2743;8/8/2010;3usfRCq8DHSrq2VOp8rsxg;B5mpfVCviyUl9Bsdef5jUQ;This place is in a really nice neighborhood of Chicago.  The outside of it has many restaurants where people ate outside providing a great atmosphere at night.   There were only 2 elevators, which weren't very fast.  The rooms were clean, but some of the stuff is really dated (the tv was CRT).  Also, the room wasn't very spacious.  The sitting chair is quite upright, and not comfortable to sit for extended periods (nice to look at tho). The good stuff is that they provide an umbrella, robe, bathroom is really nice (tub and shower - NICE), great toiletries, and the bed linens were quite nice.  It is a great business hotel, and if you stay here, you'll feel pampered.  The front desk staff is really nice, the doormen are also very nice.  The Sutton Place comes recommended.;3;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2744;11/8/2011;DFWTHFdWYX49FHoD02FuPg;w1U4L8_Nn5tmkTdA6U5_xw;I reserved a block of rooms for out of town guests for my recent wedding. The hotel staff was really great to work with. Rosie contacted me a week or so before the wedding to make sure she had all the info to pass on to the guests. I was a little concerned the suite I booked would be too small for the bridal party to use to get dressed so I e-mailed Rosie, she said she would make sure I was put in the largest junior suite, no problem! The room was beautiful and plenty spacious. The guests loved the location. I think it has a perfect combination of boutique/smallish feel, without seeming quaint or shabby. Would give 5 stars if the price ($179 per night) could have been knocked down just a bit! Otherwise, no complaints.;4;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

The decor is modern and hip.  The staff is very discreet and accommodating.  The prices are reasonable.  I have had some good times here.  Went to a wedding here once and the ballroom was awesome. Ceiling to floor glass one floor above Rush street.  You can look right down and see everything and everyone on the busy Rush Street and they can look right back at you.  Being right across from Tavern and Gibson's with the Whiskey Bar in the lobby (sort of)  you don't have to go far for anything.  Hot hotel, Hot location, Hot views, this is a great place to put friends, Family, or yourself!;5;3;2;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2747;2/3/2011;rip4ySX9HVAvAUTAAMYQpQ;T_TvazKNJdhcvAwYlBRhpg;We used Sutton Place hotel for our wedding reception venue and it worked out really well.  Anna, the event coordinator, was fabulous.  Working with her was like having a wedding planner.  Can't say enough positive things about her, but having people like Anna to work with in the stress of wedding planning is a lifesaver!  I could never thank her enough. The venue itself was great, too.  The location  is unbeatable, and the discounted room block rates were affordable for our guests.  When the dance floor was down and the room was set up, it really looked less "hotel-like" and more unique.  Plus, Sutton Place uses Flour, Cake, and Pastry for the wedding cake and those ladies do some fabulous work.  Overall, it was a great place to book our event and I'm glad we chose it.;5;1;1;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2748;12/8/2009;p1j61QqXvZp896Z8rdzSwA;qKVLocEUZUvceYXkiFX9BQ;This place was decent.  I found out after arriving that this hotel is right in the center of the infamous Viagra Triangle.  AWESOME!  Needless to say, this area wasn't exactly my type of scene at all, but it wasn't bad and the location was pretty good for getting to other places.  The staff was great and the hotel itself seemed pretty nice, but the particular room we got was kinda lame.   The awesomeness: - Nice and competent staff. - Clean & fairly upscale. - Convenient location for getting to most things in downtown Chicago and the North side of town.   - It was a fairly good deal on Priceline.   The suckage (in no particular order): - Lack of power outlets.  Really, there was maybe one free... - Really bad sheets.  Not the most comfortable and they just would not stay on the bed.  Had to put them back on every night.   - TV was pretty weak.  You'd expect a place like this to have a nicer, newer TV.  It's not that important though.   - Really poor lighting.  This was a bizarre one - it was a very dark room even with the lamps on (there was no overhead lighting).   - Terrible shower.  Those detachable showerheads are fine if you can put them to a regular shower height and use it like a normal showerhead - the highest the showerhead went up was to my chest.  Is this shower for leprechauns?  In addition to the height issue, the water pressure kinda sucked.  The shower itself also seemed really plasticky and cheap - not in line with the quality evident in the rest of the hotel.  And what's up with the handrails everywhere in the shower and near the toilet?  Is this a handicapped bathroom?! - Wonderful 5th floor view of the shit-covered roof next door.  To be fair, beyond that was a decent view of a big department store (Barney's, I think) - Room was across from the maid's closet.  Awesome! It'll probably look like I'm being super picky but I'm really not.  I'm easy to please when it comes to lodging.  Basically, I don't need everything to be fantastic - I just need everything to not suck.  The hotel just came up really short in a lot of very basic and simple areas that you normally take for granted.  And even with a decent deal through Priceline you are still paying a good bit of money to stay here. Maybe all their rooms are kinda sub-par like that - I don't know.  I'm wondering if maybe we got a crappy room because we went through Priceline.  Maybe they just have a shitastic room they keep reserved for guests who go through Priceline.  Who knows. Anyway, aside from the location (which ended up being pretty convenient for getting around), this place didn't display a lot of impressive qualities and lacks in some very basic areas. 2.5;3;4;0;1;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2749;8/27/2005;kIuhUO1FVSv6o8ev-L5X0w;OlhH_-yyVWU6jj8H2TMSiQ;This fine property is in the Gold Coast/Rush Street area. The hotel is not that large as far as number of rooms, yet it is contained in a glossy highrise. Its nice rooms have a cool and contemporary look to them, and each bathroom has a bathtub and a separate glass shower stall. The modern lobby is smallish, but perhaps to push you towards its extremely popular Whiskey Bar & Grill.;5;2;1;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

The room was adequate, but not special in any way. There was a whirpool tub and a shower stall. The shower stall was very tight (and I'm slender!), but the water pressure was amazing. Some rust on the hinges in the bathroom and discolored rubber molding in the bathroom showed its wear and tear. I have not seen a TV that old in a hotel room since the 1990s. The beds were only double, while the industry standard is now queens. If you asked the right question you received internet access for free, otherwise there was a daily fee. A decent place to stay all-in-all, but not as good as I expected.;3;1;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

It is a very modern hotel with comfortable beds and the bathrooms are big. They have a nice walk in shower and a big oval tub as well. Last time, I stayed at the Sutton Place I also tried out the fitness suite, which was small but got the job done. It has 2 treadmills, elliptical, bike and a couple weight machines and free weights.  It was actually crowded in the morning hours.  The location of the Sutton place is fantastic. It located in what most people from Chicago call the "Viagra Triangle". It is steps away from many restaurants. My favorite place is Lou Malnati's for pizza.  I also like to stop at Mr Kites chocolate shop  to get some S'mores and Mountain Tops! I highly recommend stopping in and getting some chocolate!  Overall I enjoy the Sutton place and look forward to visiting Chicago next month.;4;1;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

THE BAD The TV's were awful. They are the old tube kind, big and bulky. It reminded me of the kind you see in a motel. I brought my ps3 and could not hook it up because it was blocked. The Internet was way too slow, I tried to download a TV show fro iTunes and it literally took my 36 hours. There are no ice machines No in room coffee makers (they do offer complimentary coffee in the lobby until 9:30 but every time i tried to get some it was EMPTY! and if you try going closer to 9:30 the hot water for tea will not be hot) Terrible water pressure in the shower The bottom sheet on the bed kept coming off so I would wake up with my head on the mattress.

2759;6/30/2008;eoAKsUF5spNHIwbH-HlDuw;Soafvih5HKR7JaG2_u8zTg;We had our wedding reception here in May 08 and from Day 1 of the planning (Feb 07), Sutton Place went above & beyond my expectations. Personnel: Paula, the catering manager, was amazing.  She was willing to accommodate any suggestions I had and worked wonderfully with our vendors.  She is so responsive, and truly cared about making the day fun and memorable for everyone. Other hotel staff was very friendly, without being fake (you know the type).  Everyone we encountered, from the wait staff to the valet parking staff, was so courteous. Rooms: We had a penthouse suite (bi-level with fabulous city views) that was a great size and easily fit 10 girls plus hair stylists & a makeup artist getting ready pre-ceremony.  We also had a hotel block here for guests & all were happy with their rooms (small touches like the fresh orchids in the bathroom went a long way!) Logistics: I love the set up of the space (2nd floor cocktail hour with a private bar and 3rd floor dinner/dancing).  The unique shape of the rooms makes it interesting and the floor to ceiling windows offer a great view of the activity on the street.   Food: We received so many raves about our food!  I honestly didn't get a chance to eat much of it (although at the tasting, everything was delicious).  The portion sizes were very generous.;5;1;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2760;7/18/2009;KAtS;KMMcgp2nLfx32e1G6SCS3g;I'm not the type to stay in nice hotels. In fact Motel 6 will generally suffice:after all vacationing isn't for sleep. However, having been here for only 2 days I can already see why this place is as expensive as it lists. With a Internet ready business center, gym and a very attentive staff, you'd think you didn't need anything else. Well they have a swanky bar attached for some good night life.  I was thoroughly impressed with the entire stay and would recommend this to anyone in the Chicago area.;5;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

I have no idea what anyone is taking about with the bathrooms being outdated. The bathroom was very nice. Huge soaking tub and separate shower. In fact, I think the bathroom was bigger than some of the hotel rooms we had on our honeymoon in Italy. Okay, well not really, but it felt like it. My only complaints are that the place was a bit cold and the people at the front desk were less than friendly, but those are two things I am more than willing to deal with.;4;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

I was on a higher floor per my request (the 19th floor), and the bed faced a wall that was a complete floor to ceiling..wall to wall window! So cool!! The bathroom was spacious, clean & inviting with a deep full length bathtub and a stand alone glass shower. The modern vanity area was stocked with complimentary toiletries & a sitting chair for primping and grooming yourself in front of the mirrored walls from all corners! The room had a well stocked mini-bar, complimentary, shoe shine service, and wi-fi Internet for a fee.... of which I used none.   The only issue that kept me from giving a perfect 5 star rating was the bathtub needed to be rinsed lightly cleaned before I would get into it. And I saw a hair that did not belong to me or my husband. This let me know housekeeping did not have a great cleaning day that day, (I am very particular hotel room bathroom & bedding areas) but OVERALL the room was clean & neat. ADDITIONAL INFO: My stay was prompted by the purchase of a recent Groupon deal. I treated my husband to a night out to dinner and an overnight stay. It was a very nice room for the Groupon price of $159 (normally a weekend room of that grade goes for twice as much..) My deal included half-off valet parking ($22.50) and a Continental breakfast at the hotel's Whiskey Bar Restaurant;4;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
2766;3/15/2011;Y7ItIhlVoMfopHDDDVtFrw;gRpsGDju3cnmheJJ6V4gBQ;My fiance and I stayed at the Sutton this past weekend 3/11 - 3/13.  Although the location was great, our biggest issue with Sutton Place was the overall service, and the valet.  There were hardly and bellmen present to help with bags, and doors were not automatic.  When employees at the hotel saw me struggling with my bags and trying to open door, no one offered to help at any point in time even though concierge was present.  As for the Valet, it was a complete disaster.  We would call 15 minutes in advance from our room for our car and be told it'd be ready in 15 minutes.  We come downstairs and ended up waiting 20-30 minutes in addition to the 15 min heads up we gave the concierge.  This happened on 4 occasions throughout the weekend.  Each time we called down for our car, we would end up waiting another 20-30 minutes in the cramped lobby.  I would expect when parking is $45/night, the time it takes to get the car would be more efficient.  We were late for multiple engagements because of the timing of valet even when we gave advance notice.  This seems to be a recurring issue for the hotel as they are not staffed properly in this dept.  Also, the staff that was on hand was not friendly or helpful.  Valets/concierge did not open doors or assist with luggage to and from car.  Overall, our stay at the Sutton place was a stressful and uncomfortable one. Will never stay here again.  Much prefer the Sofitel a few blocks down the street.;1;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA

2768;12/9/2007;oiOrcegZfau;m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag;Here is a genuine find for a semi-tight-fisted tourist like me... I've never stayed in the Lakeview neighborhood area before, and I liked it. There are lots of fun places to eat and shop but still close enough to the Red Line for all the other Chicago attractions. This Best Western hotel was a terrific find for me since I was less than enthralled with their more generic and congested River North hotel closer to the Loop. That was full of college kids with hefty backpacks on weekend benders. This one attracts more of the middle-aged set who roll their suitcases from the cab. Oh wait, that would be me. It's a Georgian-style boutique hotel with a very friendly staff. I paid $150 per night for a nice-sized room with a king. It was very well maintained, and the "Do Not Disturb" sign actually seems to work in the morning. I never went in for their continental breakfast because hell, I was just across the street from Ann Sather. Besides, those early-rising Europeans beat me to it anyway. It takes about twenty minutes to walk to the Belmont station, which is on the main artery of the CTA since the Red Line goes up and down almost the full length of the visitable city. I'd definitely come back here in the summer months when the stroll is a bit more bearable.;4;12;7;5;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ

Disadvantage: The bathroom in the lobby is locked, so you have to sweet talk the key from the desk clerk while doing a song-n-"toe dance" to make the point that you really have to go.;5;8;3;8;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ

Anyways, I did some research and found this BEAUTIFUL hotel online and I couldnt have been more pleased with the room (except for maybe the view of the parking garage next door, but I didnt even really care about that).  It's soooo nice with great location in Lakeview and the staff is so super friendly and helpful. Funny story - my mom and sister were waiting outside for the pizza delivery guy and my mom saw two guys walk by holding hands.  Being from the suburbs in Texas, my sweet mother thought it strange.  My sister said "did Carri not tell you about this neighborhood?" and when my mom looked blankly at my sister, she told my mom that we were staying in the gay-berhood.  Totally thought she was going to have have a heart attack.  She really is a nice lady - I should have just given her a warning or something. Back to the hotel - dont let the name fool you.  This is like no Best Western you've ever stayed in.  It's elegant and classy, yet comfortable.  I highly recommend.;5;5;3;3;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2772;11/11/2008;fpRWSIBmBQOSE86xVs4z0A;Axmb-4Nl2W4J_vfCItilvw;This is a really sweet little hotel. There isn't anything flashy or fancy about it, but its in good condition and the people are very friendly. Since my family lives a plane ride away, and my apartment is very small, they end up staying in this hotel whenever they come to visit because its amazingly close to where I live. The hotel books up really far in advance in baseball season because it is the closes hotel to Wrigley (about a mile), and good luck getting a room whenever there are Pride events or Lakeview/Lincoln Park festivals. But, they are very accomodating of special situations (like my graduation from grad school). For people visiting Chicago, I would really recommend this hotel. Its far enough away from the touristy areas that you get a good feel for a Chicago neighborhood and its a block from the express buses that run down LSD, as well as a mile from the red line. Definitely the nicest Best Western (Bestest Western?) I've seen.;4;5;3;2;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2773;8/17/2009;lFSwuu0SvJREqPJqofCjdg;kiT7A29JZj2awLwrLj19qg;Great location, friendly staff. My boyfriend is in Chicago for business and I tagged along. We only stayed one night, but the front desk staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was clean, our shower was HUGE (we might have gotten a handicapped room, but that was sweet!) and we got complimentary water bottles. :D Continental breakfast was acceptable -- the cinnamon rolls they had smelled delicious! Only downside to our stay was a noisy neighbor who was yelling curse words for about two hours at midnight...and that we had to pay $22.00 for the day's parking.;4;2;1;0;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2774;10/7/2010;oR6sV7Z;eyx42e79U0UEIqWabS1GEA;I miss this hotel. My wife and I will never forget our stay here from September 22-25. I just hope that we've been forgotten already (I explain later). +Great location. As Joel A. mentions, the hotel is near Lincoln Park, the red "L" line, and some nice restaurants (I reviewed Chili Mac's recently), bars, and shops. My wife and I went to Chicago to see the Cubs play (we love Bay Area teams more, but have been fans of the Cubs for years), and Wrigley Field is only a 15-minute walk from the hotel (after you exit and head left, you simply turn left on W. Addison St.- Wrigley is about 12 blocks away total). +The front desk employees are helpful and friendly. The guys especially made me feel comfortable (they're a bit more casual and approachable). +Some supplies are available per request. I stupidly brought shaving cream, but no razor. I knew that the hotel was going to provide me with a cheap one (oh yeah), but at least I was bailed out (we met up with an old friend of mine on the 24th, and I think his cute little girls would have been scared if I looked like Bigfoot). +There's a nice computer by the front desk. Guests are only asked to use it for no more than 15 minutes (in general, the computer should be available). +Continental breakfast is served from 7-10 am (I can't comment on it further, as my wife and I always slept in). +The area outside is very nice, and the hotel as a whole is pretty elegant. +The soda and snack machines. Most of the snacks I bought were only $.90 each, and my cans of soda were only $1 (you'll be charged more at most hotels in CA). +Their English is limited, but the housekeepers work hard and are friendly. +The ones at Embassy Suites are bigger, but my wife and I liked our suite. It featured 2 flat screen TV's, a nice desk (we both loved the office chair), a comfortable couch (I'm surprised that I didn't find myself sleeping on it), and 2 beds (we slept on separate beds, but cuddled and watched TV from mine). +Check-In is at 2 pm, and Check-Out is at 12 (I view this as a positive because some hotels want you to check-in at 3 or 4 and check-out at 10 or 11 am). +The air conditioning unit in our suite was loud, but easy to operate (my wife saw the panel on the wall before I did- prior to this, I was unplugging the unit, pressing all these buttons, and getting ready to kick it).     +/-The lobby is a little small, but nice. The chairs are large and comfortable, and there's a painting that looks like it should be part of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion (the tree and body of water look dark and spooky). My wife kept telling me which one was "right," but there are 2 doors to enter and exit. -Our suite was a bit pricey. We were basically charged $206 a night. -There are no hotel shuttles. Taking a taxi to and from Midway International Airport cost us $80 total. -The bathroom in the lobby is locked (this impacted my wife and I to some degree). I understand, as it's only meant for guests (as Michael S. mentions, the hotel "is the BEST and ONLY place to use the bathroom in this part of Lakeview before 7 am"). Still, I hate asking for bathroom keys.   -The hotel is tucked away. It's easy to pass it up if you're driving there and not familiar with the area. It's also right next to a brownstone (I quickly got used to it, but the view from our windows was less than stellar). -There are only 4 floors and 83 rooms (the hotel is long, but not wide), and pets aren't allowed. I advise booking your room months in advance, at least during baseball season. -It's nice and somewhat spacious, but my wife and I only noticed 1 elevator. -There's a fitness center that includes a Whirlpool spa tub. There's no swimming pool, though, and room service is limited (I didn't even know that there was any until now). -The toilet in our suite was weak (we had to report this twice). I had an accident on the night of the 22nd, and it took awhile to clean up the toilet bowl, floor, back wall, and tub (the towel on the tub was beyond saving- no, just a tiny speck landed on it). Anyway, the toilet wouldn't flush right from the night of the 23rd on (this really didn't have to do with me). On the 24th, a guy named Manuel worked on it (I felt sorry for him and the housekeeper when they came in- they quietly talked to each other a little in Spanish), but the plunger he had was inadequate (he needed a Snake). On the 25th, I left a nice mound behind, and my wife made her imprint felt too (we weren't descriptive at all, but the looks we got from the front desk employees we talked to were priceless). All in all, it was a real crappy situation.     Needless to say, my wife and I had an eventful stay (if we ever book a room here again, we'll arrive with plungers in hand). The hotel has a lot of charm and some friendly and understanding employees.;3;8;10;6;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2775;9/10/2005;5fKGXRVdV5DlESL5uN2Sjg;BI4lPhrUpmEySIJUywjIjQ;IT's in a great location and when I had friends visiting and I couldn't host all of them - they stayed here and got free passes to my Bally's which is right next door.  So, it was nice - we got to spend quality time while on vacation working out, too which is usually something that most ppl miss out on when they're on vacation.;4;0;0;0;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2776;10/17/2010;SaZZ2i8VZjF4DhnzdI6F;L-jmGQ4nz-Jqll4Fax22Qg;I highly recommend this hotel if you don't need to stay downtown. The rooms are very nice and we loved the neighborhood.  It's close to the red line and you can walk to lots of restaurants right from the hotel.  I was pleased & surprised to find that our room was very quiet at night. I only have one criticism -- there is breakfast but no designated breakfast room.  If you don't want to eat in the lobby you have to take your food back to your room.  However, this is a minor inconvenience -- plus, there are several good places for breakfast a block or two away. I would stay here again & I've already recommended it to friends.;4;0;0;0;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2777;4/19/2010;tb-4JfyUDxK7ADPPSfsTyQ;DpDBhscQUfJ_vp5fKPDxQQ;First I travel 50+ nights a year so I see and experience the full spectrum of hotels. We picked this hotel which is blocks from our house to stay in with our dog while we had some home remodel work done. I have had my mom and aunts stay hear so we have used this before. Staff is nice and the location is great. The down side is the cleaning people do not clean. When we checked in and opened a dresser we were suprised to find condoms,lube and a dirty towel. NEVER ACCEPTABLE. My dog did not want to even stay in this room and we all moved after sticking it out for two nights and were unhappy. Request to stay in the new part of the hotel and experience will be like the higher rated reviews;1;0;0;0;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ
2778;7/24/2012;LsdkQTEI;8frJvzVcQXp9HBBptJpTHw;Nice property. Slammin' breakfast for a hotel complimentary meal. Incredibly friendly staff. They seem to know where everything is. Comfy beds. Pretty decently priced which is astounding.  Love the kurig in the room. Nice TV's in the room too. Walgreens right next door to buy your CTA cards and if you get here before 6 on a friday I would suggest hitting up the cute little cupcake store right next to the Madison st. entrance. It's super cute. Free wifi with great connection. I can really only take one star for the location. It is right next to an L stop but on the weekends there is nothing open on this side of town and the L lines that go to that station are only open until 12 so if you are a night owl like me you will end up spending some dough on cabs. Not their fault but definitely a downside. I would stay on the Mag Mile next time even though i despise shopping and that area in general. I also wish they had a mini fridge in the room. We left enough food at every place we went out to eat to half of the hungry in the city. Plus it would have been nice to be able to chill the drinks we brought into the room.;4;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2779;9/15/2012;xwPz1fh0txzpK2uche1QSA;Lphk9zHHC3GoeaH6Ep4vLw;We tried to stay here for our anniversary. We stay at LaQuintas frequently and are members of their rewards club. This time our experience was dreadful. There were some young women in a room across the hall partying loudly. We called twice to complain. The first time nothing happened. The second time security came, but as soon as he left, the party started up again. So we packed up and checked out. LaQuinta had obviously decided which customers they wanted to keep. So, the formerly loyal customers are sitting in Union Station waiting for a train. Thanks for giving us a memorable anniversary night, La Quinta.;1;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2780;5/31/2012;nBtiIsrZ3aktNy0l3szUcA;8LmOQogm-QRtSA-UL4z2zg;It surprises me how many positive reviews have been posted for this hotel. I've stayed at this inn on five occasions and have had a negative experience each time. I won't be back. This particular La Quinta fails miserably on so many different levels. Here are a few of them: BUGGY WEB SITE SCREWS UP CHECK-IN DATE:  This topic requires an essay of its own but the short story is this:  In certain circumstances, the web reservation system will incorrectly modify your "check in" date -- moving it forward by one day versus what you actually entered. I was bit by this bug twice. NO WAY TO MAKE A TRUE "RESERVATION" AT THIS HOTEL: My reservations are frequently missing from La Quinta's computers at check-in time, despite having received a verified reservation confirmation number from the hotel via automated email. What this means is that your "reservation" isn't really a reservation at all. There's a 30-40% chance that when you arrive at the hotel, your reservation number will be "unrecognized." You'll still be ok if there happen to be some rooms available when you show up at the front desk but if not, well, you're just out of luck. NO WI-FI: The hotel claims to offer WiFi but good luck getting it to work. Upon connection, a standard "terms of use" page appeared but clicking "I Agree" just led to an error message. This occurred on my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone. The good news is that the aforementioned bug was fixed on my last visit. I was finally able to connect to the Internet -- but at an extremely low data rate. Bottom line: Be prepared to use your 3G phone. WiFi borders on useless in some rooms and is non-existent in others. ALLEY-FACING 'BAIT-AND-SWITCH' ROOMS: Recall that there's a 30-40% chance that your reservation will be "lost" when you try to check in. See above. The receptionist at the front desk will then see if she can find anything that's available. The "only thing available" will inevitably be facing the alley. The great thing about these alley-facing rooms is that at 4:45am each morning, a garbage truck will provide you with a friendly wake-up call consisting of incessant ear-piercing scraping and banging. And it is very very loud. It doesn't matter if you're on the second floor or the ninth floor. It WILL wake you up and you WILL be startled. Every time. Learn to love it. CLEANING STAFF: Cleaning service begins at 8:30am. The loud slamming of doors and yelling and laughing amongst the cleaning staff marks the beginning of cleaning time. You can't miss it. If you're still in your room at 8:30am, you can put a "do not disturb" sign on your door. In any other hotel, encountering a "do not disturb" sign indicates that the cleaning crew should come back later. Not at La Quinta though. At this place, if they encounter a DND sign in the early morning (e.g. 9am) they'll slip a little note under your door indicating that they're not going to clean the room at all and if you have a problem with it, you can visit the front desk. Not so great for guests that aren't early risers but that's ok because it's more convenient for the cleaning staff this way and in the end, that's really what counts, right? HYPOCRITICAL GREEN POLICIES: The first thing you'll see when you walk in the room is a nice little laminated note wherein La Quinta pats themselves on the back for trying to save the planet, tries to opt-out of providing basic services like clean linens, and gives you specific instructions you can follow if you actually want your room to be appropriately serviced. Being green sure is hip. La Quinta takes this hipness to a new level by providing only a thimble full of shampoo and not a single glass. What they do provide instead of clean glasses, however, is a set of six styrofoam cups -- each one individually wrapped in its own layer of disposable plastic! Wow. That's very green. WHAT THE @#$ IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE?? : I've often wondered how one hotel could be so messed up in such a diversity of ways. I wondered why the clothes drawers are only a few inches deep -- so shallow in fact that even if you're that midget from "Game of Thrones," there's not enough room for you to stow a tiny folded sweater. I wondered why, during my last stay, I had a bathroom that was constructed in such a way that there's a vast chasm between the toilet and the toilet paper roll. I could go on and on but I think the real source of the problem is that the hotel owners and management haven't taken the time to actually stay here and "test" the place. Not all La Quinta Inns are this bad. But this one in Chicago is a uniquely bizarre trainwreck. It could be fixed if someone cared enough to do so. BETTER ALTERNATIVES: Changing my routine is never easy. But this hotel is so disappointing that I've been forced to give up in disgust. I walked around the neighborhood last night looking for potentially better Chicago hotels that I can patronize. Will try Marriott or W instead.;1;3;1;4;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2781;3/11/2012;UFCX;QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q;I stayed at La Quinta last night after a long day in the city. Upon arrival they couldn't find our reservation and didn't quite treat it well. In the end, they did find the reservation and were apologetic. Alls well that ends well. Our room was on the 9th floor and a smoking room (gross) but the hotel was sold out and the smell only lingered a little bit. The room was beautiful~this isn't your usual La Quinta. It was quite large and spacious with two double beds. The bathroom was also very nice with a see-thru shower...OooLaLa. I liked the shade covering the window (see picture)...it made the room seem a bit chic. Tons of cable channels, nice working coffee maker (since some people noted it not working). Free breakfast from 7-10am. The parking lot next door is crazy expensive so I suggest parking in the Green City Parking lot but you'll have to be out by 7am which will mean no soup for you!;4;1;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2782;7/11/2012;Wd8BYV8mltmLj3r0zx0jZQ;y-j9Lzl1dDHBgzdYoDG6JA;The Hotel is in an excellent location. It is near everything in the Loop. The staff was very helpful. It was a 30-40 minute from O'hare Airport. The hot tub was small but it still served its purpose. I would stay there again. Also shout out to Mike who was working security a couple days. He deserves a raise lol.;4;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2783;6/1/2012;IOe6TDcKL-jQZ;S7H5ZJ1DT0CIVtMQYkkfuQ;I recently stayed at the La Quinta on a recent business trip. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised as my only experience with the La Quinta brand are the road-side hotels-more-like-motels establishments. Upon arrival I was greeted by a bell hop who guided me towards the front desk. I did not have a wait upon check-in and within a span of 5 minutes or less was checked in and in my room. The rooms are adequately appointed, not opulent or awe inspiring, but most decidedly functionality. I found there to be ample closet space, working space and bathroom space. However, the set up did trigger one of my biggest pet peeves about hotels and that is there were an insufficient number of outlets. To plug in my phone charger I had to maneuver my way beside the in-room refrigerator and then pray the cord reached to the nightstand. Of course it did not and so I ended up using my laptop as an extension cord. Anyone who travels for business and prefers to use their phone as their alarm clock will find this annoying. Unlike some of the other reviews I did not encounter any early morning noise but I did hear a family complaining in the hall when they, upon entering their newly assigned room, found that it was already occupied. I also was able to access the internet without issue. The complimentary breakfast was actually quite nice. I would definitely stay here again when traveling for business.;3;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2784;11/28/2011;-qCY-tJUQbJWWayqhrvDAg;hLW3dVKQEHeoXTPB6uGbxA;I stayed here with my boyfriend in January during a layover from Nicaragua. Thank goddness for the super cozy rooms because it was freeezzziinnngg outside (oh, and p.s. I'm from Cali, so I'm a strictly warm weather gal). Perks: Nice, comfortable beds with fluffy pillows and soft sheets. Clean, modern room. Free breakfast and shuttle service to/from the airport (although keep in mind: the shuttle only leaves once every hour). And the staff was very friendly. Would have been nice if there was more in the area in terms of food, drug stores, liquor stores (mmmm red wine), etc. But overall a great and affordable place to crash for a chilly layover.;4;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2785;6/20/2011;DpPveXPL7zcQ7U7-c1WS9w;fJhQQKVrq2z_01PVEEDW4g;I booked this hotel through Hotwire for about $150 a night, after tax, for a weekend stay. The Hotel had no parking, but there is a garage next door for $34 a night. We just parked our car in Bucktown on the street for free and road the train in. We liked almost everything about our room. The beds are very comfortable. One issue we had was the amount of shampoo we were given. Only one little bottle compared to normally getting shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. The maid didn't even give us a new bottle for our second night. The other problem with our room was the view, or lack there of. All we could see was an alley filled with dumpsters and trash cans. It was loud early in the morning when the trash trucks came as well. One big advantage to this hotel is the free hot breakfast. It was very crowded, but the dining room and staff seemed to handle the crowd efficiently. The front desk staff was helpful as far as directions and very friendly. Overall I think this is a nice hotel for the money. I'd stay here again.;4;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2786;2/8/2011;IVvQ5h8Vh6zeVVPiTZ5BOg;zssRyoiDuTa1zyQd5fRx2w;Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Room was clean and well decorated. Bathroom was more unique then most hotels and where there was not carpet there were hard wood floors! very unexpected. Very Quiet, Definitely Located in the business part of Chicago. Got a Shedd Aquarium VIP package with room and the overall price was fantastic I almost felt like I was robbing them. Hot Tub and Pool were small but no one was using them anyway so there were no complaints. Breakfast Buffet was I have to say the best I've ever had in a hotel before (and free). Wide variety and the wait staff took very good care of everyone. I had a good time.;5;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2787;4/6/2012;UrJ7Vh;pMflEx98szIXBX6AQepnrg;Be prepared to be jarred awake by the super loud noises of emptying dumpsters at 3-4am every night on the two sides of the building facing the alley. The mattress was below average quality. There are many other much nicer places in or very near the Loop at this price point. The "breakfast" is only served until 9am. There were a few nice attributes but not worth mentioning in light of the extreme noise.;1;1;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2788;11/26/2009;yDQJ6j;k4e_w7fwb3xkFliAM815PQ;Am staying at the Inn for a couple nights over the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend, 2009. In fact, am writing this review from a table in the 2nd floor's continental breakfast area.  The view of the surrounding downtown buildings on this gray, soggy morning is wonderful.  The food at the continental breakfast, not so much. The eggs are disgusting, they actually smell and taste like pancake syrup, which, since pancakes are not being offered, is hella scary. The bacon is crispy, a good thing.  Plenty of bagels and you toast your own. You can also make your own waffle (too much trouble for me to go to at a hotel when I don't make waffles in my own house). Now for my room. It's quite large, nicely appointed with modern minamlist decor, large bathroom with huge shower. Pluses:  36" flat screen HD TV:full cable line-up:refrigerator I've now stocked with my own bottled water and diet sodas:nice decor:lots of fluffy feather pillows:free WIFI:plenty of drawers for clothes and deskspace for working:plenty of hangers in the closet. Minuses: Very stingy on the complimentary toiletries - two butter-pat sized bars of soap and one thimbleful of shampoo.  What ever happened to shampoo and conditioner and a little container of lotion?  Not to mention the shoe-buffing cloth (not that my shoes need buffing, but they make great lens cleaners for sunglasses). The water never got quite hot enough for my liking in the shower.  The AC/Heat system doesn't respond very well. I like it bone-chilling cold when I sleep at night, but the thermostat wouldn't let me lower the setting any lower than 65 degrees, and it never ever got below 67.  In the morning, I crank up the heat when I'm dressing, so I set the thermostat to 72 degrees.  An hour and a half later, the air temp had risen from 67 to 69.   Biggest complaint:  the hotel advertises they have safes at the front desk for locking up valuables.  That's not quite true. What they do have are safe-deposit boxes, the long skinny ones that you find at banks.   I found this out on my way out to dinner last night, when I took my netbook down to lock it up, since I didn't want to leave it in my room.  When I asked the staff member at the desk what other recommendations she could give me on how I could secure my netbook without having to carry it around me at all times, she said to just leave it in the room.  I don't think so. Biggest compliment so far:  Very cool decor.  Think Design Within Reach meets MOMA meets the Ikea look.;2;1;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2789;9/27/2010;4;w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ;Now that's better. This is my second time staying at La Quinta. Room: Spacious, with an LCD TV and a workstation. The beds were average, but they did their job. The bathroom was nice but the shower was awkward. The glass was transparent. FAIL. The glass is supposed to be translucent, of course I was in the bathroom by myself but the glass (and mirror) took forever to steam up. It would have been one thing if the mirror wasn't in front of the shower but it was. I felt so weird showering. Pool and other amenities: There was an indoor pool, but Chicago is a pretty chilly place at the end of September. You really don't need to go swimming. (And who goes to Chicago for the pool in their hotel anyway?) The "continental" breakfast had eggs, bacon and sausage. Now THAT'S what I call a breakfast. Not waffles, fruit and assorted breads. Location: LOVED it. It was in the heart of Downtown/The Loop. I was in walking distance to State Street! There's also a Walgreens, Dunkin' Donuts, Jimmy John's, Starbucks, Chipotle and several other regional chain restaurants all right outside the front door. Miscellaneous: It's right next to an eL train station. It's pretty reasonably priced for a hotel smack dab in the heart of Chicago too. Had a great time staying here. Would definitely consider using this hotel again, if it wasn't for the self-voyeuristic shower.;4;1;1;4;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2790;5/28/2011;KVhBZxsHCQOqa9hUp6wlFw;Z0z63jBiAIzPfhTjT6ORxA;OK for a few days, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to stay here again.  There are plenty of other hotels nearby.  Cost is certainly less than some others nearby, but I might be willing to pay a little extra for a better experience Highlights -Convenient location -Argo Tea located right downstairs, with an entrance from the hotel.  Plus additional restaurants & coffee shops nearby (Note:  Many of restaurant close early since they mostly cater to the business lunch crowd) -Modern style -Continental breakfast -Free wifi Negatives -I'm certainly not a clean freak by any means, but the room wasn't nearly as clean as I expected. The housekeeping team would stop by at 8:30 to ask if I wanted my room cleaned.  I would say yes, in hopes that it would actually be cleaned, but not so much... Some of the towels were stained which was pretty gross. -Like another person mentioned, the Keurig coffee maker didn't work.  It was covered in dust, so that probably should have been my first inclination that it probably hasn't been working for awhile.;3;1;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA

We got our room for $120/night on Priceline (for 2 double beds) and were impressed with the modern and stylish look of the decor. The bathroom was great- amazing glass shower with plenty of room for two people. We had a flat screen TV, free Wi-Fi, desk, and a great view of Chicago skyscrapers. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable! The room was quiet- we never heard our neighbors. We appreciated that the front desk staff asked us to show our room keys before entering the elevator ever time we got back to the hotel. I imagine this keeps out the "riff-raff". The complimentary breakfast was sooo good- waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs, bagels, cereal, etc. All of the staff we came into contact with were polite and friendly, especially the breakfast room staff.

2794;7/5/2011;oU5pSCdRJaNSAIhv9C7pIg;lcBihhJUiv1czKy0y6xpzg;I am giving this hotel a full 5-star rating.  While I have stayed at more luxurious hotels, this one really exceeded my expectations.  First, the location: FANTASTIC.  A short walk (less than 2 blocks) to both the metra train station and the Chicago el subway train stop.    Second, the hotel itself is extremely well run.  Nice front desk staff.  Rooms are very clean, and modern.  There is a pool and hot tub on the first floor, which is a nice touch when travelling with kids.  I would have gone with 4 stars but after enjoying the free HOT breakfast every morning, I had to give them the full 5 stars.  Price was unusually low for a Chicago hotel. Tremendous value, and we will only stay at LaQuinta when we return to Chicago next time.;5;0;0;0;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2795;10/9/2009;C6Jp-ibG-VUW5xMD8K1DNQ;aG5wA5leHLj3jZEn0n2Hjw;I'm writing this as I sit on a friend-of-a-friend's couch.  Why?  Hotwire didn't make it clear enough that in the state of Illinois, you have to be 21 to check out a room.  I booked my reservation more than a month in advance, but upon going to the front desk, they informed me that I couldn't check in to my room.  After asking the dude at the front desk if they could make an exception--he promptly snapped at me and said that I should leave.  So, in a city that I don't know, 30 degrees, and no friends in the city... he threatens to call security if I don't leave--"no exceptions".  After a half hour of calling around, I got a hold of a friend who told me that his friend would let me sleep there for the night.  It was a 45 minute walk-subway-walk to his house... and here I am.  Thanks la quinta... I would never recommend that anyone even consider going here.;1;4;0;4;PyG0aSX3pBx0hzoSH20FnA
2796;5/26/2012;j37QlZcPCjt-tn3q7LtvHg;Ta8k51OmOFnjfIrH3-er9Q;We chose this hotel based on a combination of location and sale price, and could not have been more pleasantly surprised. Should we ever return to Chicago we will most definitely be staying here. The rooms are delightfully furnished and decorated - none of the tired, drab and faded decor we would expect from a hotel in this price range. The entire place has this charmingly David Lynchian lounge atmosphere. Just across the street is Lincoln Park and Lake Michigan. We found the surrounding neighborhoods excellently suited for walking and architecture viewing. Oh, and the restaurant downstairs? Heartbreakingly good food.;5;4;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA
2797;9/3/2012;BV8lDgAmlDoP4SWPW2UcWw;EdIhpWoLivhqBH8l7ZQr-g;My husband and I just enjoyed a great stay here over the weekend. We got a good rate over the weekend from Hotwire. The room is big enough, though by no means spacious. We had a view of Lincoln Park. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the toiletries were awesome. The flat screen tv seemed to have some issues with some channels, but we weren't there to watch tv. Front desk is definitely chaotic. We tried to check in about 45 minutes before check in and were told our room was not ready. However, people after me were able to check into their rooms. I get that we paid less, but it still seems insulting that you will give other people a room before me. Also, I called for a recommendation on where to get a massage and I am pretty sure the guy was googling it on the internet. It took about ten minutes. I can look stuff up on the internet, I was wondering if your hotel had a spa they had a discount set up with (or better yet, a masseuse who would come to my room!) You can't beat the location and the room is just as nice as any other hotels in the area. We would definitely return.;4;0;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA

The beds were comfortable and the bathroom fixtures and toiletries tops.  I can see why people have said the rooms are small -- and if I did not have the suite, I may have removed a star. I also enjoyed the cute neighborhood - a bit outside of the main city bits, but close to lots of fun spots, including Second City - another Chicago must.  Plus, the park is just across the street.;4;2;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA

While I haven't actually stayed at the hotel, everyone from sales to the bellboy were courteous and attentive. I'm sure my guests will be happy with their stay this summer, and I can't wait to see what the roof deck is like this summer. The views from each room of the park and the lake are amazing, I can only imagine what it will be like from the rooftop! I stopped in the coffee shop attached to the lobby and had a delicious cuppa. The publicist for the hotel happened to overhear me ask the barista what exactly the hotel was going for with their design choices. From the outside, I was expecting the hotel to be somewhat deco. Upon walking in, I realized it's anything but. I think she described it as collegial eclectic, which they really achieved by getting most of their common room decor from various places throughout Lincoln Park.;5;2;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA

Also the connecting restaurants and coffee bar was great! One key thing to note is the staff was really nice and the decor of the hotel was amazing. Also it is located in between two of the best neighborhoods in the Chicago area Lincoln Park and Old town. You cant go wrong with this hotel.;4;1;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA
2803;7/22/2012;7UUNk4R2DTJx-xIxiEK1Ng;rx-wamBpVt03YxjTdCsh1A;Very cool hotel with a great decor. As another reviewer commented, it reminded me of Mad Men as well. We booked a Jr. Suite and were upgraded to a family room (2 rooms - jr. Suite with adjoining room with bunk beds, own tv and bathroom).  I almost felt guilty about all of the space. Comfortable bed:) The staff were helpful and fun. Loved the uniforms! Attached coffee shop was good. Drawback for me was that the rooftop wasn't open, so there wasn't a bar. That is why it wasn't five star for me. I like to come out from the evening and be able to have a drink on-site. If you plan to hang out in Lincoln Park, location is awesome. Short walk to the zoo, great restaurants and shopping. If you are planning more of a Michigan Ave., museums, Navy Pier, etc... The location isn't ideal. Will definitely stay there again when visiting my niece in Lincoln Park.;4;1;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA

2806;5/27/2012;UrRU7nOtZ5pwH3xsbbxN3Q;cUc70yzgh09GcXGqoqWBdQ;My husband and I stayed here last week for two nights then again last night. This is a funkily redone Days Inn. Sixties/Seventies decor. Very, very comfortable beds. Extra thick and absorbent. We stayed in a Jr king suite which had two bathrooms ! The fitness center is a bit dreary and they could add some 2 and 3 pound weights for us old ladies who like to travel and work out. We stayed here to see our son at Second City so it was an easy walk to the performance. Old Town was great to stroll around at night.  The room was quiet. No city street noise because of the neighborhood. However the people in the room next door had a dog who was noisy some of the time.  They have been open two months do have some kinks to work out. On our return visit, the room did not have cups in the bathroom and some soaps. Also a chair was missing.  It is not luxurious, so not five star, but at a discounted price a good, quiet place to stay in a good neighborhood in Chicago.;3;2;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA
2807;5/31/2012;c-G2iC8QojK3q-yg71MYag;wHvO5kK43yjqkcQ4HdtNAQ;The room was very spacious:two beds plus a little couch/seat things. And we were able to fit another roll-away mattress. There was an iPad available for you to request housekeeping or bathroom toiletries. Some of the complimentary toiletries were pretty awesome! Such things included women's deodorant, feminine care products, nail polish remover pads (airplane friendly!), nail files, soft contact solution, and others that you'll probably never need. Location was key, staff members were friendly and accommodating, and the hotel was definitely very modern and chic looking. The lounge also provided complimentary continental breakfast for patrons of the executive floor. The breakfast was actually well above a typical continental style:in addition to the regular toast and bagels, it also had a medley of fruit, oatmeal, cereal, and a cappuccino machine! I also love the way the lobby smells like white tea and jasmine upon walking in (which is what the shampoo and soaps smell like too);4;0;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

SWEET!   The room was comfortable, clean, and more spacious as I had imagined.  There was an iPad for which I could request items from housekeeping rather than calling the front desk.  Complimentary items that I could request included the norm - toothpaste/toothbrush, but also deoderant, contact lens solution and feminine products?!  COOL.  Only feature missing (or maybe I didn't find it) was the option to check out on the iPad.  Downside, no free in-room WiFi but they do have it in the lobby.

2810;5/27/2012;Oe8m9cW0j7iviOcUtwRtUQ;y8tkRSUOGo0V7HeiAVOwOA;Great location right on the river. They told me the hotel used to be a Hotel Nikko which made the lobby decor make a lot more sense. It's a better than average Westin, plus the location makes this a good deal. I was there for a conference and the downstairs conference rooms were terrific and the catering was better than average. The only disappointment was the restaurant which seemed disorganized and not well run. Food was not interesting. There was also a sushi bar in the lobby and while I was there I never saw more than one person eating there. You have to wonder about that... There are way better dining options within walking distance.;4;0;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q
2811;8/21/2012;NFNEBJslX0sBQhE19VaZ1A;sfckpl0P0dROkotxOoHRmg;My wife and I reserved the River North Westin for our wedding suite and our wedding block for our out of town guests.  While negotiating terms of the wedding block, were were told (in writing) that the bride and groom's suite would be upgraded if there was availability.  We were ultimately placed in a small suite with windows facing an alley.  It was hard to believe this was the "Deluxe" King Suite we book, yet the upgrade we were told we would receive upon availability, but after mention to the bellhop, he took care of the issue and made sure that we got upgraded to an awesome suite.  Kudos to him. The major star deduction comes from how the staff handled an incident after the wedding. One of our wedding guests helped bring back a few of our personal items from the wedding reception to the hotel.   These items included a large Nordstrom bag and two box fans (it was really hot) which were left in the lobby bar with all the other guests as everybody wound down the evening.  My wife and I weren't told that these items were left in the bar, and we didn't know to grab them, so they were left after the bar was closed, by ourselves and several other wedding guests.  We have pictures from that night of these items in the lobby bar and inquired in the morning if they had them in lost and found (we were the last people to leave the bar).  Management and security said that they did not have them so we asked if they would review their security camera as a large bag and two box fans don't just walk away.  We received the run around from them many times and were never able to secure any footage.  Multiple people also called while we were on our honeymoon including mother, mother-in-law, and maid-of honor, but they were unable to make any progress as to where the bag of valuables and box fans could have disappeared to.  We have subsequently filed a police report which in attempt to file a claim with our homeowners policy. One would think that the River North Westin would try and take better care of their bride and groom who reserved a wedding block at their location.  I've always been extremely pleased with Westin's in general but am extremely sour after this latest experience.;1;0;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

Overall, a very nice property - I'd return.;4;1;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q
2813;12/9/2011;f-XUQrHplFhr;RIHOg7O6zyZySfJui-Anmw;Very disappointed with this Westin because of their reputation and I usually have great stays at their hotels. I stayed at this one for a night downtown with my fiance. The location is great and the decor is exactly what you'd expect from a Westin. The woman at the front desk was very friendly when she checked us in. We ate at the lobby restaurant, which was a HUGE disappointment. Our waitress was extremely frazzled and kind of made us uncomfortable because she was going 100mph and blaming others who worked at the lounge for how long it was taking our food. Originally we sat off to the side because no tables were open (we were joined by a friend for dinner) and the waitress approached us and we told her we'd like to wait for a table to open up. We saw one open and she said it wasn't in her section (we thought "so what?") and then told us she'd clean off a table in her section and then proceeded to seat us there. We ordered off the sushi and dinner menus. The sushi was a huge disappointment. I was expecting really original, creative rolls but there was nothing too extraordinary. It was good, but I'm not too picky. I've definitely had MUCH better sushi. My fiance ordered a spider roll (he gets one every time we get sushi) and barely touched it because he said it tasted awful and was the worst spider roll he's ever had. Off the dinner menu, I ordered the ratatouille ravioli and my fiance ordered the pork chop. My ravioli fell short of my expectations. My fiance's porkchop was bland, the "fries" that came with it were dry and the brussel sprouts... oh my goodness. Like I said, I'm not a picky eater, but I took a bite of half a brussel sprout and wanted to spit it out. It was awful. My fiance was in a bad mood after dinner and said he wouldn't mind spending so much money on food if it was actually good. After we checked out the next day, I realized I left a pair of heels in the room. We called and the hotel said they didn't find any shoes but would let us know. I thought the service would be better that whoever cleaned the room would've notified someone and then we would've received a call, but I guess not.;3;1;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

You know the old attage about saving a penny every day? You probably need to save like $5 a day to afford this place. Yes, very posh very nice but the location is not everything because you can walk about 4 blocks and get to the Marriott. The hotel is a little off its rocker when it thinks you WANT to get your eyes ripped out of your head just to stay there, but it's probably one of those places that the boss gets to stay at with the family while we toil in the mines. At least this place didn't stick me with ridiculous charges. I earned those badboys.;3;4;0;3;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

Other then that Chicago ain't bad in the winter on a clear sunny day. Staying at the Westin also makes it so much more pleasant. Especially at the Club level. The door man is bundled warmly and the front desk are very helpful and the concierge was nice enough to recommend a 'walk about' route. The Club level room is palatial with a sitting area and an abundance of hot water for a bath after your 'walk about'. I gotta find out where the doorman gets his hat.

I asked them to check it out while I was out, came back and they either didn't come up or whatever they did didn't work.

2823;2/17/2010;gFUyUo8cHJSBH9LKYx3Pzw;8d36keo3PhL85C0DkZbaOg;My boyfriend and I treated ourselves to a mini-weekend getaway here this past Valentines Day weekend we left feeling relaxed and restored. I first found myself at the Westin River North in May of 2008 because my sister set up a block of rooms here for her wedding. We stayed in the bridal suite and it was pretty s-w-a-n-k-y. The view of the river was gorgeous and a wonderful thing to wake up to on her wedding day. Anyhow, I digress. Back to my stay this past weekend. We checked in on Saturday afternoon and it was quick and simple, we were up in our suite on the Executive Floor within 5 minutes, now that's efficient! Our suite had an iMac, a giant king sized bed and a nice view of Marina City. We decided to really indulge and order room service (we had dinner reservations at a nearby steakhouse). After calling and placing our order, the food arrived in the exact amount of time they told us it would arrive...to the minute. Impressive. And then, 15 minutes into eating room service called us to check up on us and inquire if everything arrived as we had ordered it. The checkout here is quick too, they have an Express Checkout option where they slip your bill under your door and you can enclose your keycards into the same envelope and drop it in a box at the lobby. No fuss checkout is always a plus isn't it? You obviously have to pay for any charges not on the bill -- but since you sign all your purchases (food or services) you are aware of it in advance. In. Out. And relaxed, thank you Westin River North....;4;3;1;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

I knock a star for the smell in the bathrooms. UGH. It wasn't just in my room. A friend of mine who happened to be attending the same conference had this issue too. Nothing really made it subside.

I was very excited that I was able to coerce room service to make me breakfast despite the fact it was very, very past the official hours of eggs. The bedding was like a magical cloud I never wanted to get out of. The only downside was the computers downstairs that charge by the minute. One froze on me, kept charging me all the while, and once I finally got a manager to come and help me, she was incredibly rude, and tried to claim it was my fault.

2827;6/12/2006;sCbVlJODbG5Up6PIDc0j7w;d89lBbUnlyrOZkC29K28zw;The RESTAURANT & LOUNGE at the Westin The lounge area of the Westin has a refreshing combination of sophistication yet informalness. You can sit in the lounge and order cocktails from the bar or food from either the main restaurant or the sushi bar. This is perfect if you are in a group that can't decide what they want to eat. The Pamatini martini is excellent. Their banana "cheesecake" dessert is not a cheesecake at all and is excellent. I have enjoyed all their food. I definitely recommend their lounge for an after-work hangout or weekend dinner.;4;1;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

2832;10/4/2010;SBsMNjCGK7Kd;kAFewF0csObwxSs-63YdkQ;Nice hotel. Pretty good service, but their food was below par for a Westin. We were there all week. The room service (I ordered stir fry) food was cold and salty - had to send it back. The banquet food was good except the meats - dry. We had to wait 40 minutes for sushi in the lobby, and so on.

2833;4/5/2010;I;hQYc90YPvI5WAhxUF4Bo5Q;IT'S TRUE..       TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.... Just like people, some Westins are uglier than others. Luckily, this Westin was of the pretty varietal. Smack dab in the middle of Downtown, it was close to everything. As 'Preferred Guests', we were greeted and instantly upgraded to a corner room with a sick view on the 12th floor. We overlooked the Chicago River with the sun beaming into our room.The room had a king Heavenly bed (which can be had for $1695 w/ boxspring..tempting!), chaise by the bow window, these light green leaf soaps, and girly smelling shampoo/conditioner. Artwork with its own artist light dresses the room's walls. A sport bottle of water comes complimentary, as does Starbucks grounds.  An LG 32" LCD is placed smack middle in front of the bed. The highlight for me? A Speakman DUAL SHOWER HEAD. The cool feature is that not only do you get a greater surface area, but you can turn off one head by pushing a back valve on the left showerhead. There was great water pressure and I never ran out of hot water. Service was friendly and professional. We were even given an umbrella for usage during a rainy day. $49/day for parking is a tad ridiculous though, don'tcha think? (MINUS ONE STAR) Didn't get a chance to hit the gym, as I was busy pigging out. At $109/night, are you kidding me? GO! Pics: http://www.meetup.com/fo…;4;1;0;1;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

2854;8/21/2010;5zYltrQLqNZecyKUzuSr9Q;e6UL6lDHAw9P06k-EXqj_w;This is the best hotel in Chicago.  I've stayed at the Park Hyatt, the Peninsula, the Drake, the Westin - and this by far my favorite.  Part of the "Small Luxury Hotels of the World" group, the Talbott fits the luxury bill without draining the wallet.  Centrally located in the Gold Cost (close to my office, Equinox, Exhale, restaurants and shopping) and across the street from some of the best cupcakes in Chicago at More, the Talbott has beautifully appointed rooms, and a staff that makes you feel at home while traveling (Robert and Stacy are wonderful). There are no words to describe how comfortable the beds are at this hotel, and I'm a huge fan of the Molton Brown toiletries they provide.  It's also great that they offer a free guest pass for workouts at the Equinox at 900 N. Michigan Ave right around the corner.  The Talbott is not only my favorite hotel in Chicago, but one of the best hotels in the US that I have experienced.  You definitely will not be sorry if you make this your home in Chicago.;5;2;0;0;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w
2855;1/25/2008;X9Kq3N0Ku;jzwS0Nife68IdNjdlWmuXQ;So they apparently finished the renovations as I've stayed at the Talbott 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months and everything has been near perfect. The bar is back at the front of the hotel, it's clean, it's attached to the restaurant and they serve a mean Ketel One Martini. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times. Our server, who's name I really wish I could remember, took great care of us. I always ordered something from the nightly specials and it never disappointed...and he always suggested a great wine pairing. From the menu, we had the Beef Carpaccio one night, which was excellent. The best part of the stay, though, was the hotel itself. When I hear boutique hotels, I think small, but the rooms were excellent sized - bigger than the last Marriott I stayed at - and the bathroom is much nicer (and bigger) than the one at my house. Lots of marble, rich fabrics, pillows and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Plenty of space for working. Warm and inviting - it was almost as nice as being at home. Reasonably priced for a downtown hotel, within walking distance to a few other restaurants, a Starbucks and my client's office. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat...;5;1;0;0;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w
2856;11/21/2008;7WvGVG6P4jyuzXKvZHETxA;3uJLBIQSjY2UfscuQhZGvw;Nice, clean, and upscale. Neat decor, very old school, lots of fancy wood trim. I booked a group of my employees in there for a mini-conference. All loved their rooms, and there were no problems with our meeting room. The hotel bar worked excellently as a place to stop in for a nightcap, and everyone's room had a mini-bar. The hotel does want an exorbitant fee for internet access from a meeting room. That was a disappointment in this age of free wifi at every coffee shop in town. Even a modest fee would have been fine, but they wanted $400 (per day) for six of us to be able to connect to the wifi.

Nice touches - elevator only allowed access to the floors with your room key:filtered water dispenser on every floor with new bottles for you to fill and go, great for us summer tourists. Front desk personnel very pleasant and helpful.  During checkout, manager directed me to self-checkout machine, and guided me through entire process.  Not necessarily more efficient, but showed their willingness to make the process easy. Price was incredible.  $112 ($130 with taxes) through Hotwire, for a summer night right in the heart of the action.  Past stay at similar time cost $150 + taxes at a tiny, tiny Red Roof Inn off Michigan Ave.  Or you go you big and drop a few hundred at the name hotels.;5;1;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

The little bar area included a coffee pot, refrigerator and a microwave. They have a filtered water station with free empty bottles in the hall near the elevator. The elevator is programmed to go to your floor with your plastic room key - safety in mind. They have a dedicated computer in the business office for printing boarding passes. Small lounge area on ground floor. This hotel is 5 blocks from the Clark cta station on the Blue line coming from the O'Hare airport (cta fare was $2.25 one way at this writing). I spent most of my time out and about town and the room was fine. My only quirk was that the shower water wasn't exactly hot nor was it cold. When I checked out, I mentioned it to staff.

This time I was given a room with a river view on the Club Quarters side (sister hotels, same building, one reservation, could end up at either) and overheard a front desk agent tell someone that usually CQ is for their corporate/business travelers and the River Hotel for the public.

Only reason for the one star is free internet and free water bottles to fill up otherewise I would say negative and never coming back here is my answer. First off the employees are rude. We had booked for non smoking but we got smoking in a tiny bedroom that reeked I seriously thought if I stayed there longer than the amount of days I did I would have gotten second hand cancer in no time. I went and asked for the staff to spray it down or do something he just waved me off without even asking for the room number I was staying in. I even went out and bought a can of air freshener after day 2 it ran out from my many attempts to "freshen" up the place. There was a DRIED UP BOOGER on one of our towels (gross!). not only that but there was stains all over the carpeting literally looked like someone had took a big dump on the carpeting all over the place. Trust me I will never come back even if its free and suggest people to stay away.;1;2;0;2;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2866;7/27/2011;xt8JZ2n;nQG7XkgrsG4MXXXfexJwAA;The Chicago River Hotel is an excellent boutique hotel.  The location is outstanding, it's across the Chicago river and about a half block off of all the shopping that is the Magnificent Mile. The hotel is also within walking distance to a plethora of great restaurants, and Millennium Park.  If you're taking the "L" from O'Hare, the walk from the Clark/Lake station is about 10 minutes while pulling a suitcase in the summer (no clue what it's like in the winter!). The room was clean, well appointed, and nicely maintained, although the TV was pretty small.  A really nice touch is that each floor has a gratis self-serve water bottle filling station:the water is chilled and filtered, they provide the bottles, all you have to do is fill 'er up! We booked their smallest room which was more than adequate for our needs since we were always out, and saved us more than enough money to pay for an awesome dinner and drinks.  While the hotel may not have as many amenities as other larger properties, it's still a winner based on cleanliness, location, price, and free Wi-Fi.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.;5;1;1;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2867;6/23/2012;o2n9j6OiRrzKww;JVAhrWZFvx_UT2F-C_XZyQ;The location was excellent and close to major tourist sites. We had a room facing the buildings to the back of the hotel, which we didn't mind because it seemed to "buffer" the noise level. It was a great historical building, which usually indicates small rooms. This was expected..but was surprised by the minimal housekeeping. We stayed a week and some days the room would not be cleaned up until 3 pm. I don't think they ever vaccumed the carpet while we were there. It took them 5 hours to get us a roll-away for our daughter to sleep in the first night. The staff was somewhat helpful when we asked them a few questions about how to get to the orange line to get to the Mid-way airport. The restaurant downstairs had good food, but a bit pricey I felt for the portion size. Checking in and out was really fast and they stored our luggage for several hours on the last day. The bathroom flooring did have a "urine" smell to it. I believe someone in an another review also had mentioned that as well. The filtered water/water bottles was a perfect addition. We had a few days where there was not enough warm water when showering in the morning. I was shocked to find out that this hotel throws out all the plastic/paper and does not recycle anything. I took our empty plastic bottles down to the street side recylce bin myself. In all it was a good location for the money.;3;0;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2868;7/21/2010;CqUp-tsZ2eFmvyLgWqX7QA;-Vu7L3U7-kxDyY1VHxw3zw;When I'm on vacation in a new city, I only sleep in hotels, I'm not there for the amenities so I can only comment on the room and check in/check out process. We only stayed in Chicago 1 out of 3 nights, the other 2 we actually stayed in Indiana and drove into IL (it was a poorly planned & spontaneous trip, but it actually worked out). The $70 Indiana hotels we stayed in had much more comfortable beds but ($219) The River was extremely clean and the staff were very polite and professional. Transformers 3 was being shot right outside the hotel and it was such a surreal experience, as we were walking to the valet station, we had to walk trough the set - there were overturned vehicles, ash covered streets, collapsed buildings - it was like walking through an apocalypse! There were some angry Brits yelling at the front desk about the noise and streets being shut down, but it wasn't their fault, the hotel did everything they could to make a pleasant experience out of a minor (okay... major) inconvenience.;4;0;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2869;5/8/2011;UFhv0EaGxa96pSjr8vWFbQ;U1e7IE9A_358yG4pNBjmMw;Not too shabby! Last time we were in Chicago, we stayed at the Conrad. The prices for the rooms were about the same, but the Chicago River Hotel has an awesome location- right by the river and Michigan Ave. We were only a few blocks from Millennium Park, steps away from the shopping, and close to the metro. As I booked the room on their website and made the reservation, it said that the room won't actually be charged to my card until we physically arrive and check-in. However, a couple days before our arrival I noticed the charge to my credit card. When I called in to inquire, the first guy who I spoke with was rather rude, and argued with me, saying that I must not have booked on their site because they don't take the money out until check-in. He put me on hold, and I was connected to a manager, who was extremely nice and apologetic. Seems there was some problem with their site. He assured me that my request for a room with a nice view would be waiting for us upon our arrival. Sooo fast forward a couple days, and we get to the hotel. We check in, I speak with the manager I spoke with on the phone, everything seems fine. We get up to our room and we had problems getting the room key to scan in the door.. this actually happened EVERY single time we wanted to get in. It took on average 5-10 scans before the key would be read each time. Imagine our frustration. Anyway, the room was nice enough and modern, but it was DINKY. Super small. I'm guessing it was this size because it was a corner room, but it was definitely narrow. Our view was nice though, of the river and buildings across the way. One morning when we were heading out, housekeeping was cleaning some of the rooms on our floor. The doors were open, and what we saw were much bigger rooms, but they didn't seem like they were suites. Is it wrong that after the problems with the room charges to my card, I would expect them to do some nice gesture for us to make up for it? I dunno... I think I'd rather pay a little more and get a bigger room somewhere else.;3;2;1;1;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2870;7/6/2011;tNoj-p2RTdwGIyDk-0sDtw;W3pB9iiIEkkCjX18gtYnMw;This hotel was amazing.  It sits at a great location, you walk out the door and you get a great view of the river front and buildings all around E Wacker and Michigan.  The amenities inside the hotel are pretty thoughtful too: every floor has a water purifier water and water bottles that you can fill up yourself.  At $139 a night it was a great deal for something with a great view and being inside the loop.

I don't care about the small size of the rooms, as long as they are affordable. The liberty office chairs are very comfortable. Two suggestions: Everything that I needed was in the room except a cork opener. The hotel should provide a better body wash. The soap leaves your skin very dry.;4;0;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2872;8/7/2010;C4xoPdyPMYxXgvHHiGZtnA;pwYYEGzk4KUU5fGxju41ew;A damn nice hotel for a reasonable price.  Rooms were very nice... they seem to have been recently remodeled and were also very clean.   The bathrooms were also nice.  Some have complained that the rooms are small, but they seemed fine to me.  Plus free computers and printing.;5;0;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg
2873;9/11/2010;m-Udfi2OBGG1eHHx1F8TRg;yJARwEegZ-pGt6wXG-YhbA;The River Hotel is definitely geared toward the business traveler:if I am not mistaken I believe this hotel also operates as a Club Quarters location.  Nonetheless this hotel served me well during my weekend stay in Chicago.  I found hotel to be central to the activities which I planned.  A brief walk northbound will lead you to the Magnificent Mile and a brief walk southbound will lead you to Millennium Park.  The hotel itself definitely had a mature clientele, no ruckus or wayward people which was ok with me.  My room was awkward. Clean but very awkward.  I think the hotel did a really good job of trying to make the room as comfortable as possible, however it was pretty clear that guest rooms have been converted.  My room was not particularly large but again the hotel did a really good job of trying to accommodate guest.  There was a nice desk area that would serve the business traveler well.  A mini-fridge and microwave was also on hand.  The bed was not remarkable, but it was clean.  My only true gripe about the River Hotel is definitely the bathroom.  I am a woman:so bathrooms are important.  Not only did it appear as if this bathroom was converted from a former closet, there was no bath tub.  It's not that I wanted to take a bath, I just like to be able to distinguish my bathing space from the rest of the bathroom and this was not possible with the shower stall which was provided.  If you are just looking for a place to set down your belongings and beat the streets...this hotel will serve you well.;3;1;0;0;t5JK4OZzCuetIrJXdHLntg

2875;4/23/2012;TEmnUaNcm0koqIT1cGr41g;oLBIcBRD30rmqn09xFgQfg;I used the Crowne Plaza as the host hotel for my wedding at Loft on Lake.  Location-wise is was great  for that venue, although less fun if my guests wanted to explore the more touristy things in Chicago in their free time.  It's also right off 90/94, so guests driving in from out of town can find it pretty easily.  Despite looking pretty drab from the outside, the interior is actually pretty inviting. Lena in the Sales department did a great job reserving blocks of rooms for the guests and responding quickly to my questions and requests leading up to the big day.  The check-in staff were able to hand out welcome bags that we had assembled  upon checking in.  Pricing was pretty good given their location. Overall the out of towners were very happy with the place. Important things to know -  parking is pricey valet only, although there are cheaper pay lots nearby too.  Restaurants nearby are the ones in Greek town or the one in the hotel.  I had the breakfast buffet in the hotel, which was good, although it was your typical fare at typical hotel price (some of my guests had breakfast vouchers). We had a 2 room suite for the bridal party, which was spacious, comfortable, and modern.  Family liked being able to run across the street to Dominicks for snacks and food for the room while everyone was getting ready. Overall I was very happy with the service and accommodations here.;4;2;0;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2876;5/2/2012;PdXPDvNU1VDC9SGXy6eePg;PdpWp_j67Nfr_oQF-4yKUw;It wasn't hard to find this hotel when I emerged from the train station: it's a tall building with a big "Crowne Plaza" sign at the top. Three stars is the average rating here, and that seems right to me.  My room was not outstanding in any way, but it was comfortable enough and I slept well.  The bathroom was small:"narrow" is the first word that comes to mind.  The counter is a thin piece of moulded plastic -- not something that suggests luxury. Here are a few positives: the folk at the front desk were perfectly friendly:the elevators were fast-moving and fast-arriving:the hotel is well situated if you want to visit UIC or hang out in Greektown.  The gym is a room with a couple of Precors, some treadmills and even some free weights.  It looked OK but I skipped my workout to write yelp reviews.;3;1;0;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2877;2/9/2012;SA6NdD04SXnw7Lgz8L;ea3HFxRRo4gZOmlDle8IPA;Location is really good, the rates are pretty okay, and the design of the room is nice. We got Executice Suite on the 17th floor (as Platinum member) and the room was really beautiful, the washroom was nice and very clean, with lots of items as shampoo, lotions, mouth wash, eye mask, ear plugs, water, etc. and free Wi-Fi access. 2 balconies, nice views to the Sears Toweer and highway (I dont mind). Many restaurants around (many of them Greek) and Starbucks right accross the street! One minus though - they only have walet parking, no regular. So its pretty complicated to get the card whenever you want... However, I am very happy with my decision to stay here. Update: 2 minuses: 1) The heating - it was really loud and blowing in your face all night long, I couldnt even hair the TV (in bedroom). It was also little broken so the wind from outside was blowing inside like crazy. 2) No fridge in the room. I guess I could have asked for it so its no big deal.;4;2;1;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2878;4/1/2011;bYVFyFazxXKiC0nTdb2xJg;JUlMVyJQ6ijHCdMjs8bGhw;Nice hotel, but honestly I've had better experiences with the brand. The ups: -comfy beds -plenty of towels -pretty good price for location -good decor -key card access elevators -Great food districts in walking distance (randolph st, french market) -free wireless internet The downs: -outlets in the room were loose, including the bathroom -drone of constant highway traffic noise from outside. In the pits: -horrendously rank homeless guy dropping bricks in the first floor lobby bathroom, walked out without anyone even approaching him. ~$40 valet parking (what????) I can almost get my monthly pass for that much where I'm from!;3;1;1;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2879;8/16/2009;tIi59-WtYUP7kjNVrxbMgg;X3N5EMYP5Ah0WpJlBHWXGw;The Crowne Plaza was a decent place to stay for the 4 nights that we were in Chicago. It is within walking distance of the Willis Tower and the surrounding area, if you are willing to cross the highway, which we nicknamed the desert. There are two bus stops right across the street from the hotel, the 8 and the 20, both of which are very useful. Behind the hotel is a Walgreen's, as well as Greek Town. The staff at the hotel was always helpful and friendly, of course we only used them to check in, check out, and find the pool. And yes, they have a pool, well, not technically. But they give you passes to get into a pool in a residential tower two blocks away. When we got to the pool, it was an entire health club at our disposal. One more thing about the Crowne Plaza is that they had one of the best shower heads I've come across in a hotel. It was a rain style head with three points of articulation. Oh yeah, free wifi in the guestrooms was a major selling point as well.;4;6;1;2;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2880;12/2/2007;lrA6Hgmpr-iBqZRGKFKr1A;Lj2hYX2MIpId-Y1I7IEoxg;I stayed at the Crowne Plaza this past weekend and it far exceeded my expectations.  I had driven by the place a million times and it never seemed all that nice from the outside, but all of the renovations they did a few years ago have really done wonders for the interior.   The only downside is that they didn't have any rooms with king-sized beds available and I had to settle for 2 double beds.  Beyond that and a few burned out light bulbs, everything was great.  The decor was much more modern than other Crownes I've stayed at before.  They provide every room with what I guess you would call sleep accessories: eye mask, ear plugs, sleep CD, and aromatherapy linen spray.  I guess they really want to make sure you're knocked out.  I ended up not needing to use any of them because I was really tired and the beds are comfortable enough on their own, but it's nice to know they care.   The location isn't the greatest as far as things to do except for Greektown, but you're right off the expressway and close to the Loop so it's convenient to get pretty much anywhere in the city.;4;3;1;1;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2881;8/6/2008;N5lGOW2FoFltDHaep-q2QA;AyVI_VJ3My6ibiIkcLQYGw;We've stayed here before with a less than stellar stay but gave it another chance this past weekend and was much more pleased.. This Crowne Plaza is in Greektown so if you love Greek food.. you will LOVE walking down the street and having your pick of a number of Greek restaurants.. I also like how there's a 24-hour supermarket (Dominick's) a block away and a Walgreen's the opposite way, a block away. The rooms are cozy. The sliding door to the bathroom is a bit bothersome. There's a number of amenities of which borrowing an umbrella is one, is available. Room service till 11pm. I also like how you need a room card to use the elevators.. it adds a safety factor. During our last stay, we had problems with other guests harassing us with no help from the staff. The shower didn't drain and maintenance said they fixed it but for the entire weekend we showered in standing water.. This stay was much better.. the only thing that we can say anything about is housekeeping. After having our room cleaned, they never replaced the glasses or sundries and the towels were folded and messily placed on the shelf. Other than that, everything was fine. And! lastly, valet was great in getting us cabs and even a limo for us one night.. (crucial for us with none of our own transportation);3;2;2;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2882;8/12/2009;tWZbInEgF79jTrtkL97XyA;6euawCABdGNPwNIgCk4VAw;I wanted a central spot to stay in while on a four day trip to Chicago that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg so i choose the CP. Location: As written in other reviews the hotel is located right by a freeway on the boarder of Greek-town. I personally found it convenient since I cabbed all of my nightly excursions. I was able to get to where I wanted to be quickly and cheaply by avoiding street lights. The CP Metro has two bus stops that can connect you with the major transfer hubs for both buses and trains. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a full service supermarket named Dominick's across the street from the main entrance. Behind the hotel you can find a Walgreen's, Starbucks and various eateries which are open until the wee hours of the morning. Hotel : From the outside the CP metro looks very outdated but don't judge just yet. The inside has been fully remodeled in a very sleek and modern motif. It modern with a splash of Miami. The hotel offers king and double rooms most with small balcony. I had a great room facing the Sears Tower. A business center, and fitness center are also offered. The CP Metro has a full service restaurant and bar located on the ground floor named Retro . A 1940's American Eatery and Martini Bar offering American classics with a contemporary flair. Room: All rooms are fully carpeted tiled and offer a flat panel television, mini fridge and free Wi-Fi ( it was rather slow so I used the cable connection instead). The bathrooms were average in size and offered a pocket door instead of a standard one. Beds were comfortable. Overall the room was very clean. The staff I encountered were courteous, friendly and accommodating. I arrived early and they held my bags I also requested a double room because I had previously requested a king. Everyone was really nice and I got no attitudes at all. Hotel tends to be busy on weekdays since it host various company meetings and trainings. During my stay folks from United Airlines were there for a training seminar. Within Walking Distance Walgreen's 24 Hour Pharmacy, Starbucks, Sears Tower , United Center, and Harpo Studios;4;3;3;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og

Check in was easy and service was friendly (could have given me a heads up about that temporary charge they put on your credit card though).  The rooms are super nice and are on the larger size.  Rain showerheads and modern-ish decor.  Flat screen and balcony (with view of Sears Tower if you lean over and look east). Solid bet for a great stay.;4;0;0;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og

The bed is not the most awesome bed I've slept in, but it's pretty up there. The bathrooms are clean to the point where I was wondering what they used on their grout to keep it so white. Even the shampoo/lotion/eye-mask/etc treats were good. All the staff were nice and helpful. The location is right next to Greektown and UIC so it was optimally situated for my purposes. I'd stay there again for sure. Even room service was extra special. P.S. they have a free late checkout which was awesome.;4;6;2;1;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og

If we didnt take it we would lose ALL the money.Final in the room we find two small beds. Im a big guy. So, To make a long story short. After all the planning and money spent, I spent my anniversary sleeping alone! My wife woke the next day with a rash from the detergent they use.

2886;7/30/2011;2UfRDIZodZ0blYZLjNeGqw;57H49pZo-1-kDQ6XmuYmyA;At first I thought this hotel was ok. But I had to stay here for two weeks because of work. The best thing I can say about this hotel is that it's clean, and for me the location was ideal. However, customer service wise, I have never had a worse experience. You have to park valet, although most of the time the parking lot is not full. And, parking is expensive. I was sworn at by the valet because he couldn't find my keys. The desk staff has a way of making issues with check in seem like your fault, and when I had a problem with internet connection, I was told to deal with it myself. So anyway, if I had a choice I would not stay here.;2;0;0;0;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og
2887;4/7/2009;eVTul0kSo5uNbpnjC4lwpg;6yI7fmSF1vmmqv-rtan3LA;It was my sister's bachelorette party this past weekend and we wanted to stay in a hotel to make it a little more special than crashing at home after the bars.  Let me say that we were not the yellong, screaming annoying, typical bachelorette party.  We just wanted it to be classy and a good time.  No flashing penis' for us! After calling around to what felt like millions hotels, I got ahold of a very friendly call center rep who suggested the Crown Plaza.  I told her that it was a party and that we wanted a suite with a sitting area so some of the girls could  come and have cocktails before dinner.  She was more than helpful and even said she would put a special note that it was a bachelorette party so they would give us special treatment. Special treatment was the very last thing that we recieved!  When I went to the front desk to check in the girl couldn't even crack a smile. Her name is Angela by the way.  When I told her I was checking in and that we were a bachelorette party the very first thing she said was that "this is a no party hotel, if security gets called we will kicked you out."  Seriously?  So I politely told her that we were not going to get out of control, it was just a few girls coming to have a drink before dinner.  Without a word she handed me my keys and told me my room number. Once in the room we were unpleasently surprised that there was no sitting area.  The room just has 2 double beds.  I specifically asked for a suite.  So I called down to the front desk and miss Angela answered the phone. When I told her that we did not have the right room, she told me that we were only booked for a double bed room and if we wanted to move it would be $50.  We were already paying $280 for the room, I was not about to cave for another $50.  I tried reasoning with her but she refused to budge.  She never apologized for the inconvience or even tried to be polite.  When I told her that we might have to find another hotel she told me that we already had checked in and would have to be charged the full amount if we left.   I was pissed. So we decided to stay and I would deal with the bitchy lady the next day.  When I went to check out I talked to the girl at the desk ( a different one).  I told her how extremely unhappy I was witht their hotel.  She was a lot better (the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1).  She told me that I should have had the suite and that they did over charge me for the double room.  She very kindly lowered the bill which I appreciated. She also told me that Angela was a supervisor.  If that is a suporvisor at a 4 star hotel, then I would hate to see one at a 2 star.   There are a lot of hotels in Chicago.  I would not suggest the Crown Plaza.;2;3;0;1;wLjR0DkA4zxu8iqbUQc0Og

Everything was satisfactorily clean, but I can't think of any outstanding services provided. I've received the same service at Holiday Inn Expresses before. That's not to be insulting, rather I'd expect more complimentary services for the price I was charged. For example, this could include the free breakfast vouchers my colleagues at the conference received (and I didn't) or maybe unlocking the movie channel a couple of times during my stay.

This is a motel, people!  It's very outdated, but it's CLEAN.  The bathroom appliances (toilet, tub, sink) in my room were all 70's chic gold.   The king size bed was pretty comfortable, and the huge window was an added bonus. The walls are THIN, so you get to hear the dude in the room next to you bang his girlfriend at 6:00 AM -- which is an odd way to wake up.  For me?  I could care less -- it's all about the experience! The breakfast is pretty damn rad -- simple, but good. Oh, and the WiFi is powerful:  I asked the front desk, and their provider is Comcast, so you get uber fast cable Internet.  I'll never stay anywhere else in Chicago;4;2;1;2;h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ
2894;6/28/2011;k7XMPxs0ubyczECoA5wLYQ;QQnPbpNzopsqAY0h8TRRpw;I was hesitant to go with the three star vote because frankly, there isn't much to get excited about but Heart O' Chicago Motel fills a niche as a budget friendly motel in the city of Chicago - something there is a huge shortage of. Our experience was positive overall.  Here were the pros and cons. PROS Relatively inexpensive when compared to city hotel prices.  Our room that had two double beds was $92 plus taxes. Our room was clean and in the morning I saw several housekeeping employees starting on the rooms so that told me they have adequate staff to keep the motel looking its best. It's on the city's north side, not far from Andersonville.  The Clark and Ridge location puts you convenient to many popular north side eateries, shops and of course, Wrigley Field. CONS It can be a bit noisy, especially if you're not used to "city noise". Parking.  While they do have a private lot, there is an equal number of spots per room, which means if two cars of customers are staying in one room, two spaces are used.  We saw cars blocked in (ours included) in the morning due to this. The bathroom is pretty small and the shower curtain was a bi-fold style, made of hard plastic that, when closed, made the small shower area even more cramped. The Four Seasons it isn't but then again, it's about a quarter of the price too.  It's a budget motel in an expensive city.  If you're budget conscious, you might want to check it out.;3;7;1;0;h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ
2895;8/12/2010;Q00tzLkQG;C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw;This place is a great homebase for those on a budget in Chicago.  Clean,  but pretty bare bones.  Free parking is an awesome bonus.  BYO shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, hairdryer,etc.  And be sure to coordinate your PJ's with 70s yellow. Stayed there in Aug and the AC kept it totally cool, but was crazy loud.   It's not a luxury retreat, but it's also under $100/night for a king-sized room.  Would definitely stay here again.;3;0;0;2;h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ

2897;4/3/2011;F5fpVUZvZnf2U;JtrmbKVE3uaD321CBCW9Dw;Very funky indeed, but it will do if all you're looking for is a clean place to sleep at reasonable cost. The door to our room looked as though it had been on the receiving end of a steel-toed boot recently, which we found a little disconcerting. There was a small TV mounted on the wall with only a few channels, no towel bars at all in the bathroom, and absolutely no amenities. For aficionados of 60s touches like fleshtone bath fixtures, the originals are still in place here. Worst of all was NO internet connection, and people at the front desk seemed clueless as to what a router was, or how to get online. This was a major inconvenience, as I had work to get done. The part-time elderly guy at the counter shrugged and referred me to the 24 hour Kinkos nearby. The "breakfast" was your typical motel carb-fest and really bad coffee. We found the parade of quirky characters coming in and out entertaining, except for the woman running around yelling in the parking lot at 5 a.m. I will say that everything was very clean, and we'd probably stay here again solely because of the price, as long as we didn't need to get online for anything.;2;0;0;0;h-U_YfWBK2u_Vqo8AVA4KQ
2898;7/6/2012;or;7BiWqhSJ-h0drMp7xCZC8w;I stayed here about 3 weeks ago. I booked two rooms, but they gave me confirmations for four rooms instead. If I hadn't called to fix this, they would have charged me for cancelling two rooms. The stay at the hotel was alright. The rooms were clean and very basic. The dinner downstairs was alright. The buffet wasn't very consistent. One beef dish was very bland, but the next batch they brought out was overwhelmingly filled with pepper corns. Like I stated earlier, I booked the rooms with my card. However, a different card by a different person was used to pay with it. I received copies of the receipt by email and my card number isn't listed whatsoever as the form of payment. Now, can you explain to me why I got charged $200 by the hotel? Never again.;1;1;0;0;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA

2900;8/26/2008;U1gp2yPIiK5ZgSY-eTQLSA;I75eStti80sC9G4EFd674w;In the grand scheme of things this hotel was soooo not worth the 189  dollars  + 28 for parking, internet fees of 10 dollars per day for a grand total of 231 per night not including taxes.  The only reason they get away with ripping people is because of it's proximity to the school and people will pay or else. I've stayed at much nicer marriotts with better amenities with a reasonable price. I was there to attend a wedding. The valet staff was reasonably nice.  But the desk staff was rude and unhelpful when they booked the bride & groom in adjoining rooms instead of on separate floors as requested.  After they tried to put her out, I ended up giving her my room to appease everyone.  The sad part was that they tried to chastise her and tell her if she had asked one of us earlier she wouldn't have had to cause such drama.;4;2;0;0;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA

2902;12/16/2009;LN2M15zKwTy8CT9OIVJqAg;_aVCYt2Bxn5vmkN-d1Mq7g;OVERPRICED and UNCOMFORTABLE!!! Hospitality was okay. Concierge was helpful when I wanted to find a place to eat, though that isn't asking much. Room looked really nice... until I went to bed. The most terrible mattress I ever experienced. I had what felt like the worst case of insomnia that lasted for HOURS. And the noise from the shower next door kept me up and caused my heart to race. I started to get angry. It was driving me mad! Drip-Drip-Drip-Drip, just wouldn't stop! In fact, it sounded amplified. Maybe the tub materials and leaky faucet? Is it rude to knock on your next-door neighbors door and ask them to sacrifice a clean towel for the tub to catch the drip? I was sure it would last for fifteen minutes. But it went on forever. Earplugs hardly helped. I vacillated about calling down to switch rooms, but I was exhausted from my travels and I imagined the effort. I thought I might end up in a room that was worse. Or it might take an hour. Packing and unpacking around mid-night would not be fun! When I left at 7:15am I wasn't in the mood to argue upon check-out. If I EVER return to this area, I will INSIST on staying somewhere else. Breakfast was overpriced and I didn't dare. I was certain the quality would be poor. No complementary buffet for the price? That's ludicrous. At least then I could judge the food by having a preview! ps. Sorry for venting! I know it's no fun to read.;1;2;0;2;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA
2903;6/15/2011;pZIgxLAZ4bT1ttaofhLIqg;ZsHdj6zFhdzvNUR4Ur9iew;It's a bit far. I did priceline, so it was okay. It was a 10 minute walk to Pink Line, and 0.5mile walk to blue line. They do have shuttles but they run only on the hour and half. Great if you have people at the hospital. My sister liked how big the room was. Love that it was a non-smoking building. They provide Bath and Body Works shampoo. Downside: no free wi-fi. There is a computer you can use downstairs to check email, and another computer to print your boarding pass. I think past midnight, they lock the sliding doors so you have to show the receptionist your key card before she'll open it. That was a bit annoying. Rooms are clean, neat, white. Lots of lights available. We had a fridge in our room which was nice. The hair dryer was ionic and ceramic :) And they do have coffee/ tea in the room. No complementary breakfast. The walls are thin which may just be all of Chicago, but anytime someone leaves the room you can hear it shut. For the price, which was less than 180/ night, not bad. Which I could find a place closer though to other amenties, but it gave me a chance to explore that side of Chicago. I give it a four based on the neatness of the room, the fridge, and all. Receptionist did not seem that welcoming or friendly, they just were doing the job. not very helpful in getting to places but it's okay I asked other people. That's it.;4;1;0;0;Gh4Tb2qCBUCOd5r7jqKnGA

The Staff at this place flat out ROCKS!!! Angie and the rest of the front desk/hotel staff were super friendly and helpful. We originally had a second floor room which was a problem since our Greyhound is really bad at going up and down steps. Angie got us a room on the ground floor and made sure it was directly below our original room  to ease the transition. I did not find the rooms to be as bad as some have posted. They are what they are.. We had a flat screen tv, modern HVAC, and a decent wi-fi signal. The decor was typical Ramada Inn and as Lisa B conveyed, it's in a decent location. My only complaints are that we did not have a fridge in the room and the doors opening and closing were very loud. I doubt you can find a better pet friendly hotel for the price in the area.;4;2;1;0;BISUDalmPulSzHvsO3PhDA

2909;7/22/2011;9IGcFUoYcWDOwMuw6-xCXA;QoYZN2TRRLKBEXFfjczLPQ;Ramada - Lake Shore Drive, Chicago- Stayed here two nights, July 19th and 20th, 2011. This hotel is past due for a tear down and a rebuild. 1st room - no air conditioning 2nd room - no working toilet (water pressure in the automatic flush valve was insufficient to flush anything, not even a piece of toilet paper) Other defects - broken TV on/off switch in room two, broken a/c control in room 2, cracked sink bowl in room 2, no cups in room 1, TV remote does not work in either room. Common Area defects - Hallways are hot - not air conditioned, elevators are slow, call lights are not lighted, 2nd elevator from parking garage in disrepair, no security and direct access from street outside to hotel floorspace using elevator 2, not enough parking available. Cosmetic - room décor is combination 70s and 80s. It's not timeless - just old. The bathroom finish materials are plastic and cheap and look terrible. Pluses - staff is working with a failing albatross, yet maintains a positive attitude toward guests - for the most part, housekeeping is doing a herculean job to keep bedding and towels and rooms in clean condition - for the most part. Negatives - staff management protocol near full booking is to re-sell a reserved room at 4 pm. I learned at 6:30 p.m. that my credit card reserved room was given away 2 1/2 hours earlier at 4 p.m. while I was in a jet flying to Chicago - amazing poor customer relations on this item. That's how I ended up with the room without air-conditioning - it's all they could offer. And because the entire city hotel system was booked, I had no choice. Unbelievable. I've never heard of releasing a room at the very moment it becomes available for occupancy...The second night, they switched me to room #2 which had A/C but no working toilet. Oh well, they tried, I guess. Overall conclusion: Do whatever you can to stay elsewhere. This hotel is broken. However, if you are an intrepid type and you don't mind hardships like heat and no working toilet, and if you are pressed for a room because there are no other vacancies within 30 miles, it is possible to sleep here and shower here - there is minimal but sufficient comfort to accomplish that due to the decent housekeeping. I found the cleanliness of my two rooms acceptable. The lack of a working toilet could be a problem, though.;1;1;0;0;BISUDalmPulSzHvsO3PhDA
2910;5/3/2007;qHvd-iZaWA8;zrdkuuPFlNkLTSa9gMqbvQ;Disclaimer -- I never personally stayed there but my in-laws stayed there twice.-- With that out of the way I have visited the room and the pool. Not really excited about either.  Their room overlooked the pool on the first floor. First the room- It for real looked like Motel 6! I am not kidding. Like when you are on a  road trip and you just need a place to sleep where you don't have to worry about getting hit by a semi truck. Yeah one of those places. It did have the standard cable and the really fake I am a quilt but light enough to be a sheet thing going on. Of course in red! Second the pool-- One word Dirty! Leaves all over the place.  And the tiles were turning black from grime and dirt. But hey it was cheap and about 2 minutes from our apt. It was also close to the Jackson Park Express # 6. And the saving grace of this place is it had parking!!;1;0;0;0;BISUDalmPulSzHvsO3PhDA
2911;8/29/2011;-qXBzBvKZuLV6cVuLUBvtg;CVN9z9ZtbECntdLX-MmIZw;My wife and I stayed at the Lake Shore Ramada only because our friends had their wedding reception at the nearby University of Chicago.  Yes, it was a place to lay down after a night of drinking and dancing, but not much sleeping was done...no, not because of THAT....get your mind our of the gutter. Issue #1 - I found out king size bed to be very uncomfortable. Issue #2 - Either every single guest in the Ramada was speaking through a bull horn, or the walls were paper thin.  Either way, starting somewhere between dawn and when I finally fell asleep, I was able to hear conversations, other people showering, dressers opening and closing, and everything else people do in hotel rooms.  No not THAT. Issue #3 - Though this is beyond the control of the hotel staff, I must also mention that there was a bird right outside our window who, the very second the sun shone it's face over Lake Michigan, took it upon itself to inform all other living creatures that it was morning at the top of it's tiny, little lungs. Other unpleasantries: -Understaffed front desk.  It took a good twenty minutes to check in. -Hookers in the lobby.  Not call girls.  Not ladies of the evening.  Straight up white trash, track marked hookers. The good things: -Relatively in expensive for a Chicago hotel. -"Free" parking. -Right on the Lake.  We were fortunate enough to view a regatta race going on in the distance as we checked in. Overall, I don't plan on staying there again unless under similar circumstances in which a night at the Lake Shore Ramada beats possibly killing children because of drunk driving.  This place is not horrible, but not favorable.;2;0;0;0;BISUDalmPulSzHvsO3PhDA
2912;11/16/2010;vf78HlnP02sEbAGEXFIWHw;Rr5OAotIzOSJP0bAb6RDrg;I stayed at this place (Nov. 10-13) and I initially had to change rooms twice before finally settling on the last room.  The first two only provided heating and the wireless internet did not work at all, both located in their main building.  The receptionist said she would try and reset the router the first couple of times, but that never worked and I also noticed that the refrigerator did not work in the second room. The room I did stay in was located in a separate bldg across the way overlooking the pool, which was emptied, full of leaves and I'm assuming because it was off-season and temperatures were close to freezing at night.  The room wasn't as dated as the rooms in the main building, but the exterior walls were a bit worn and a chipped.  With that said, I decided to give it a try anyways because the room had wireless internet that worked, the fridge worked and it had both a.c. and heating available. I should point out, that the refrigerator in the room worked well for beverages only.  The walls were extremely thin, but I did not notice that until my 2nd night there, since it was practically empty when I initially arrived here, but you will hear door slams from the other rooms next door if it is fully booked.  On the plus side: Access to the #6 bus into downtown Chicago was easily accessible (about 3 blocks away).   Overall, I received a fair rate on Priceline and would only recommend staying here if you are a deep sleeper, on a budget and don't need a fast internet connection(as I mentioned, it's spotty).  FYI, There is however a small computer room with a printer in the lobby guests can use.;3;2;0;0;BISUDalmPulSzHvsO3PhDA

Go away from here if you're a plus-sized person although it's just at the edge of tolerance for average sized people. The WiFi was very slow and oversubscribed. It failed several times. The restaurant was covered in another review. It's not bad. There is no breakfast plan here, although they will serve up breakfast for group bookings. The rooms don't have much sound insulation, and we could tell you verbatim the phone conversations in the room next door. We didn't try the TV, although it looked good.

It is a luxury boutique in the heart of the Gold Coast, easily within walking distance of Michigan Avenue, State Street, and Navy Pier. The staff is exceptionally friendly. They provide twenty-four-hour room service, concierge service, and the front desk staff and waitstaff are even cheerful late at night. The rooms are modern, well decorated, and comfortable. They feature flat-screen satellite televisions, ihome alarm clocks, and many other conveniences one would expect from a luxury hotel, without the sameness of the chains.;5;0;0;0;S_qmb0Uzm_cNoRjSvZ6y1w
2935;4/30/2009;P0quEbUf_bKM4rX_ZeXPOg;f2q9k_3Wrm2LjRSIqJYx_g;I stayed here last Sunday (April 26) with my friends while we were visiting Chicago and I was not impressed one bit. Our experience started off over the phone where my friend called to see if we can get an early check-in. The front desk clerk who took answered the call was quite unprofessional and sounded like she dumb founded, so my friend hung up. The check-in seemed to be fine until we actually went to our room. The bellman helped us to our original room (1423) and was very courteous and informative. When we finally opened the door to our room, immediately we smelled a stench of either vomit or rotten milk. *uGh* GROSS. We questioned the bellman to see if he can smell the odor and he said no and proceeded to call the house keeping. I did not like the fact that the bellman sounded a bit rude when he stated over the phone "the guests in 1423 thinks there's an odor in here, but I don't smell anything and I am highly sensitive of any stench." I'm sorry, but if there was really no odor, would you really think I'd waste my time fussing over the room when I could be around town. After the call was made, the bellman told us if there was anything wrong he was sure they would be able to accommodate us and still refused that there was an odor in our room and said all the rooms smelled like that. The bellman left and house keeping came in with his spray bottle in his hand. Of course, right away he smelled the odor and we pretty much told him that won't help. So we called the front desk to make arrangements for a new room. Little did we know that we were going to get moved to the 10th floor which had the stench of cigarettes throughout the floor. *uGh* gross. We pay the suppose "4-star" price at a non-smoking hotel for a reason and I felt like we stayed at a 2 or 3 star MOTEL because of the service and uncleanliness of the hotel. I honestly wished we would of just booked two nights at the Wyndham.;2;0;0;0;LUmAQaRrAleKdXZd8On16Q

2938;9/15/2012;TJjtYIODV4USv7lesVTlEw;r6krSg8pFAKHIWgGluk-AA;A post scriptum to my earlier less than positive review.  A few days after returning home the Hotel Lincoln sent me a survey to fill out about my stay. I again gave less than stellar comments. Imagine my very pleasant surprise when a day or so later I was contacted by a member of the staff, who 1) apologized for my inconvenience, 2) told me that one of my suggestions had already been acted upon, and they were looking into my comments about the room, and 3) and informed me that he was sending me a certificate for a complimentary night's stay at the hotel. I am impressed with the personal follow-up and attention. This is more than I would have ever expected, and have not experienced this type of courteous response from any other hotel I have stayed at. Kudos to the Hotel Lincoln for going above and beyond the call of duty in trying to make the customer happy. I am looking forward to returning to Chicago in the near future.;3;0;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA
2939;8/26/2012;llrXx4ugDoPJFw0LpDZ3JA;l0cdsSz4T75y4vO1056bzQ;My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel because it was pretty cheap (112$ a night) and had some great reviews. I have to say, we were overall pleased with it. When we got there, the staff was VERY nice and helpful. Our room was very cute, very clean, but very small. Not a big deal thought if you're not going to spend too much time in it. The hotel was right across from Lincoln Park (really pretty park with a free zoo in it). And close to buses and trains that would take you downtown or to several attractions.The only negative point I could think of when it comes to this hotel is the parking. You can do valet for over 40$ a day. Instead, we parked at a garage a few blocks down for $20 a day, and used the transit system the entire trip.;4;0;0;0;PRQGk-UbR7FkUFYvSOiHmA

Do not book this hotel if you are looking for a large, luxurious suite but please book it if you are looking for a hotel that is a little hip, amazing location and a great staff.

One of the air conditioners made such a loud erratic noise that I was unable to get a good night's sleep. IN addition, garbage bins are rolled down the alley late very early in the morning and added the the noise. I would suggest somewhere that actually has working, quiet air conditioners and does not have so many rooms facing the loud alley.;2;0;0;0;gCdjyQeE0uRKCh7mVmnZzQ

2947;8/22/2011;M9sPYJENivJyWYuLwy7SCw;oVzvotuHA5u5Ob0E7i58Cw;Short Version: I am very torn about this place because there are some great things, but then there are things that I think are pretty bad for how much it costs to stay here.  I booked three nights for a standard king.  Long Version:I'll start off with the good:1. The door man, and I cannot remember his name but you'll know him when you see him: he was suuuuper nice and remembered my name after the first time we met.  The valet guys and the guy who helped me take my luggage to my room were all nice and accommodating.2. I was afraid the location was a little too far north, but it was actually at an ideal spot.  I was able to run to the lake, walk to Millennium Park and there are stores everywhere.  It was really convenient for me and at night it was nice to just walk around the neighborhood.3. The bed was so comfortable and the tub was great for relaxing.  Part of the reason I chose the hotel was for the tub.Now for the bad:1. As someone else said, this place needs a "facelift." My room showed a lot of wear and tear, especially the shower.  I had to forcefully open and close the door every time because it had this weird rubber stopper on it that was falling off.2. You have to pay for wi-fi: $10/day.  I just think that's really steep, especially since other hotels that aren't as fancy give it to you for free.3. The bed doesn't have a fitted sheet.  I think that is so weird and you can just see the mattress from certain angles.  And flat sheets never stay put, so with one pull you're all of a sudden on the mattress.4. I paid $45 a night for parking and I found out later that they just park the car outside somewhere nearby.  I thought it would be indoors at the hotel.  If I had known that I would have just parked in a parking garage because the whole point was so that my car would be in a building and close by. I had to wait 30 minutes for my car (even though I called down for it 15 minutes before and they assured me it would be there in 10 minutes).  Also, my clock and radio surface is warped so I can barely read the time.None of these things are horrible, but for a place that touts itself as a luxury hotel and charges that much money for a night, I just don't think it's worth it at all.;3;0;0;0;rpP9iZsT3NC-Z4pUtQGoiA
